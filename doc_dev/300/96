<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; TRIP  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ROCK 'N' ROLL is road music. Think of all those traveling songs -- the
Grateful Dead's "Truckin'," Chuck Berry's "No Particular Place to Go," Bruce
Springsteen's "Born to Run," AC/DC's "Highway to Hell" -- and you begin to
understand why they started installing stereos in cars in the first place.;  
Rock and the road are burned together forever in our souls -- and if you don't
believe that, try driving to Los Angeles the day after someone steals your
tape deck. The trip is dull, slow and really, really quiet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But crank up "Born to be Wild" and the miles begin to race by. We can't all
be Peter Fonda on a Harley, but we can all sing along.;   Why stop there? Rock
'n' roll doesn't have to be just a way to grease the wheels along the way. It
can be more than what you do while you're on your way; it can be why you're
going in the first place.;   Elvis fans have figured that out. Graceland has
become their mecca, their Holy Grail, and for good reason. There's the house
in Memphis, a bunch of gift shops, the King's plane and cars and even his
grave.;   But Memphis is in Tennessee, and who can afford a trip like that
these days?;   The good news is, you don't have to.;   There's nothing quite
as glamorous as Graceland in these parts, but there is plenty of rock 'n' roll
history in California. From the Sunset Grill in Hollywood to the Grateful
Dead's old haunts in San Francisco, the following list should give you a good
start.;   Be forewarned that most of these destinations are tawdry, tacky and
in depressed neighborhoods, but the same can be said for rock 'n' roll.;   Hit
the road, Jack.;   (box) WALK THIS WAY -- The RockWalk is to music what the
Hollywood Walk of Fame is to film. Launched in 1985 outside the Guitar Center
-- a huge, music store in Hollywood -- the RockWalk is a concrete tribute to
rock. Among the handprints and signatures you'll find there are those of Roy
Orbison, Eddie Van Halen, Stevie Wonder, Dick Clark, Keith Moon, Les Paul and
Smokey Robinson. A videotape of great -- or, at least, really loud -- guitar
heroes plays overhead.;   And if you ask at the counter inside the store, they
just might tell you about the nearby alley bedrooms -- now torn down -- where
Guns N' Roses once lived. 7425 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood; (213) 874-1060.;  
(box) SOUL KITCHEN -- From the romantic longings of "Down at the Sunset
Grill," you might think Don Henley had a sprawling, sun-draped bar and grill
in mind. You'd be wrong. Just down the street from the RockWalk sits the real
Sunset Grill, and it ain't much: just a tiny hot dog stand with a half-dozen
stools out on the sidewalk. But hey, it feels real. At 7439 Sunset Blvd.,
Hollywood; (213) 876-3073.;   (box) OLD-TIME ROCK 'N' ROLL -- If it's
classic-rock ambiance you want, you won't do much better than a visit to the
venerable Fillmore in San Francisco. An incredible incubator for the "San
Francisco sound," the Fillmore was the place to see quintessential '60s-era
acts such as the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead -- and pick up a
free apple from the basket by the door.;   Sadly, the Airplane has flown, the
Dead is off plowing bigger fields and the Fillmore was closed by the Loma
Prieta earthquake. But the Fillmore has died many deaths before; hold on for a
while and it will probably be back. At 1805 Geary St., San Francisco.;   (box)
MANSION ON THE HILL -- The Jefferson Airplane lived and partied in the
friendly confines of the Airplane House, a 17-room, three-story colonial
revival-style mansion that overlooks Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. The
band sold the place back in 1986 -- the asking price was $795,000 -- but you
can still drive by and imagine the smoky days inside. At 2400 Fulton St., San
Francisco.;   (box) SHOOTING STAR -- The Elvis Presley movie "Wild In the
Country" was filmed in and around St. Helena and Calistoga. This rock film
classic was released in 1961 and features the King as an angry rural aspiring
writer.;   (box) HOUSE PARTY -- Elvis, of course, took up primary residence at
Graceland. But during his movie-making days, the King spent a lot of time in
several homes in and around Los Angeles. The most important -- a former home
of the Shah of Iran where Elvis met the Beatles -- has been torn down. But
several other Elvis houses remain.;   In 1965, the King rented a place in
Stone Canyon at 10550 Rocca Place. Later, he paid $400,000 for a place at 1174
Hilcrest Road, which has been preserved in its Elvisian splendor. Later still,
he moved with Priscilla and Lisa Marie to 144 Monovale Road, a house that
would belong to Telly Savalas after the King died.;   (box) GOLDEN SLUMBERS --
If that's not enough Elvis for you, check out Ableser's Fine Jewelry, the
descendant of the store that designed the King's gold TCB -- "Taking Care of
Business" -- necklaces. Elvis bought tons of them; you can buy one, too. 251
North Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (213) 274-3088.;   (box) RHINESTONE COWBOY
-- You probably won't get a glimpse of Michael Jackson out herding cattle in a
white glove, but you can drive by his 2,700-acre Neverland Valley Ranch -- the
site of Liz Taylor's recent nuptials -- in the Santa Ynez Valley, two hours
north of Los Angeles. From Highway 101 in Santa Barbara County, take Highway
154 southwest to Figueroa Mountain Road. Go north on Figueroa Mountain Road
two or three miles. Jackson's ranch is on the left, just across the street
from Midland School.;   (box) GOING TO A GO-GO -- For many years, the
Whisky-a-Go-Go was rock 'n' roll in Los Angeles. Before they were rock stars,
the Doors were the house band at this legendary rock club. The club, in fact,
was painted red recently for the filming of Oliver Stone's "Doors" movie, but
at the moment it's sporting a lovely fuchsia look, courtesy of a local band.; 
 These days, the Whisky is host mostly to heavy-metal bands, but if you can
stand the noise, you might just see the next big thing. At 8901 Sunset Blvd.,
Hollywood; (213) 652-4202.;   (box) LIGHT MY FIRE -- If the Doors of
Perception have always been slammed shut on you, you might find some
inspiration and edification by wandering around the beachside community of
Venice. The Doors got their start there, and Jim Morrison wrote some of the
band's most famous songs while sitting on the rooftop of his Venice apartment,
watching the passing parade roll by below. He wrote "Hello, I Love You," for
instance, as he and Ray Manzarek watched a beautiful woman stroll down the
beach.;   (box) SCHOOL DAYS -- Los Angeles being Los Angeles, the original
home of the Wilson kids -- otherwise known as the Beach Boys -- has been moved
to make way for a freeway. And Dr. Fred Wagner, Brian Wilson's former music
teacher, says much of the teen life that the Beach Boys portrayed in their
songs has disappeared. The drive-ins, the hangouts -- "Those things just
aren't here anymore," he says. But you can still visit one famous Beach Boys
landmark: Hawthorne High School, immortalized in their 1963 hit "Be True to
Your School." At 4859 West El Segundo Blvd., Hawthorne.;   (box) SAN FRANCISCO
NIGHTS -- It started as a boardinghouse for regular folks, but when Pigpen
moved in, everybody else pretty much moved out. So it happened that a pretty
little house in the middle of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury became home for
the Grateful Dead.;   At the heyday of Haight-Ashbury, the house became party
central for the Dead's late organist, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, the band and its
fans. And, it also drew the attention of the San Francisco police, who busted
the entire band there for possession of marijuana in 1967. At 710 Ashby, San
Francisco.  </TEXT>
