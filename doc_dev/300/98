   The leader of the striking Writers Guild
of America says television and film producers have informed the
union that contract talks will be broken off, but a spokesman for
the producers denies the allegation.
   The strike, in its 20th week, already has led to sweeping
layoffs in the entertainment industry and has shredded the fall
television schedule.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the WGA West, told a group
of reporters Thursday that the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers will not seek a contract agreement at a
bargaining session set for Saturday.
   Visibly upset, Walton declared he was ``nonplussed'' by the
alliance's decision, which he said was relayed to him Thursday
afternoon in a telephone call from alliance negotiator J. Nicholas
Counter III.
   Counter contradicted Walton's account of the conversation, but
Walton's version was corroborated by a second WGA executive, Mona
Mangan, who said she was a party to the call.
   According to Walton, Counter called the union to explain the
position the alliance will take in a negotiating session scheduled
for Saturday by federal mediator Leonard Farrell.
   The Saturday session was called by Farrell because full
bargaining teams have not met since June 16. The proposed contract
that arose from that session was rejected by the guild on June 22.
   The two sides are divided sharply on fees for reruns of one-hour
television programs shown in this country and for all programs
broadcast overseas.
   Walton reported that Counter said, ```No deal will be made.
There will be nothing there Saturday. Nothing will happen ... (and)
forces outside of the collective bargaining process will have to
resolve this.''
   Walton said he was so surprised by Counter's statement that he
called him back to confirm what he had said.
   ``We felt and do feel that we have been in good faith in
attempting to reach a deal,'' Walton told reporters at guild
headquarters.
   ``But throughout the last four to five months, there have been
weeks upon weeks where the alliance has simply refused to talk to
us.''
   Counter said that Walton's version was ``wrong ... I certainly
would not prejudge what would happen.''
   Meanwhile, CBS on Thursday announced four new fall series,
including a Dick Clark variety show, which either don't require
writers or come from abroad.
   Clark's show will contain specialty acts that require no
writers. On another show,``High Risk,'' people with adventuresome
jobs or hobbies tell their stories to the camera.
   The other shows are exempt from the Writers Guild because they
are made abroad. They are ``Dolphin Bay,'' a one-hour drama from
Australia and ``Jake's Journey,'' a half-hour comedy from England.
