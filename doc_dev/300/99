   Waylon Jennings is confident his 10-city
concert tour with Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson
will ``breathe new life into us.''
   The country music stars, who have recorded two albums as the
``Highwaymen,'' open their first joint tour this month in Houston.
   ``I think we're going to find when we get through doing this,
that it's going to breathe new life into us,'' Jennings told
reporters Thursday.
   Kristofferson said he hopes the tour can eventually go overseas.
   ``We want to take this all over the world _ play Moscow, Berlin,
Sydney ... Tokyo,'' he said.
   Their first album, ``Highwayman,'' released in 1985, has sold
more than 1 million copies, and ``Highwayman 2'' was released this
week.

   Billy Joel says he didn't start the fire,
but he certainly helped fan one under Cloquet High School freshman
Kevin Shutes.
   Shutes correctly identified and described 116 of the 119 people,
places and events in Joel's hit song, ``We Didn't Light the Fire,''
in a trivia contest sponsored by the Carlton County Historical
Society.
   His reward included the $25 top prize, a year's membership in
the society, free pizzas, car washes and movie passes.
   ``I thought all the entrants really did a great job,'' said the
society's director Ellen Quinn, who organized the contest to help
broaden the students' knowledge of history.
   ``I was surprised by the amount of time they put in and how
complete their answers were,'' she said Thursday. Shutes ``had very
complete answers and even went into a little commentary.''
   Shutes described ``Woodstock,'' a word in the song, as ``a
massive rock 'n' roll orgy that involved 500,000 young people out
for a good time. They completely took over the area and indulged in
sex and drugs freely. The sanitary conditions were said to have
been disgusting.''
   He identified ``Studebaker'' as ``a short-lived product of the
car industry. A free pony was offered to consumers who purchased
the car.''
   For extra credit, Shutes noted singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, who
gets a mention in the song, was born Duluth and reared in Hibbing.
   The three references he stumbled on were: ``Sugar Ray,'' ``Pope
Paul,'' and ``Santayana.'' He incorrectly identified boxing
champion Sugar Ray Robinson as a baseball player; he confused Pope
Paul VI of Italy with John Paul II, as the first Polish pope, and
misidentified philospher George Santayana as the 1960s rock band
Santana.

   A woman who alleges she was sexually
assaulted by author Hunter S. Thompson admits she produced X-rated
movies in the 1970s. But she claims not to know where the ``gonzo''
journalist got the idea that she's now in the sex-aids trade.
   Gail M. Palmer-Slater of St. Clair, Mich., alleged she went to
Thompson's Woody Creek home on Feb. 21 to conduct a ``professional
interview'' because she idolized him, she said in an interview
Thursday with the Aspen Times Daily.
   She said when she refused to join him in his hot tub, he
allegedly punched her and grabbed her breast.
   Thompson, the author of ``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign
Trail,'' told the newspaper that Palmer-Slater ``was real drunk,
sloppy drunk'' and pressured him to have sex with her.
   ``I pushed her away from me,'' he said. ``She went backward and
one hand brushed her breast.''
   Thompson, who lives near Aspen, was arrested Monday on sex
assault and simple assault charges, and later freed on $2,000 bond.
He is expected to enter a plea at a March 13 hearing.
   He said Palmer-Slater came to his house to talk about a new
business venture.
   ``She wanted me to help her get publicity for her business,
which is women's lingerie and dildos,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson said he had seen porno videotapes of Slater made in the
mid-1970s, when she was in her 20s. Slater said she was a video and
film producer in the 1970s and that she sometimes appeared in the
productions.
   Jim Holliday, author of ``Only the Best,'' a history of the porn
film industry, said a woman named Gail Palmer produced and directed
porn films in the 1970s, including ``The Erotic Adventures of
Candy'' and ``Candy Goes to Hollywood'' in 1978.
