   Rock survivor Bonnie Raitt, who has toiled in
the vineyards of obscurity since the 1960s, won four Grammy awards
Wednesday, including album of the year, for her critically
acclaimed ``Nick of Time'' album.
   ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' a ballad performed by two-time Grammy
winner Bette Midler, written Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar, won
record of the year and song of the year.
   ``This record's my first No. 1,'' gushed Midler to the audience
at the 32nd annual Grammy Awards show. ``I had to wait 17 years for
it. I hope I don't have to wait another 17.''
   ``I can only take so much of this,'' said Raitt, accepting her
fourth award, female pop vocalist. ``Wake me up when this is over.''
   Raitt also won female rock vocalist and shared the traditional
blues award with John Lee Hooker for ``I'm in the Mood'' on
Hooker's ``The Healer'' album.
   ``This means so much for the kind of music I do, and means those
of us who do rhythm and blues are going to get a chance again,''
said Raitt, 40, a four-time nominee.
   It was a night for survivors.
   Don Henley, formerly of the Eagles, won male rock vocalist for
his lyrical, melancholy ``The End of the Innocence.'' Henley,
co-wrote the album's title track with Bruce Hornsby. It was his
sixth career Grammy.
   ``Great. You sing a song, you win an award,'' a smiling Henley
said, accepting his award moments after performing the tune with
Hornsby.
   Blue-eyed soul balladeer Michael Bolton won best male pop
vocalist Grammy for ``How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.''
   Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville won pop duo honors for their
love duet ``Don't Know Much.'' Their producer, Peter Asher, who
began his career in the '60s as half of the Peter &amp; Gordon duo, was
named producer of the year.
   Bolton, who has been recording since the '70s, acknowledged his
``overnight success'' and thanked ``Ray Charles for blessing us all
and opening his mouth and singing.''
   Ronstadt thanked Neville's mother: ``She gave us not only Aaron,
but all the Neville Brothers and that's a pretty great musical
contribution.'' Neville had his first Top 10 hit in 1966 with
``Tell It Like It Is.'' Ronstadt first made the charts with the
Stone Poneys in ``Different Drum'' in 1968.
   The first televised Grammy award in the rap music category went
to Young MC for the single ``Bust a Move.'' Last year the miniature
gramophone trophy for rap was presented off-camera and some rappers
boycotted the ceremony.
   Lyle Lovett won male country vocal honors for ``Lyle Lovett and
His Large Band'' album; k.d. lang won country music's female
vocalist award for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''
   Milli Vanilli, the Munich-based, dredlocked pop duo of Fab
Morvan and Rob Pilatus, won best new artist honors despite the
``hip-hopping radio fodder'' label given them by Rolling Stone
magazine.
   Slick rhythm and blues group Soul II Soul, legendary jazz artist
Miles Davis and jazz composer-arranger Dave Grusin were early
multiple winners in pre-broadcast ceremonies at the Shrine
Auditorium.
   Soul II Soul won the rhythm and blues group performance for the
single ``Back to Life,'' and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for the
``African Dance'' track from their ``Keep on Movin' '' album.
   Davis, already recipient of a lifetime achievement award from
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, won best jazz
solo instrumental for ``Aura'' and won for the same album in the
big band jazz instrumental category.
   Grusin won three Grammys, for the background score of the movie
``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' instrumental arrangement for the suite
from ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' and arrangement with vocals for
the ``My Funny Valentine'' track from ```Baker Boys.''
   The all-star collaboration of The Traveling Wilburys won the
rock vocal group Grammy, ending the Rolling Stones' latest bid for
a first Grammy.
   Brother and sister Michael and Janet Jackson won back-to-back
music video trophies. Michael won the short form Grammy for his
``Leave Me Alone'' and Janet claimed the long form category for
``Rhythm Nation 1814.''
   Bobby Brown won as best rhythm and blues male vocalist for his
``Every Little Step'' single; and female R&amp;B vocalist honors went
to Anita Baker for ``Giving You the Best That I've Got.''
   In the classical categories, Leonard Bernstein and the New York
Philharmonic won best orchestral performance for ``Mahler: Symphony
No. 3 in D Minor,'' and cellist Yo-Yo Ma won the instrumental
soloist award for ``Barber: Cello Concerto, Op. 22-Britten Symphony
for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 68.''
   The late Gilda Radner won the best spoken word Grammy for her
album ``It's Always Something.''
   ``After All This Time'' was named best country song, earning a
Grammy for singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell.
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Davis were chosen for the
Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and Dick Clark received a
Trustees Award, for achievements in the non-performing side of the
industry.

   The Academy also gave two posthumous Lifetime Achievement Awards
to singer Nat ``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   The achievement awards recognize performers who have made
contributions of outstanding artistic significance. Earlier
recipients have included the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Bing
Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Arturo Toscanini.
   Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of
the academy, a non-profit organization formed to represent all
segments of the recording industry.
   The Grammy Awards began in 1958 with 28 categories, since
increased to nearly 80.
