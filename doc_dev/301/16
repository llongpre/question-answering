   Actor-comedian Chevy Chase, who is reprising his
role as the dedicated family man in ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,'' says he thinks about going out with the guys as a break
from an all-female household.
   Chase said living with his wife, Jane, and three daughters has
changed his life, but he also feels ``out of control of my life
now.''
   ``I think I need to be taken away, dropped in some territory
with just a lot of loud guys,'' he said in an interview scheduled
for broadcast today and Friday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Like just get Danny Aykroyd and Marty (Martin Short) and (Tom)
Hanks and a bunch of us and just put us all together and leave us
alone with a 'fridge full of beer or something.''
   Chase, who has played the goofy family patriarch Clark Griswold
in two previous ``Vacation'' movies, said being a real-life father
means having responsibilities to his children.
   ``So, there are many things that I don't do that I used to do,''
he said. ``For instance, I sleep in a nightgown now.'

   Talk show host Dick Cavett needed 35
tries to get it right while making a videotape to promote West
Virginia.
   But give him break: He was doing it in Japanese.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton, scheduled to go to Japan Dec. 2 for a
nine-day visit, will take with him the promotional videotape in
which Cavett extols the state's virtues.
   ``We in America are quite proud of West Virginia,'' the
translated text of Cavett's remarks show. Cavett says Japan and
West Virginia have mountain ranges, a proud history and eyes on the
future.
   The governor's office said Cavett has done three documentaries
for Japanese television.
   Cavett is the latest celebrity to promote West Virginia. Actor
Leslie Nielsen, star of ``Airplane'' and ``The Naked Gun,'' has
done a package promoting education in the state.

   Jean-Paul Kauffmann has won the ``Relais Gourmand''
literary prize for a book of essays on wine, ``Le Bordeaux
Retrouve,'' which he dedicated to fellow Beirut hostage Michel
Seurat, who died in captivity.
   Kauffmann, who received the award Wednesday, was freed in May
1988 after spending more than three years in captivity. While held,
he promised to swear off wine for one year if released.
   He kept his promise.
   The book is about his rediscovery of wine.
   The book, whose title means rediscovering Bordeaux, is not for
sale. The 2,400 copies are to be distributed to the best customers
of the 105 ``relais gourmands'' (gourmet restaurants) worldwide.

   Dick Clark, America's oldest teen-ager,
turned 60 today but with little fanfare or fuss.
   He planned to blow out the candles on a birthday cake with his
wife, Kari, and another couple somewhere in Brazil, publicist Paul
Shefrin said.
   Clark turned down an interview request. In the past, the
multimillion-dollar entertainer-producer said he would prefer to
``age gracefully'' without media attention.
   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but for decades
his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once compared the
burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets
to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go.
It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.
   Clark arrived in the nation's living rooms through his
``American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to
Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Madonna, as well as the Bunny Hop,
Twist and Jerk dance crazes.

   John Palmer, who in September was replaced as
``Today'' show newscaster by Deborah Norville, is leaving NBC News
after 26 years.
   Palmer and an NBC News spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday
on a report that he is calling it quits at the network.
   But an NBC executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Palmer is leaving.
   ``Media Beat,'' shown on CNBC, the NBC-owned cable channel,
reported that Palmer is going to work with Av Westin, a former ABC
News program executive, on a new series for King World Productions,
syndicator of ``Wheel of Fortune.''
   Palmer joined NBC News in 1963 from station WSB-TV in Atlanta.
   He later became a White House correspondent. In September, after
seven years with ``Today,'' he moved to ``NBC News at Sunrise.''
