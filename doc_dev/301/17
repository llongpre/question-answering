   Profanities uttered by the heavy metal band
Guns N' Roses were heard by millions of TV viewers tuned in to the
American Music Awards and brought a barrage of complaints and an
apology from ABC.
   ``As a policy we can't discuss specific numbers, but I can
acknowledge that we have received many calls during the telecast
and this morning protesting the fact that the program contained
offensive language,'' network spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said
this morning from New York.
   Guns N' Roses, with a reputation for raunchy behavior, won two
awards during the Monday night ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium,
one as favorite heavy metal group and the other for best heavy
metal album, ``Appetite for Destruction.''
   The band was cut off in mid-sentence while accepting its first
award when guitarist Slash used a profanity.
   Slash and fellow band member Duff ``Rose'' McKagan stumbled to
stage and draped themselves over the speaker's stand to accept the
second award. They were quickly cut off when they began using
profanities again.
   The three-hour telecast was shown live in the East. The
offensive language was edited out of the tape-delayed West Coast
version.
   ``We regret that last night's telecast of American Music Awards
contained some offensive language,'' Gretemeyer said. ``This has
not happened before in the 17 years that the awards show has been
on the air and we will take precautionary measures to see that it
will not happen in future telecasts.''
   ABC may use a seven-second delay in the future, she said.
   A receptionist at Geffen Records, the band's label, said
telephone lines were jammed at the company's Sunset Boulevard
offices and no one was available for comment.
   ``Live programming leads to spontaneous occurrences and
unfortunately last night's was regrettable,'' Dick Clark, producer
of the show, said in a statement. ``We will take all steps possible
toward preventing a recurrence.''
   Paul Shefrin, a publicist for Clark, said Clark's office had
received numerous calls complaining about the language, but he
couldn't determine how many.
   Five months ago, dick clark productions was victimized by
comedian Andrw Dice Clay when he used a profanity on the MTV Video
Music Awards. The Sept. 6 show was also televised live nationwide
on cable's music channel.
   MTV officials announced afterward that the comic was banned for
life from the cable channel.
   Guns N' Roses has offended before.
   Last year, the sponsors of an AIDS benefit concert in New York
dropped the band from the lineup because of anti-homosexual lyrics
on some of their songs. Among the songs deemed objectionable was
``One in a Million,'' which uses a degrading term for homosexuals
and implies they spread the disease.
   In October, lead singer Axl Rose told a Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum audience he was quitting the band because of excessive
drug use in the group. ``I just didn't want to see my friends slip
away,'' said Rose.
   He later apologized and said he wasn't leaving the group.
