   Nickelodeon's ``Nick at Nite'' service knows
its audience is the TV generation, so it will expand its lineup
this fall to include more old comedies and a new but old-style
cartoon series from animator Ralph Bakshi.
   ``The Patty Duke Show'' comes to the cable channel's night-time
lineup of nostalgia, which already includes such classics as ``Mr.
Ed,'' ``My Three Sons,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and ``Make Room
for Daddy.''
   Nickelodeon is also adding two more contemporary comedy
showcases. Beginning Sept. 12, viewers can see ``The Best of
`Saturday Night Live'' and ``SCTV'' back-to-back nightly, 10-11
p.m. EDT.
   ```Nick at Nite' is targeting the new American family. Our
demographics tell us that both kids and their parents are watching.
We're not sure who is dragging whom to the set _ the mom who loves
`Donna' and remembers it or the kid who just discovered `Mr. Ed,'
'' Nickelodeon Vice President Linda Kahn told a meeting of
television critics.
   ``We've decided we've become a Museum of Broadcasting with a
beer and a fridge thrown in for good measure,'' she said.
   Bakshi, who also appeared at the presentation to TV critics,
said his half-hour cartoon ``Tattertown'' would be an homage to the
old-style animation of the 1920s and '30s.
   The series is set in a village inhabited by cartoon characters.
   ``We'll have characters sitting in bars or in parks wondering
why didn't they make it; they could have been as big as Mickey, but
they didn't have an organization behind them,'' Bakshi said. The
concept sounds something like the wildly successful feature-length
animated film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' which is set in 'Toon
Town.
   Bakshi said he created the concept for ``Tattertown'' back in
high school, but added, ``if it does sound like it (`Roger
Rabbit'), that's fine.'' For ``Tattertown,'' Bakshi said he will
create new characters, where ``Roger Rabbit'' featured cameos by
already famous cartoon characters.
   Bakshi didn't escape questions about his network cartoon show,
``Mighty Mouse,'' and the charge by conservative media critic Rev.
Donald Wildmon that Mighty Mouse snorted cocaine in one episode.
Bakshi said the mouse was sniffing flower petals, but later cut
those seconds from the episode to quiet the controversy.
   ``When an adult makes a statement enough times, the kids are
going to believe it, and I didn't want it to become an issues at
school _ did he or didn't he?'' said Bakshi, adding he has a
10-year-old son. He said if it had been an adult cartoon, he would
have resisted any changes, but in this case, ``my first concern was
with the kids.''
   ``Nick at Nite'' will also have its own satirical news show,
``Global Village,'' which boasts a similarly satirical promo, a
takeoff on the currently popular up-close, cinema verite
commercials. The ``Global Village'' motto is, ``If we don't cover
it, it doesn't matter.''
   As far day-time Nickelodeon, which features kids' programming,
the cable channel plans to add the new show ``Kids Court,'' in
which kids decide such issues as whether to turn in a friend for
cheating on a test, and who should have to fix a broken portable
stereo.
   There's also ``Eureka's Castle,'' a show aimed at pre-schoolers'
problems, such as being afraid of the dark or having to make a
telephone call. Kids will also get to vote in a Nickelodeon poll on
who should be president after a series of reports on the campaign
by a kid reporter. Nickelodeon announced it is developing a kids'
news show, but it will probably be a few years before it gets on
the air.
   MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon, also announced some
changes for its music video channel VH-1. That channel, aimed at
older viewers, is going this fall to a half-hour format rather than
radio-like continuous music. Each half hour, viewers will get an
entertainment news update, a video, a comedy short, another video,
then a ``time capsule'' look back at a moment in history before the
half hour concludes with more videos.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MTV DISCOVERS DICK CLARK _ Music television veteran Dick Clark
will produce the ``1988 MTV Video Music Awards,'' to be broadcast
live from Los Angeles on Sept. 7. Arsenio Hall will be co-host. The
other co-host will be announced later, MTV officials said. ``Our
purpose is not to change that little off-center feel that MTV
brings to all of their work, but to organize and bring it in
hopefully on time,'' said Clark, who launched ``American
Bandstand'' in 1952. ...
   SPEAKING OF AWARDS SHOWS _ ``Saturday Night Live'' executive
producer Lorne Michaels plans, not surprisingly, to introduce a
note of comedy into the Emmy Awards show which he is producing for
the first time this year. The show airs Aug. 28. Michaels says
since it's the 40th anniversary of the awards, the show will
feature montages of shows with similar themes, such as how a
problem might have been solved in family sitcoms, dating from
``Father Knows Best'' to ``Growing Pains.'' Also as a note of
nostalgia, Michaels plans to put a band on stage _ probably
including SNL bandleader G.E. Smith _ and bring back the phrase,
``May I have the envelope please?''
