Television toasts New Year's Eve and the dawn of a new decade with a minimum of 
noise and a maximum of merriment Sunday night.

<P>
At 11:30 p.m. Sunday, the late-night revelry abounds in a three-way 
free-for-all.

blowouts at the Waldorf-Astoria and Times Square in New York as well as Billy 
Bob's honky-tonk in Ft. Worth, Tex. Hosted by Natalie Cole, the two-hour show's 
performers include Melissa Manchester, Tanya Tucker, Charlie Daniels and Gary 
Morris.

ABC counters with "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve '90" on (7)(3)(10)(42). 
Braving the cold of Manhattan, Clark ticks off the final seconds of 1989 at his 
customary post in wild 'n' crazy Times Square. Back in Hollywood, Kirk Cameron 
and Lori Laughlin co-host an in-studio bash with pop music stars Michael 
Damian, Expose, Martika, Stephanie Mills and the Temptations.
