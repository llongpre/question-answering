   At Least This Cause Would Taste
   As Sweet in Defeat as in Victory

   As campus crusades go, it will never be the rallying cry
of a generation. But some college students have become
fervent confectionery objectors.
   Several students at Clark University are on a mission to
save their chocolate namesake, the Clark bar. With its bright
red-and-blue packaging and crunchy blend of peanut butter,
nuts and chocolate, the 105-year-old bar has been a venerable
survivor of the candy-counter wars.

   But last year, the Clark bar's owner, the Leaf Inc. unit
of Huhtamaki Oy, of Finland, announced it would close the
candy's manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh if a buyer couldn't
be found. Leaf tried to turn the once-profitable regional
confection into a national brand when the candy industry
consolidated in the 1980s, only to find it lacked the
marketing clout of better-financed rivals.
   When news of the sweet's impending demise reached Clark
University in Worcester, Mass., the great candy crusade
began. After all, the school hands out bars to students as
part of a survival kit during final-exam week, and a campus
singing group is named the Clark Bars.
   Spearheading the campaign was Jennifer Leone, a
21-year-old senior who concedes that not all students were
moved by the cause. "I remember one girl started laughing
when I asked her to sign a petition to save the Clark bar,"
she says.
   The bar enthusiasts used the campaign to raise money for
the American Cancer Society. (A Clark student died of cancer
last year.) They sought out natural allies, checking Who's
Who and writing letters to 203 Clarks, including television
personality Dick Clark. The students also sent notes to
dozens of Clarks in the Worcester area.
   The missives alerted the Clarks that their bar was
endangered, and also requested a contribution for cancer
research. Dick Clark didn't respond, but dozens of other
Clarks did, including a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark.
   "He said he was proud to be part of the Clark family," Ms.
Leone says. She sent him 10 bars.
   The students raised $3,500, including a $1,000
contribution from Leaf. Jim Hanlon, chief executive officer
of Leaf North America, says no buyer for the Clark bar has
been found. He won't say how much longer the company will
wait before shutting the plant, but calls the response to the
campaign heartening. He notes: "It shows that the bar has
vitality."
