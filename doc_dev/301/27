<LEADPARA>  NOT SO long ago, the market for old TV musical specials was virtually
non-existent. ABC, CBS and NBC seldom re-ran them, and there was no secondary
market for them.;    So, mostly they gathered dust on warehouse shelves or,
worse yet, were simply forgotten for so long that they were considered lost.  </LEADPARA>

(box) FRANK SINATRA: THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC
Tonight at 9 p.m., Disney Channel  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There was a reason for the low value accorded vintage TV music shows by the
commercial broadcast networks: They depend on attracting a mass audience to
justify the huge costs charged for advertising spots, and nobody expects a
mass audience to tune in for yesterday's out-of-date music.;    But all that
is changing, thanks to the growth of cable television and the home-video
market, where it's standard practice to market entertainment to much more
specialized tastes.;    Example: Tonight's revival of the 1981 TV special
"Frank Sinatra: The Man and His Music," on the Disney Channel, a pay-cable
network. It's not being hidden away in the wee hours of the morning, but
begins at 9 p.m., the heart of prime time.;    The Sinatra show, which
features the legendary singer in concert with another legend, the late Count
Basie and his orchestra, is one of 13 Sinatra TV specials the Disney Channel
has been featuring in its "Sunday Night Showcase" series.;    These old
Sinatra shows not only are getting a major revival on one of America's most
popular cable networks, but also are becoming available in boxed sets of three
on the home-video market, where they're sold to hard-core Sinatra fans at
about $70 a pop.;    Naturally, long-running superstars of Sinatra's stature
are the kind whose earlier TV specials are most in demand. The Disney Channel
already has revived several Elvis Presley specials and has been running early
Judy Garland TV shows.;    Such programs are especially attractive to the
folks at Disney, who market their service to a mixed audience of youngsters
and older adults. They don't sell advertising, so there's no need to guarantee
anybody a huge rating for each show.;    Instead, pay networks such as Disney
are mainly interested in satisfying subscribers by appealing directly to their
tastes. Obviously, Disney research shows there's a demand for these old
musical shows, or they wouldn't be scheduling them so often.;    There's also
a brisk business in recycling vintage TV appearances by rock-and-roll stars of
the 1950s and '60s. Dick Clark, who controls perhaps the largest library of
vintage rock tapes and TV clips, markets his material so cannily that dust
never has time to collect. ABC already has ordered a 40th anniversary
"American Bandstand" special from Clark for next season, which will make heavy
use of Clark's library.;    The recent revival of the 15-minute and half-hour
Nat "King" Cole musical shows from the early 1950s on PBS stations may signal
yet another market for TV musical programs that generally were considered
arcane fare for the dust bin.;    In the meantime, tonight's Sinatra/Basie
concert on Disney is a rare treat for anybody who enjoys pop music with an
authentic jazz flavor, from the opener, "Nice and Easy," to "Thanks for the
Memory," which closes the show.;    The thought of shows like this just
sitting on a shelf for decades at a time is almost too much to bear. Thanks to
the emerging new markets for them, that may no longer be their ultimate fate.  </TEXT>
