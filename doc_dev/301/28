Dick Clark has kept the company of millions during his 43 years in broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
But he always plays to an audience of one. 
</P>
<P>
"I visualize in my mind, I learned this from my idols of years ago, that 
there's only one person listening or watching and you direct yourself to that 
person," Clark said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a secret that Arthur Godfrey knew very well, Garry Moore knew very well 
-- the pioneers learned that lesson years ago." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clark was counted among the pioneers. He accepted membership in 
the Emerson Radio Hall of Fame along with Charles Osgood, Paul Harvey, Harry 
Caray, Bob Hope and Frank Stanton.
