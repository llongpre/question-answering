   Dick Clark, the boyish Pied Piper of rock
'n' roll known to generations as America's oldest teen-ager, turns
60 Thursday secluded on another continent far away from the
enamored masses.
   The squeaky-clean packager of pop will blow out the candles on a
birthday cake with his wife, Kari, and another couple somewhere in
Brazil, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
   No fanfare. No party. No fuss.
   Whether because of modesty or vanity, Clark turned down an
interview request. In the past, the multimillion-dollar
entertainer-producer said he would prefer to ``age gracefully''
without media attention.
   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but it's hard
to believe he's 60.
   For decades, his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets
to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go.
It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.
   Clark arrived in the nation's living rooms through his
``American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to
Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Madonna, as well as the Bunny Hop,
Twist and Jerk dance crazes.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the airwaves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But Clark became its symbol when he took it over in 1956, and
generations of teen-agers came to identify with the clean-cut,
carefully suited and coiffed host. He was a friendly, hip father
figure.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC-TV
network, quickly becoming a national success. Jerry Lee Lewis'
``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' was the first record spun on that
show.
   In March, Clark hung up his saddle shoes after 33 years as host
of ``American Bandstand.'' The show reigns as television's
longest-lived variety program.
   Clark lives on the beach near Paradise Cove, behind an imposing
iron gate across a driveway that winds down from Pacific Coast
Highway.
   He was born at the onset of the Great Depression, when the Big
Band era started to flourish.
   Clark joins other celebrity sexagenarians this year _ Jacqueline
Onassis, Bob Newhart, Audrey Hepburn, June Carter Cash, Buck Owens,
Ed Asner, Berry Gordy, Adam West, Jules Feiffer, Jean Simmons and
Arnold Palmer.
   Clark was unique, however, in transcending the generations with
a hip music show and, in recent years, as host of the ``$25,000
Pyramid'' and ``$100,000 Pyramid'' game shows.
   He also produces the annual American Music Awards, the Academy
of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' TV bash and
``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''
