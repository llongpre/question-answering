<LEADPARA>  MANY critics, including this one, predicted cable's ACE awards would wither
and die once the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences let cable programs
compete for Emmys.;    Well, that happened a couple of years ago and the ACE
awards still are going strong, celebrating their 12th anniversary tonight with
the televised presentation of their honors for 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Unlike the Emmys, which are telecast by one broadcast network (currently
Fox) while the other three all counter-program fiercely, the ACES are telecast
simultaneously on eight different cable networks, so the winners will get the
maximum exposure to viewers.;    The live 6 p.m. telecast from the Wiltern
theater in Los Angeles will be carried by Black Entertainment Television
(BET), The Discovery Channel, The Family Channel, HA!, Lifetime, Nick at Nite,
TBS and TNT.;    That spirit of cooperation is what the ACE awards are all
about. The cable networks see the show boosting their industry by reminding
viewers how much good stuff is now available only on cable.;    Why do the
ACEs still exist when the same shows now can win more prestigious Emmys?
Here's an educated guess: Cable folks love awards just as much as broadcast
people, but the TV Academy just doesn't give them enough.;    If you watch
tonight's ACE telecast, you'll see nothing but cable awards. The National
Academy of Cable Programming, which makes the awards, doesn't engage in the
sort of tokenism that has characterized cable's modest showing at the Emmys so
far.;    You might also see an entertaining show, produced by Dick Clark,
hosted by actor James Woods and featuring such celebrity names as James Earl
Jones, Bob Saget, Debbie Reynolds, Leonard Nimoy, Blair Brown and many more.;
