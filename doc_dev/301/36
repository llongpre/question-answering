   It is nice to be 82 and still a working
journalist. But Alistair Cooke, who is both, reports one problem
when young reporters arrive to interview him:
   ``I am at the stage where I ask, `Does the name Adolf Hitler
mean anything to you?'''
   Despite this gentle reminder that those who forget history are
doomed to see it repeated on cable, Cooke has prevailed in
broadcasting and will take due note of it early in the new year -
on Jan. 13, to be precise.
   He'll celebrate his 20th anniversary then as host of PBS'
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' commencing a nine-week retrospective of
some of its better-known dramatic bundles from Britain. But of
course they include ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' ``I, Claudius,'' and
``The Jewel in the Crown.''
   If that's not enough, PBS will offer a Jan. 24 parody of the
series, ``Masterpiece Tonight,'' concocted by Gerard Alessandrini,
whose ``Forbidden Broadway'' here regularly applies the needle to
Broadway musicals.
   A transplanted Englishman who gives urbane a good name, Cooke
has been the only host of ``Masterpiece Theatre'' since it began on
Jan. 10, 1971 with ``The First Churchills'' - one of his
least-favorite shows, incidentally.
   An elegant man, he favors blue blazers, gray slacks, and the
graceful turn of phrase. Also jazz piano.
   Born in Manchester, and a U.S. citizen since 1941, he first came
here as a student in 1932. He returned as a man of print and
broadcast who since 1938 has tried to explain America to the
British, no mean feat.
   In 1970, he embarked upon an even more difficult feat -
explaining America to the Americans - in his acclaimed ``America''
series, a BBC co-production that NBC aired in prime time in
1972-73. The show won four Emmies.
   But it also almost prevented him from signing up for
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' He was in Boston, filming the third
``America'' episode, when accosted by a young British producer,
Christopher Sarson.
   The ``Masterpiece'' idea - hosting a weekly series of British
dramas adapted from famous novels - was explained. Cooke begged
off, saying he'd be tied up on ``America'' for two years and
constantly travelling.
   But Sarson ``was a deadpan scoundrel - and terrifically
persuasive,'' he said.
   A veteran America-watcher whose dossier of pals and influences
includes H.L. Mencken, Cooke will celebrate another milestone in
March.
   That will be his 45th anniversary of commenting on his adopted
country's wild and sometimes disturbing ways in ``Letter From
America,'' a 14-minute weekly report he delivers on radio for the
BBC.
   Heard via short-wave in 52 countries, including this one, he
likens what he calls ``my talks'' to ``a diary, in a way, written
for a friend.''
   He comments on whatever strikes his fancy, sad or funny, minute
or of great import and consequence (he does admit, gently laughing,
that he has yet to give the once-over to Madonna and her amazing
mondo video).
   It's his proud semiboast that in all the years of ``Letter'' he
hasn't missed a week, although ``we came damn close a few months
ago'' when he had to go to a hospital here for a prostate
operation.
   Arrangements were made for him to tape that week's show in the
hospital's boardroom. They rolled him there in a wheelchair,
accompanied by two public relations officials, ``both stunning,''
from the hospital.
   He recalls telling them, ``What a pity we didn't have a
photographer with us. It's the first time in 44 years that I've
broadcast with a catheter bag.''
   As befits a man of his years and travels, he occasionally is
asked to compare the America of, say, 1940, with the America of
today. Given the chance to go cosmic, he instead offers a
refreshing, unexpected answer.
   ``I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``The standard thing is to talk
about the loss of innocence. Every generation thinks it was
innocent when it was young. It wasn't innocent. It was young.''
   He smiles when asked when, if ever, he'll sign off the air and
retire.
   ``Oh, it may happen tomorrow. I live from day to day, and it's
not for me to decide that. But I don't have any intention of doing
that. I think when you retire, you keel over.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT, IT'S FOR A DARN GOOD REASON:
The usual New Year's shows are loose on the networks starting at
11:30 p.m. EST tonight. CBS has ``Happy New Year America, 1991,''
hosted by Melissa Manchester and featuring Terry Bradshaw in Times
Square. That's where NBC's Jane Pauley also will be as part of a
live ``Tonight'' guest-hosted by Jay Leno. Yet another star, Dick
Clark, is checking in from Times Square for ``Dick Clark's New
Year's Rockin' Eve '91.''
