Happy Birthday, In Stereo: the Walkman, the personal music machine that started 
us wearing those funny little headphones, is 10 years old, and to celebrate the 
occasion, Sony, the manufacturer, and the Hard Rock Cafe will host 
invitation-only parties Nov. 8 at Hard Rocks in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, 
Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. The celebrity-studded gala in New York -- 
hosted by Dick Clark and featuring comedian Robert Klein and Paul Shaffer and 
his World's Most Dangerous Band -- will be beamed by satellite to the other 
parties, where guests reportedly will be able to hear the goings-on without 
headphones. ALEENE MacMINN
