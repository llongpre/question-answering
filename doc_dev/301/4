   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll Pied Piper whose
``American Bandstand'' introduced teen-agers to Stevie Wonder, The
Jackson 5 and Madonna as well as the Bunny Hop, Twist and Jerk dance
crazes, is hanging up his saddle shoes after 33 years.
   Known to generations of youths as America's oldest teen-ager, the
squeaky-clean packager of pop next month turns over the emcee chores
of television's longest running variety program to David Hirsch.
   ``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a
chance,'' Clark, 59, said in a statement.
   ``I knew that this day would evenutally come. I've been very
forutnate to host Bandstand as long as I have,'' he continued.
```American Bandstand' has always been like a fourth child to me _ a
child that has grown and matured.''
   Interview requests were declined. ``He is trying to make it nice
and quiet without hoopla,'' Clark spokesman Tom Stepanchak said
Wednesday.
   Hirsch takes over April 8 when the syndicated show moves to USA
Network. The Detroit native, who lives in Los Angeles, also will
continue to work for Clark's production company as a producer for
``USA's CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network.
   ``I was completely flattered and honored to be asked to audition.
I was extremely nervous,'' Hirsch said in quotes provided by
Stephanchak. ``When they told me I was the new host, I was
speechless. It was a total shock.''
   Hirsch, who was unavailable for interviews Wednesday because of
an unspecified family emergency, is a graduate of Michigan State
University. He has worked with improvisational comedy groups, worked
as a disc jockey in college and played drums in several bands to
help pay his way through school.
   Clark won't be retiring to his Malibu beach house to watch gulls
and migrating whales. ``American Bandstand'' is only a small part of
his production empire.
   He continues as TV host of the ``$25,000 Pyramid'' and ``$100,000
Pyramid'' game shows, numerous television movies and network
specials. He is the producer of the annual American Music Awards,
the Academy of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve''
TV show and ``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, debuted in September 1952
on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee Stewart as hosts.
Clark took over in 1956. He became the show's symbol as it won five
Emmy awards and made him a multimillionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' moved to the ABC network,
quickly becoming a national success. The first record spun on that
show was ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' by Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``The first record of the day was always a fast one. It got the
kids moving,'' said Clark.
   On his Thanksgiving show on Nov. 22, 1957, Clark introduced the
singing duo Tom &amp; Jerry, who sang ``Hey Schoolgirl.'' The duet later
recorded under their real names, Simon &amp; Garfunkel.
   Over the years, more than 65,000 records were played on
``American Bandstand.'' The show has logged more than 10,000 musical
guest appearances and more than 600,000 teen-agers have danced
before television cameras.
   Generations of teens saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of jokes for
maintaining his boyish looks, and once compared the burden to that
of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to
be a drag after a while, because someday the looks have gotta go,''
he said. ``It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully.''
   Off-screen, Clark has acknowledged he has a temper and is
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates. But in his ``Bandstand''
persona, teens saw him as a friendly, hip father figure.
   The show was a must for many performers. It provided the first
national exposure for Madonna, the Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, James
Brown, Neil Diamond, Bobby Darin, Tina Turner, Buddy Holly and The
Doors.
   Others making nationwide debuts on the show included Chubby
Checker, Sonny &amp; Cher, Barry Manilow, Prince, Pat Benatar, Sheena
Easton, Cyndi Lauper, The Four Tops, Billy Idol, Gladys Knight &amp; The
Pips, Wham! and Bon Jovi.
   ``American Bandstand'' also launched songs onto the best-seller
charts and introduced America to such dances as the Twist, Swing,
Jerk, Bunny Hop, Pogo, Hustle, Bus Stop and break dancing.
