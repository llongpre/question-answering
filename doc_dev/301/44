   Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon recently
celebrated the 26th anniversary of ``The Tonight Show,'' but their
association goes back four more years.
   It was 30 years ago when they started working together, when
Carson was host of a game show called ``Who Do You Trust?'' and
McMahon was hired to be the announcer.
   ``Our relationship was established the very first day,'' McMahon
recalled. ``I introduced the show, then I brought him the list of
questions. He jumped and said, `Lothar, you startled me!'
   Lothar was the faithful sidekick to ``Mandrake the Magician'' in
the newspaper comic strip. When Mandrake's magic wasn't enough,
Lothar supplied the muscle.
   ``That set our relationship. Lots of humor and kidding. A lot of
playing on my size, being a happy-go-lucky Irishman. All the things
we've done on `The Tonight Show' were set up and tested on `Who Do
You Trust?'
   ``Johnny's the boss,'' said McMahon. ``You have to remember
that, but I get my two cents' worth in there. His many marriages _
it's always good for a joke. His wealth and his passion for
privacy. Actually, Johnny kids himself. He'll say, `Somebody came
to see me, but they got wet when they fell into the moat.'''
   Their association has lasted longer than any of Carson's
marriages.
   ``We've never had a disagreement, never had a problem,'' said
McMahon. ``I think we have a mutual respect for each other. I
respect his being the boss. I respect his privacy. We like each
other.''
   It was Dick Clark who brought them together, and many years
later, McMahon and Clark teamed up for NBC's ``Bloopers and
Practical Jokes,'' which they still do occasionally as a special.
   ``Dick was my next-door neighbor in Philadelphia,'' McMahon
recalled. ``One day Edward R. Murrow interviewed Dick on the CBS
show `Person to Person.' He had a party, and I entertained. Dick's
producer told me I was pretty good. The producer's office was in
New York in the next office to Johnny's at the Little Theater. When
he heard they were looking for an announcer he suggested me.''
   McMahon took the train to New York and met with Carson. ``He
asked me a few questions and we stood by the window and watched
them put up a sign at the Shubert Theater across the street,'' he
said. ``It was for Judy Holliday in `Bells are Ringing.'
   ``Johnny said thank you, and I left figuring I didn't get the
job. Two weeks later the producer called me and said, `Look, when
you start Monday, wear a suit. Johnny likes to wear sports
clothes.' I said I didn't know what he was talking about. He said,
`Didn't anybody tell you? You got the job.'''
   Prior to becoming Carson's inseparable sidekick, McMahon worked
as an announcer in Philadelphia. He had been host of ``Bride and
Groom'' for six weeks and done a few commercials. Since then, of
course, he has become one of the most active personalities in
commercials. He is also the host of the syndicated talent show
``Star Search.''
   One of his commercial accounts is American Family Publishers,
which mails millions of sweepstakes entries every year. Hallmark is
bringing out a new card which says, ``Why don't I hear from you
anymore?'' Open the card and it says, ``Ed McMahon has time to
write to me.''
   His daughter, Katherine Mary, got a sweepstakes entry when she
was 6 months old.
   McMahon and his wife, Victoria, adopted Katherine Mary nearly
three years ago. He has four grown children.
   In World War II he was a Marine fighter pilot, teaching carrier
landings at Green Cove Springs, Fla. He got his orders to join an
all-Marine group on an aircraft carrier on the day Japan
surrendered.
   He was called back into the Marines in the Korean War and flew
an L19 as an artillery spotter. He recently retired from the Marine
Corps Reserve as a colonel.
   Despite his Irish ancestry, McMahon claims descent from a former
premier of France. He says an ancestor was a general in Napoleon's
army and briefly premier in the days when the Irish frequently
joined the French to fight the English. He has a picture of himself
and his wife standing by the street sign for McMahon Boulevard, one
of the streets radiating from the Arch of Triumph in Paris.
