<LEADPARA>  Dick Clark shows us the famous hands he had just pressed into wet concrete

in Smogville. This concrete honor is afforded only to those who have made
significant contributions to rock music. One proof of Clark's significance is
standing behind him in this shot. It's Fabian, one of Clark's discoveries.  </LEADPARA>
