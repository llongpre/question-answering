   Gentle country crooner Randy Travis and
stylish crossover singer George Michael dominated the American Music
Awards, where heavy metal rowdiness and rap jive earned only limited
acceptance.
   The Shrine Auditorium nationally televised ceremonies Monday
night ushered in first-time categories for heavy metal and rap,
which enjoy widespread youth culture popularity.
   Michael and Travis each won three trophies and diversity reigned
in the winners list with artists like Whitney Houston, Def Leppard,
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Gladys Knight and Guns N' Roses.
   Def Leppard, who didn't attend the ceremony despite three
nominations, won two trophies for heavy metal music but lost with
Van Halen to Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine in the pop-rock
group category. Guns N' Roses lost to Def Leppard twice in heavy
metal but won for pop-rock single.
   The lethargic performance by the tattooed, long-haired ruffians
Guns N' Roses, who were joined by ex-Eagle Don Henley, contrasted
sharply with the show's other flashy, professional numbers.
   Their bad-boy persona also didn't endear them to show producer
Dick Clark, who was forced to move Rod Stewart's performance ahead
of schedule because Guns N' Roses showed up late.
   Travis was named favorite male country vocalist and won the album
trophy for ``Always &amp; Forever'' and the single award for ``I Told
You So.'' He won in three categories last year for the same album.
   Asked about milking awards twice from the same album, he said
backstage, ``I'm not sure how that happened but I'm glad it did.''
   Unlike Grammy Awards decided by artists and industry insiders,
20,000 ordinary music lovers are the arbiters for American Music
Awards. Because ``Always &amp; Forever'' spanned two calendar years, it
was eligible twice.
   It happened before. Glen Campbell's ``Rhinestone Cowboy'' won in
1976-77, Kenny Rogers' ``The Gambler'' in 1980-81 and the
Rogers-Dolly Parton duet ``Islands in the Stream'' got a two-year
ride in 1984-85.
   Michael, formerly of the group Wham!, was favorite male vocalist
in the pop-rock and the soul-rhythm-and-blues categories. His album
``Faith'' claimed the soul-R&amp;B album award.
   ``A couple of years back when I split the group with Andrew
(Ridgely), I knew I had a tough job ahead of me and I thought that
maybe people weren't going to give me much of a chance,'' Michael
told the audience.
   Miss Houston won the female pop-rock and rhythm-and-blues
vocalist categories, her 10th and 11th American Music Awards, and
Miss Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine's Latin beat got them the
pop-rock group award.
   ``I never expected to win this,'' said Miss Estefan. ``It's
wonderful to be able to cross over to a whole new market and to have
everyone from all walks of life like our music.''
   Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips, who dominated the awards in 1976 with
four trophies, beat out hot new acts New Edition and Salt-N-Pepa for
R&amp;B group honors. Alabama won its seventh consecutive country group
trophy.
   Def Leppard swept the heavy metal category as favorite artist and
for the album ``Hysteria.'' The new rap category went to favorite
artist Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince and his album ``He's The D.J.,
I'm The Rapper.''
   Tracy Chapman, who led Grammy nominations earlier this month with
six, was the favorite new pop-rock artist but did not appear to
claim the trophy.
   The ``Dirty Dancing'' movie soundtrack won favorite pop-rock
album.
   Highlighting the three-hour ABC-TV presentation were tributes to
Michael Jackson and Willie Nelson, who were given non-competitive
trophies for personal achievement. A brief segment also honored
three artists who died last year _ Roy Orbison, Brook Benton and
Andy Gibb.
   ``I would first like to thank God, who makes all things
possible,'' said Jackson.
   Guns N' Roses won best pop-rock single for ``Sweet Child O'
Mine'' and Freddie Jackson's ``Nice 'N' Slow'' took the R&amp;B single
award. The favorite new R&amp;B artist was Al B. Sure!, a Boston native.
   Reba McEntire won favorite female country singer, and Patty
Loveless was favorite new country artist.
   Names of nominees were compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners were selected by a polling of 20,000 people who receive
ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc. The
ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards will be handed out Feb. 22.
