   The rambling, slow speech is the nemesis of
any television awards show. So how did comedian Garry Shandling get
picked to be host of the three-hour CBS telecast of the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards?
   ``Well, you know, I hosted the ACE awards a few years ago, and,
and, and uh, uh, it went well and it really wasn't a problem with
uh, my, my delivery,'' the droll Shandling explains.
   ``It's not, it's really not that slow. You know I'm laid back
but _ I put it more as laid back _ I've never had anyone actually
come up to me and say, `Speak faster,' other than my girlfriend in
the heat of an argument.''
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences will present
its coveted Grammys for the best music of 1989 at the cavernous
Shrine Auditorium on Wednesday.
   Don Henley and his thoughtful ``The End of the Innocence'' album
was nominated for four top awards, leading a host of pop and rock
veterans up for more awards or receiving long-overdue consideration
for Grammys.
   Henley, who has one solo Grammy to his credit and four from his
old days with the Eagles, had his LP nominated for album of the
year and best male rock performance. The title tune is up for
record and song of the year.
   Other nominees include Bette Midler, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Petty,
Billy Joel and Bonnie Raitt, who's looking for the first Grammy in
a distinguished career. Perennial favorite Aretha Franklin could
win her 16th Grammy.
   Prince also was a major nominee, earning four of seven bids
drawn by the ``Batman'' movie soundtrack. Neneh Cherry, Indigo
Girls, Milli Vanilli, Soul II Soul and Tone Loc were nominated as
best new artists of 1989.
   Presentations will be framed by performances of nominees Harolyn
Blackwell, Larry Carlton, Rodney Crowell, Miles Davis, Fine Young
Cannibals, Herbie Hancock, Henley, Billy Joel, k.d. lang, Branford
Marsalis, Aaron Neville, Raitt, Ronstadt and Sting.
   The glitter, glamour and variety will be provided by presenters
including spunky dance queen Paula Abdul, rockers Motley Crue and
Bob Seger, breezy singer Olivia Newton-John and actress Meryl
Streep.
   So what does Shandling figure to do?
   ``I'll do a little opening monologue _ and then I understand
there's going to be some music. From what I understand there's a
lot of music on this particular awards program,'' he said.
   The connection between Shandling, star of ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show,'' and the recording industry seems a bit tenuous.
   ``I made a 45 once,'' he says, conceding: ``I have a little
catching up to do. I still have an eight-track tape system.''
   Shandling will review the award show format and write his own
material. Beyond his haircut and getting plenty of sleep the night
before, he claims no worries about the show.
   ``I guess Guns N' Roses isn't going to be making an acceptance
speech, so that takes some of the risk out,'' he says.
   ``It'll be exciting to meet a lot of the musical stars who will
be there because I've spent quite a lot of money on them. This will
be an opportunity for them to give me some of my cash back. ... I'm
certainly going to hit Paul McCartney up for $200,000.''
   McCartney and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis will receive lifetime
achievement awards. Dick Clark will be presented the Trustees
Award, and posthumous tributes will be paid to pianist-crooner Nat
``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   In all, there were 388 nominees in 77 categories.
