All the cats watched "American Bandstand," Dick Clark's rock 'n' roll 
television show, back when Chuck Berry released "Sweet Little Sixteen" in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
But 31 years later, the stars rock around the clock for video junkies on MTV 
and other music video channels. That's bad news for "Bandstand," which 
disappeared from TV after Oct. 7, when it had its last USA cable network 
airing. The show ultimately will be replaced in the same time slot by a 
look-alike music program, "Dance Party U.S.A.," and a teen-oriented magazine 
show called "Youthquake." 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time since Clark took over "Bandstand" in 1956 that the show has 
been out of production. But though it's an American cultural icon, the show's 
cable cancellation came with a whimper and not a bang. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Clark -- "Bandstand's" host for 33 years -- said the show's not 
dead. He'll try to bring "Bandstand" back on prime-time network TV. Moreover, 
America's oldest teen-ager had already quit hosting the show, which was aired 
only on cable since April and hadn't been seen on ABC-TV, its home for three 
decades, for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the cancellation was symbolic of the times for Dick Clark Productions, 
the Burbank company that produced it. The company badly needs a sitcom or game 
show in regular production to smooth out its history of bumpy earnings caused 
by a reliance on revenues from the periodic musical and comedy specials it 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
When Dick Clark Productions went public early in 1987 and raised $8.2 million, 
the company planned to expand into game shows, sitcoms and dramatic TV. (Clark 
and his wife, Karen, own about 76% of the company.) Then, as now, the plan was 
to keep generating new program ideas until one took off. 
</P>
<P>
"One successful game show, one successful series, and everybody will be happy," 
said Clark in a recent interview. "One will beget another, which will beget 
another." 
</P>
<P>
But since the public offering, revenues have tailed off and profits have 
gyrated. The company's stock still trades at about $6.50 a share -- its 
original offering price. Part of the problem has been a competitive market for 
new TV shows, exacerbated by the continued success of many shows already on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's company has failed to produce a successful series and continues to rely 
largely on specials. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make it on specials alone," said industry analyst Harold Vogel of 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Specials, however, make up most of Dick Clark Productions' schedule -- although 
the company declined to break down its earnings by show. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four 1989-90 season series listed in the company's most recent annual 
report, "American Bandstand" is already off the air, and "Trial by Jury" -- a 
courtroom drama -- may soon follow, said Francis C. La Maina, the company's 
president and chief operating officer. One show, "Dick Clark Presents," aired 
only six times in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
What's left, for the most part, are specials. Some are successful perennials: 
Dick Clark has produced "New Year's Rockin' Eve" for 18 years, the "American 
Music Awards" for 17 years and the "Academy of Country Music Awards" for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But some, like "Farm Aid IV" and "The Ice Stars' Hollywood Revue," have 
appeared only once and have an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
That means the company's creative staff has to reinvent the wheel each year 
just to keep rolling at the same pace. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, it also means that revenues come in fits and spurts, not a steady stream 
-- creating stark quarter-to-quarter contrasts. After a fairly strong fiscal 
year that ended June 30, in which Dick Clark earned $2.6 million on revenue of 
$25.6 million, the company's earnings for the first quarter that ended Sept. 30 
plunged 97% to $14,000 from $435,000 a year earlier, despite a 47% jump in 
revenue to $6.9 million from $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the volatility: in the first quarter last year, the television 
company was producing a couple of series -- including "Bandstand" -- that 
generated respectable profit margins. This year, most of Dick Clark 
Productions' first-quarter revenues came from an expensive made-for-TV movie 
that exceeded its budget, cutting into profits. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dick Clark's bids for a regular series is a game show pilot called "The 
Challengers" -- a quiz show Clark would host. The program would focus on 
up-to-date news and entertainment topics. Buena Vista Television, the 
syndication arm of Walt Disney Co., already has sold the show to at least 10 TV 
stations around the country, according to Buena Vista representative Andi 
Sporkin. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NBC has commissioned Dick Clark and another production company to 
produce a pilot for a revived version of "Let's Make a Deal." 
</P>
<P>
But what's behind Door No. 1 for Dick Clark in game shows could be 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
For one, there's plenty of competition. "It'll be pretty hard, I think, because 
there are many doing the same thing," said Merrill Lynch's Vogel. In fact, 
about 45 game shows are now in development and vying for air time, said 
Sporkin. 
</P>
<P>
Among those, one heavyweight contender will be "Monopoly," a TV version of the 
classic board game, produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises, the company that 
created "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
So Dick Clark is also working on pilot scripts for sitcoms. One would star the 
Motown recording group, The Boys. "The script has gone and it's . . . been 
received well. It looks very good for a pilot," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Another pilot script the company is working on is based on the Judy Blume book 
"Just as Long as We're Together." 
</P>
<P>
Counting on a sitcom or series success has its pitfalls too. For the most part, 
such series are so expensive to write and film that their producers don't 
profit from them until they're sold for rerun syndication. But to make it as a 
rerun, a show has to last three or four years as a first-run series. Meanwhile, 
production costs are up front. 
</P>
<P>
It takes considerable resources to bankroll that kind of gamble. And La Maina 
admits that Dick Clark's bigger rivals are better prepared for the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can compete on the same level," said La Maina. "We can't have 
15 or 20 writers under contract." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's need for a breakthrough, Clark said he had no plans to 
try to match his bigger competitors' spending on a single project to create a 
success. "If anybody wants to criticize us they'd say we've been too 
conservative," said Clark. "But we're not in the business of spending the money 
in a dangerous way. With one or two modest successes, everybody will be very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Clark still has a few other businesses besides Dick Clark Productions. Clark 
and La Maina own Olive Enterprises, which essentially leases to Dick Clark both 
the building that houses the company and the right to use the name "American 
Bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
That right could become important soon. A subsidiary of the production company 
has entered into a deal with an East Coast real estate company to develop an 
American Bandstand Grill restaurant in Miami, and La Maina said he hopes the 
restaurant will become the first of a chain. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make the asset work in different ways," La Maina said of the 
"Bandstand" trademark. Being off the air "may add value to the company because 
it now has legendary status," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A former Utica, N.Y., newsman, Clark started in television production in 1956 
when he took over "Bandstand," a local music program on television in 
Philadelphia. Within a year, ABC brought the show to national television, 
dubbing it "American Bandstand" and giving Clark the boost he needed to start a 
series of businesses, one of which eventually became Dick Clark Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, approaching 60, said he's eager to show that his company can do more 
than specials and musical variety shows. "Absolutely, that's the only reason 
this whole world of entertainment is so fascinating," he said. "It's always new 
challenges. It's a great boon for your head. You never get bored." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he is looking forward to results, too -- to the day when observers 
might look at the company's strategy and say "Gee, aren't they smart." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "Right now you can't say that."
