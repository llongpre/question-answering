   Marc Christian, Rock Hudson's ex-lover, has
filed a $22 million libel suit claiming a book portrayed him as a
psychotic criminal.
   Marc Christian, who won $5.5 million from the Hudson estate a
year ago in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, said in the Superior Court
suit filed Wednesday by celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson that he
was shamed by the book's depiction of him.
   The Tom Clark and Dick Kleiner book ``Rock Hudson, Friend of
Mine,'' released last month, referred to Christian as ``a criminal,
a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an
extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist
and a squatter,'' the suit said.
   In addition to Clark and Kleiner, the suit names New York-based
Pharos Books as defendants. Martha Clarke, a spokeswoman for the
publisher, said today, ``the book speaks for itself'' and that the
company would have no other comment.
   A jury ruled in 1989 that Hudson committed ``outrageous
conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from Christian, his
lover for two years.
