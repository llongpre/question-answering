   Television talkshow host Johnny Carson is selling his Johnny Carson Production Co., said Jim Mahoney, a spokesman for the entertainer. 

   Mr. Mahoney said a sales price hasn't yet been determined, but the trade newspaper Daily Variety reported the company is looking for a minimum bid of $65 million. 

   One industry source, however, suggested that $65 million is too steep a price, given the assets of the closely held Los Angeles-based concern. 

   The assets include syndication interests in "The Tonight Show," the company's "Amen" and "Mr. 
President" series, a percentage interest in "Late Night With David Letterman," and cash flow from segments of "TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes," which the company produced with Dick Clark Productions Inc. 

   Bear Stearns &amp; Co. is managing the sale, Mr. Mahoney said.
