   There are no plans for Jane Pauley to co-anchor
the ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw, NBC News president Michael
Gartner says. But he's not ruling out the possibility.
   ``He specifically said, `We never say never,''' network
spokeswoman Betty Hudson told reporters in a briefing on Gartner's
closed-door presentation at the NBC affiliates' convention Wednesday.
   NBC Television president Pier Mapes emphasized that Pauley's
first priority is a series of prime-time specials. She also will do
special reports for ``Nightly'' and fill in for Brokaw.
   Pauley left NBC's troubled ``Today'' show in December after the
network brought in Deborah Norville.
   In an interview in July's issue of Ladies' Home Journal, Pauley
insisted NBC was not trying to force her out. But she said her
husband, ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau, was skeptical.
   ``His initial reaction to NBC's handling of the whole thing was
`slash and burn,''' Pauley said in an interview ``I remember him
telling someone that most people in my position would have left tire
tracks on Deborah's back.''
   But Pauley said she admires the way Norville has handled the
controversy.
   ``If it had been me getting all that criticism, I would not have
been functioning professionally,'' she said. ``I probably wouldn't
have wanted to show my face.''

   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner has promised to
apologize for calling Christianity ``a religion for losers'' when he
speaks at a church luncheon next week, the church pastor says.
   ``He made the statement he wants a chance to apologize to the
world, but would say other things we might not like,'' said the Rev.
Johnny Hunt of the 3,500-member First Baptist Church of Woodstock.
   Hunt said Turner initiated the idea for the June 13 luncheon at
the suburban Atlanta church, where a former girlfriend and a fishing
buddy are members.
   Turner criticized Christians last year and again last month at
the National Convention of the American Humanist Association when he
was named Humanist of the Year.
   Hunt speculated that maybe Turner ``hasn't met the right ones.''

   James Michener wrote a plea to three
young men who pleaded guilty to anti-Semitic vandalism: ``Get off
that doomed train right now.''
   A judge had given the men an unusual sentence: learn about the
Nazi Holocaust. Part of the assignment was to read a chapter from
the author's book ``Poland'' on a concentration camp.
   After learning of the sentence, Michener wrote to the men through
the judge, John Carey, who said Wednesday he was moved by the
author's interest.
   ``Fellows, what you're doing is wrong,'' Michener wrote. ``You
will stain yourselves if you follow that route. Get off that doomed
train right now.''
   Michael Morano, 18, Michael Venturino, 18, and Neville Anthony
Mason, 20, pleaded guilty to defacing a high school a year ago.
   Michener's books include ``Chesapeake,'' ``The Drifters'' and the
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Tales of the South Pacific.''

   Dick Clark has kept the company of millions
during his 43 years in broadcast. But he always plays to an audience
of one.
   ``I visualize in my mind, I learned this from my idols of years
ago, that there's only one person listening or watching and you
direct yourself to that person,'' Clark said in an interview.
   ``It's a secret that Arthur Godfrey knew very well, Garry Moore
knew very well _ the pioneers learned that lesson years ago.''
   On Wednesday, Clark was counted among the pioneers. He accepted
membership in the Emerson Radio Hall of Fame along with Charles
Osgood, Paul Harvey, Harry Caray, Bob Hope and Frank Stanton.
   Clark, 60, has been around the radio and TV dials since 1947,
starting at a radio station in Utica.

   Georgia Rae Keithley is
following in the footsteps of her father, punk-rock singer Joey
Keithley _ but into the movies, not the music scene.
   The 8-month-old has been chosen from hundreds of candidates as
one of the two tots who will play Julie in ``Look Who's Talking
Too,'' which starts shooting next week in Vancouver.
   Her father, lead singer of the band DOA, made his movie debut
earlier this year as thuggish Officer Friendly in ``Terminal City
Ricochet.'' He has also appeared in television's ``Secret Lives''
and ``Wiseguy.''
   ``Look Who's Talking Too'' is a sequel to the hit ``Look Who's
Talking,'' in which an infant's thoughts are expressed in Bruce
Willis' voice. Roseanne Barr will provide the voice of Julie,
Mikey's younger sister.
