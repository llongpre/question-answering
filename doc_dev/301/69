   Sam Rogoway has been in front of a mike
since he was a tyke.
   Now he puts it to you this way:
   ``Hey, mammas and papas, brothers and sisters ... Are you ready
to rock 'n' roll your souls and get down to the deepest hole in the
bottom of the bowl? ... I'm Little Ricky Rocko, the world's
youngest disc jockey.''
   Every Friday, 9-year-old Sam is excused from his fourth-grade
classes to perform a one-hour live show with two grown-up DJs.
   In the studio, he stands on a box to reach a microphone half the
size of his head. Lately he's grown tall enough to reach the
headphone switch, something he couldn't do two years ago when he
started.
   Sam takes his music seriously. He likes heavy metal _ Guns &amp;
Roses, Def Leppard, Poison _ and his favorite group is Bon Jovi.
   ``Little Ricky Rocko's Rockin' Report,'' a 15-minute weekly
segment, tells the latest rock music news. Sam's father, Dave
Rogoway, said the program is heading for syndication.
   ``Sam has always had good verbal skills,'' his father said. ``He
never did the goo-goo thing. He just got up in his crib and started
talking.''
   He was still little when he began imitating his father, whose
own brief career as a disc jockey started at age 14.
   For hours, 5-year-old Sam would amuse himself with a toy disc
jockey set and his father's records.
   ``He was absolutely obsessed,'' Rogoway recalled. ``It got to
the point that if I heard (The Beach Boys') `Fun, Fun, Fun' again,
I was going to take the thing back.''
   In 1987, Rogoway was making a commercial at a local radio
station and he took Sam along to make a fun tape of the boy's disc
jockey persona.
   Rogoway was transferring the tape to a cassette when the station
manager heard the juvenile voice of ``Little Ricky Rocko.''
   It was the sound of a great radio gimmick.
   In 1987, Sam recorded his first show for KAAR-AM in Vancouver,
Wash. Last year he switched to KKRZ-FM in Portland.
   His father said Little Ricky Rocko earns ``more than the
medium-income wage earner'' for the two programs and several
personal appearances a week.
   In an interview, Sam said: ``I lead like two lives. I go to
school and go home and play basketball and I'm Sam Rogoway. Then I
have to turn into a different person when I'm Little Ricky Rocko.''
   The ``world's youngest disc jockey'' has appeared on ``Good
Morning, America'' and chatted with Dick Clark, who recently
retired as ``the world's oldest teen-ager.''
   It's OK with his parents if Sam wants to take voice and acting
lessons come summer. But what Sam wants most is to have his own
band by the time he's 13. But boys' plans _ like boys' voices _
have a way of changing.
   His parents have tried to explain that program formats change
and radio stations get sold, too.
   ``That's my greatest fear,'' Rogoway said. ``If the bit died, no
matter how much he's been prepared. I think it would take him time
to get adjusted to a regular kid's life.''
