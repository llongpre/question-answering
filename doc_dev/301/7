<HEAD>Dick Clark To Serve Up Nostalgia At Restaurant</HEAD>

   Dick Clark, whose ``American Bandstand'' spanned
decades of musical tastes, intends to see if he can get to the top
of the charts satisfying tastes for food.
   He expects to open his American Bandstand Grill in downtown Miami
by January and greet patrons with a heavy dose of nostalgia,
including rock 'n' roll memorabilia such as Elvis Presley's cape and
Elton John's shoes.
   The two-story establishment will resemble the studio from
``Bandstand,'' which premiered in Philadelphia in 1952. Clark joined
the show four years later and was the program's host for more than
30 years until earlier this year.
   Dancers will be able to watch themselves on television monitors,
another trademark of ``Bandstand.'' Also planned is a recording
studio where aspiring singers can make a tape complete with
background singers, music and an introduction by the 59-year-old
Clark.
   ``American Bandstand,'' a fixture on ABC-TV for years, is TV's
longest-running musical program and continues to air on the USA
cable network.
   At the upscale Bayfront setting where Clark intends to open for
business, another celebrity has failed in similar venture. In
February, Mariel Hemingway's restaurant, Zemo's, closed after only a
month.
