   Volume control and the absence of mosquitoes,
ants and rain are some of the advantages of spending the Fourth of
July in front of the tube.
   A few of the guests on holiday television specials are also
unlikely to show up at the family picnic, not to mention some
spectacular fireworks displays.
   But regardless how spectacular is TV's version of July Fourth, it
is traditionally the lowest viewing period of the year. Most
Americans prefer to celebrate Independence Day with the real thing,
even if it means listening to Uncle Herbert instead of Henry Mancini
or waving a sparkler in the back yard rather than watching the
rockets' red glare over the Jefferson Memorial.
   But for those stuck indoors, or who choose to be inside,
television is doing its part.
   CBS gets an early start on the festivities with a
pre-Independence Day special Monday, ``Freedom Festival '89.'' Buena
Vista Television is syndicating a live Fourth of July special from
Walt Disney World. But the patriotic place to be is the nation's
capital, and PBS takes viewers there with its traditional ``Capitol
Fourth'' concert.
   Patrick Duffy of ``Dallas'' is host of the one-hour CBS special,
which was taped outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall.
   The show is a string of tributes: to the music of the street by
Philly native Frankie Avalon, to America's musical heritage by the
Oak Ridge Boys, to the nation's ethnic diversity by Nell Carter and
the Philadelphia Mummers, and to freedom by Take 6, the a capella
singing group.
   Public television stations will offer ``A Capitol Fourth 1989''
on Tuesday night, a traditional live concert from the grounds of the
U.S. Capitol where thousands gather with picnics to enjoy the music
and the fireworks.
   E.G. Marshall is host this year of the 90-minute broadcast.
Musical guests include James Galway, Henry Mancini, Pearl Bailey and
Peter Nero. James Conlon conducts the National Symphony Orchestra.
   The 1989 ``Capitol Fourth'' is the 10th in the concert series.
Highlights include flutist Galway's participation in a salute to
Mancini _ with Mancini conducting the orchestra. Pianist Nero plans
to play George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue.'' Bailey will sing
``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ``God Bless America.'' Conlon,
currently music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic, will lead
the NSO in the traditional rousing medley of Sousa marches for the
finale _ the fireworks display over the Washington Monument.
   Buena Vista's ``Walt Disney World 4th of July Spectacular'' is
also live Tuesday night and has been syndicated in 95 percent of the
nation's television markets. The prime-time, two-hour special stars
the rock group New Kids on the Block, gospel singer Sandi Patti,
weatherman Willard Scott, Miss America and the cast of the new
Mickey Mouse Club.
   The special, set at Walt Disney World, will include a look at new
attractions at the amusement park, coverage of the Walt Disney
World's traditional Fourth of July parades and a musical salute to
Independence Day.
