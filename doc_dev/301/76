   Paul McCartney returned to Japan's stage Saturday
after a 24-year absence with a smoky, laser-studded show peppered
with old Beatles hits.
   ``It's great to be back,'' McCartney told 60,000 fans at the
Tokyo Dome, an indoor baseball stadium where McCartney will perform
his six Japan concerts.
   It was a rousing comeback to Japan for the 47-year-old
McCartney. The last time he tried to tour Japan he was arrested
before even leaving the airport after customs officials found 219
grams of marijuana among his belongings.
   The ex-Beatle was held for 10 days before he was expelled and
banned from ever returning. But based on his clean record for the
past five years, he was granted special permission by the Justice
Ministry to perform.
   McCartney said at a news conference Thursday he now would tell
people ``be straight and stay natural and don't use any drugs or
stimulants or booze.''
   After playing ``Band on the Run'' from his days with his old
band Wings, McCartney told the crowd he would take them ``to a very
faraway place called the 60s,'' and whipped off ``The Long and
Winding Road,'' ``Can't Buy Me Love'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band.''
   McCartney's world tour started in Oslo, Norway, last September
and has taken him through Britain, continental Europe and the
United States. From Japan, the band travels to Australia, back to
the United States, to Brazil and finishes in Europe in April.

   Conway Twitty is picky when it comes to
selecting songs for his country music albums. He says he reviews up
to 3,000 songs before he chooses 10.
   ``We go through this town with a seine, or a sifter,'' he said
Friday at the annual Country Radio Seminar. ``We go through 2,500
to 3,000 songs before I pick the 10 that I do. There's nothing more
important than that song.''
   Twitty said a career ``starts with great songs and ends with bad
songs. So always do great songs and you'll stay in this business a
long time.''
   The seminar is for employees at country music radio stations.
   Twitty is a veteran country music performer known for his hit
records ``It's Only Make Believe'' and ``Linda on My Mind.''
