   For the fifth year running, a Texan has
walked down the runway as the winner of the Miss USA contest.
   ``They called my name and I was shocked,'' Gretchen Polhemus said
after she won the pageant Tuesday night.
   The 23-year-old cattle broker and real estate agent from Fort
Worth said she thought her runner-up, Jill Scheffert of Oklahoma
City, was the winner.
   Richard Guy, director of the Texas USA pageant, said the state's
fifth winning entry in the Miss USA Pageant just showed that
``classy, elegant, today women'' are victorious.
   Guy was in the Texas cheering section waving a Lone Star flag.
   He and his partner, Rex Holt, have developed into pageant gurus,
coaching the last five Texas contestants, as well as the 1977 Texas
entry, to victory through their agency, Guyrex Associates.
   Guyrex last week was featured on an ABC-TV ``20-20'' segment that
detailed the rigorous training given winning contestants represented
by the agency.
   A ``20-20'' team was filming Guy again Tuesday night.
   Miss Polhemus was crowned at the conclusion of a dazzling,
internationally televised two-hour production on CBS from the Mobile
Civic Center. Dick Clark and Angie Dickinson served as masters of
ceremonies.
   ``I'm so proud of her,'' Miss Polhemus' mother, Pat, said,
hugging a ``lucky'' stuffed toy cow.
   Prizes and gifts amounting to $200,000 goes with the title.
   The other finalists, besides Miss Oklahoma, were Miss New Jersey
Deborah Lee Husti; Miss Louisiana Elizabeth Primm; and Miss Georgia
Michele Nemeth.
   After the winner was crowned, the contestants went to a
coronation ball.
   Fifty-one women from each state and the District of Columbia
competed.
   Miss Polhemus said she will pursue an entertainment career while
continuing her real estate and livestock businesses in Fort Worth.
   The program was highlighted by a dance number with broadway star
Tommy Tune and the 51 contestants stepping to ``Is It True What They
Say About Dixie?''
   Miss Polhemus inherited the crown from Miss USA Courtney Gibbs,
22.
   The 11-member judging panel consisted of author Jude Deveraux;
modeling manager Bonnie Kay; Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, pilots of
the experimental Voyager aircraft; actress Stella Stevens; tennis
player Roscoe Tanner; Linda Shelton, an aerobics instructor; Lillian
Glass, author of ``Talk to Win''; actor Richard Anderson; Cecilia
Bolocco, Miss Universe 1987; and former Olympic diver Jennifer
Chandler.
