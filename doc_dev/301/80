   The Miss Teen USA pageant crowned
a petite redhead who wants to help child victims of drug or alcohol
abuse, but disqualified a contestant and declined to say why.
   The winner of Monday night's nationally televised pageant was
16-year-old Mindy Duncan of Hillsboro, Ore.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said the Newberg High School student. ``It's
a feeling you can't explain.''
   Miss Duncan, a 5-foot, 3-inch enthusiast of dancing, running and
water skiing, said it is her ambition to work with children who
suffer drug or alcohol problems. She has done some of this work as
a volunteer.
   Midway through Monday night's proceedings, officials began
referring to 50 contestants instead of the 51 initially entered.
   No formal announcement of the disqualification of Miss Teen
California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno of El Toro, was made until
reporters questioned the change in the number of contestants.
   Roger Neal, a pageant spokesman, said in a brief statement that
Miss Moreno broke a pageant rule. She was allowed to participate in
the CBS-TV broadcast but was dropped from eligibility.
   Later, a newspaper reporter who persisted in attempting to
determine why Miss Moreno was declared ineligible was escorted from
the pageant site by security guards and told not to return.
   Pageant officials said the matter of eligibility rested between
the pageant and Miss Moreno, and declined to elaborate, citing her
age.
   TV personality Dick Clark and actress Tracy Scoggins were hosts
of the pageant, whose contestants ranged from ages 15-18.
   Miss Duncan succeeds Kristi Addis of Holcolm, Miss., and wins
$150,000 in cash and prizes, including a Jeep, jewelry, a mink coat
and mink jacket, exercise equipment and an electronic keyboard.
   This year's four runners-up were: Jessica Collins of Amsterdam,
N.Y.; Amy Pietsch of Ringgold, La.; Kathleen McClellan of
Bloomington, Ill.; and Anna Mingus of Enterprise, Ala.
