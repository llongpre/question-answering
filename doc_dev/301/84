   Some of the new shows on the networks' fall
schedule aren't so new, but they'll do the job until late October
and November when the real fall schedule kicks in.
   Because of the four-month writers strike, the networks made
commitments to some series that were ``strike-proof'' as well as
others that weren't really all that good but looked better because
at least they were written.
   Two ABC ``place-holders'' are old series being re-shot from the
original scripts.
   ``Mission Impossible'' premieres Oct. 23 and will fill in for
``A Fine Romance,'' an ambitious international romantic comedy,
filmed in Europe, that won't get on the air until January. Peter
Graves returns in the role he created in the late '60s, but the
rest of the cast is new. One of them is Phil Morris, son of Greg
Morris, a main character on the original show. The series is being
shot in Australia.
   ABC is also reviving ``Police Story,'' which will premiere Oct.
29. The original, created by Joseph Wambaugh, ran in the 1970s and
was one of the best police dramas television has ever seen. An
anthology series, it is filling in for ``The ABC Mystery Movie,'' a
rotating movie series that will include a rejuvenated ``Columbo,''
starring Peter Falk, that is delayed until January.
   CBS has already begun running the sitcoms ``The Cavanaughs,''
which will be replaced when ``Coming of Age'' comes in Oct. 31, and
``First Impressions,'' which was to have been a mid-season
replacement, but fills in for ``Raising Miranda,'' which premieres
Nov. 5.
   Some of the interim programming will never get on the air
because once the strike was settled, some new shows were delayed by
only a few weeks. NBC has kept an option for instance on ``The
Hardy Boys,'' but doesn't plan to do more than a movie or so
instead of the series.
   CBS bought but has yet to give an air date to ``Jake's
Journey,'' a funny, Monty Python-esque fantasy-comedy in which an
American teen-ager takes up with an medieval knight, played by
Monty Python's Graham Chapman. Also yet to get an air date from CBS
is ``Dolphin Bay,'' a family drama set around a scientist studying
dolphins in Australia. Shades of ``Flipper.''
   Some other ``reality-based'' fillers:
   CBS has ``High Risk,'' a magazine-type show that features
reports on people with dangerous jobs or hobbies. It will be
replaced Nov. 29 by ``TV 101,'' a back-to-school drama about kids
learning to make a television newscast.
   Beginning Oct. 29, ABC has ``Trackdown,'' another ``America's
Most Wanted''-type show. In this one, viewers watch police bring in
parole violators. It fills in for the George Segal crime drama
``Murphy's Law,'' which makes its debut Dec. 3.
   CBS is offering an entertainment series, ``Live! Dick Clark
Presents,'' which has already premiered and runs until Oct. 26 when
the sitcoms ``The Van Dyke Show'' and the as-yet untitled new Mary
Tyler Moore show premiere.
   Strike-proof shows that seem to have made the schedule without
caveat are NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' a weekly magazine series
based on the highly successful specials of last season, and ABC's
``Incredible Sunday,'' a rejuvenation of ``That's Incredible!''
