   Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland
performed their songs ``How Sweet It Is To Be Loved by You'' and
``Baby I Need Your Love'' as they were inducted into the
Songwriters Hall of Fame.
   The three shared the spotlight at the 19th annual Songwriters
Hall of Fame Awards banquet Monday night with Mary Wilson, who was
in the Supremes when that trio became famous singing
Holland-Dozier-Holland songs. She included ``Baby I Need Your
Love'' in a medley she performed and the writers declared she did
it better than they did.
   Film clips accompanied the induction of the late Sir Noel
Coward, who was seen singing his composition ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' and Leroy Anderson, shown playing his ``Syncopated
Clock'' on the piano.
   The National Academy of Popular Music, which sponsored the
banquet, gave its lifetime achievement award to television
perennial Dick Clark, who said he had never written a song.
