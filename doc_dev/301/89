<HEAD>Rock Hudson's Ex-Lover Files $22 Million Libel Suit Over Depiction

   Rock Hudson's ex-lover claimed Wednesday in a
$22 million libel lawsuit that he was maliciously portrayed as a
psychotic criminal by the authors of a book about the late actor.
   Marc Christian, who won $5.5 million from the Hudson estate a
year ago in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, said in a Superior Court
lawsuit filed by celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson that he was
shamed by the book's depiction of him.
   The Tom Clark and Dick Kleiner book ``Rock Hudson, Friend of
Mine,'' released last month, referred to Christian as ``a criminal,
a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an
extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist
and a squatter,'' the lawsuit said.
   Mitchelson said the portrayal was false and that Christian was
asking $11 million in general damages and $11 million in punitive
damages for a loss of ``his reputation, shame and mortification.''
   ``He's just not going to sit still for it,'' Mitchelson said.
``We asked them to take out all the passages we felt were libelous
and they didn't take them out.''
   In addition to Clark and Kleiner, the lawsuit names New
York-based Pharos Books as defendants. Martha Clark, a spokeswoman
for the publisher, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
   ``The written statements are libelous on their face because
Christian is charged with improper and immoral conduct,''
Mitchelson said. ``They aren't backed up by any facts at all.
   ``The most scurrilous one of all was that Marc knew Hudson had
AIDS at the time Hudson learned he had it,'' the attorney said.
``It says he might have known it before Hudson knew.''
   That issue was prominent in Christian's suit against the Hudson
estate.
   A jury ruled in February 1989 that Hudson was guilty of
``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from
Christian, his lover for two years. Christian said he didn't learn
of the actor's illness until a few months before Hudson, 58, died
on Oct. 5, 1985.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' Christian testified about the
terror that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure.
   Although Christian didn't contract AIDS and has tested negative
for the presence of the virus, the judge and the jury found he
deserved damages. It was a unique ruling in personal injury law on
sexually transmitted diseases.
   The jury ruled Christian should get $21.5 million, but Superior
Court Judge Bruce Geernaert ruled the amount excessive, deciding
last April that it should be whittled down to $5.5 million.
   Mitchelson said Christian has received $600,000 so far, but the
rest was tied up in appeals by the Hudson estate. He expects an
appellate court decision by the end of the year.
