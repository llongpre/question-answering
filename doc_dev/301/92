   Joan and Jayne Boyd, of Hammond, Ind., were singing
advertising jingles in the booth at CBS Radio in Chicago one
day in 1959 when they noticed a strange man staring at them.
   "We didn't think much of it. People always stared at us
because we were identical twins," recalls Jayne, whose
married name is Schwartz.

   But the man was an emissary from Philip K. Wrigley, of the
chewing-gum Wrigleys. Mr. Wrigley had an idea: To make the
Boyds the Doublemint Twins. It wasn't a bad idea.
   Soon, the Boyds were everywhere to be seen. They peered
out from billboards, they were on television, in newspapers
and magazines. "We were kind of shoved down the public's
throat," says Mrs. Schwartz, whose husband, Al, produces "TV
Bloopers and Practical Jokes," as the senior vice president
for Dick Clark Productions. "No matter where we were in the
world, people recognized us," says the other twin, Joan
Hackett, who is now divorced. She works in sales at a chic
Chicago boutique.
   Ad-agency types were contemptuous. "The so-called experts
called them corny," says Roger Mohr, an advertising executive
who worked on the campaign. But so what? The late Mr. Wrigley
wasn't trying to be clever; he wanted to burn in a brand
name: "To tell them quick and tell them often," Mr. Wrigley
said. In the early '60s, while the Boyds were under exclusive
contract with Wrigley and their TV ads appeared 15 to 20
times a day nationally, Doublemint became the No. 1 gum in
the country.
   Now, 32 years and 20 sets of frolicking female and male
twins later, including the first set of black twins last
year, the concept is still used. And Doublemint is still the
biggest seller. The ads were, however, dumped temporarily
during the Persian Gulf war, "because it wasn't appropriate
to show people having fun," says a Wrigley spokesman.
   The Boyd twins made 12 TV commercials between 1959 and
1963. Together recently to celebrate their 53rd birthday,
they struck up that old refrain: "Double your pleasure,
double your fun, with double good, double good, Doublemint
gum."
   And they still wax melodic about their lives: "We took a
little criticism," says Joan. "But we became famous and made
a lot of money." In the process, so did Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.
of Chicago.
