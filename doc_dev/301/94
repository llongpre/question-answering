   Ohio State University wants Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov _ both for its faculty and for an honorary
degree, but his wife says she doubts that he can come.
   ``He has received many, many invitations from other universities,
but he never has received permission from his government to go,''
Yelena Bonner said in a telephone interview Saturday with The
Columbus Dispatch. ``I don't know when he will have the
possibility.''
   Mrs. Bonner, contacted about 2 a.m. Moscow time, said that her
husband was asleep and could not come to the telephone.
   Sakharov, 67, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his continuing
fight for human rights in the Soviet Union. He was not allowed to
leave the country to accept the honor.
   During a 90-minute news conference Friday in Moscow, Sakharov
endorsed some of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's political
policies.
   ``On the whole, I believe perestroika is a serious undertaking
and its international and domestic implications are very serious,
too.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's plan for social and economic
restructuring in the Soviet Union.
   The OSU Board of Trustees Friday approved giving an honorary
doctorate in science to Sakharov.
   OSU President Edward H. Jennings wrote letters of invitation to
Sakharov in English and Russian. Rolf F. Barth, a professor of
pathology, was to hand-deliver the letters.
   Jennings said he also wants Sakharov, who helped develop the
Soviet hydrogen bomb, to join the faculty here.
   ``Although we admire his work in human rights, the degree is
definitely for his pioneering work as a physicist,'' said George
Smith, a professor who is chairman of the committee on honorary
degrees.

   The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth _ regarded as
the pioneer of Birmingham civil rights activism _ accepted the honor
of the renaming of a street forily and friends who suffered through
the movement with him as he survived three bombings and more
beatings than he likes to remember.
   ``They shared the burden,'' Shuttlesworth said. ``If the good
people are silent, then the evil people triumph.''
   A group of city dignitaries officially named Huntsville Road, the
route of many civil rights confrontations, the ``F.L. Shuttlesworth
Drive.''
   Shuttleworth has been the focus of much of last week's Reunion of
the Civil Rights Activists of 1963. The three-day, 25th-anniversary
event ended Friday with a mass rally at Sardis Baptist Church with
Shuttlesworth as the featured speaker.
   Shuttlesworth is credited with laying a foundation for the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s intervention in the city's problems in 1963.
   Councilman Roosevelt Bell called the reunion a ``stockholders
meeting'' of all the people who benefited from the civil rights
movement.
   He called the renaming of the road a ``dividend.''

   The ``Shrinkettes,'' a cheerleading
squad of Wal-Mart Stores employees from New Iberia, La., stole the
show from company founder Sam Walton in their debut at the annual
stockholders meeting.
   The seven-member squad, clad in blue and orange uniforms with big
letters across the front that together spelled out ``Wal-Mart,''
took the stage Friday at Walton's request.
   The squad was formed in February to fight the battle of
shrinkage, which they defined in a cheer as ``anything not accounted
for.''
   Walton asked for a microphone so the crowd could hear them. No
need. ``We talk loud,'' said squad leader Xavier Lewis, to which
Walton conceded and said, borrowing the Cajun phrase, ``Laissez les
bons temps roulez'' _ let the good times roll.
   The Shrinkettes, merciless on shrinkage during their routine,
cheered ``Crush it, crush it!''

   Country music singer Barbara Mandrell
used ringers to win a come-from-behind victory over a team led by
Bob Hope in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   A bevy of celebrities including talk show host Oprah Winfrey,
entertainer Dick Clark, rock musician Meat Loaf and rap musician
L.L. Cool J turned out for the 18-17 victory Friday by Mandrell's
AT&amp;T Ringers over Hope's Pepsi Challengers.
   Before the game, Hope was anything but pessimistic.
   ``Pay no attention to Barbara's team,'' the comedian said.
``We're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna win, even if we have to cheat.''
   Mandrell literally got a lift from former Pittsburgh Steelers
great Lynn Swann during one of her trips to the plate. Swann hoisted
the petite singer parallel to the ground, and began swinging his new
``bat.''
   In the second inning, John Stamos, the heartthrob of the ``Full
House'' television show, strutted to the plate and made two strikes
before grounding to Ron Perlman, star of the ``Beauty and the
Beast'' TV show. Stamos joked he ``was a lover not an athlete.''
   ``I'll be the judge of that,'' said pop star Sheena Easton.
   Proceeds from the game went to the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center transplant program.
