Los Angeles is a fountain of youth with all kinds of new firsts on the social 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's First Chair Society entertained at its 
first Leading Ladies' Matinee on Wednesday morning. Said co-president Jennifer 
Diener: "In Salzburg, they have matinees in the morning. I thought it would be 
different." The morning Matinee, planned by Carol Henry, feted the big donors, 
and among the Ladies were Susie Barker, Peggy Parker, Rosalind Millstone, 
Barbara Reilly, Debbie Tellefsen, Judith Rosen, Kay Duke Ingalls, Dorothy Woods 
and Jane Arnault. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at a sit-down at the Hilton, Jack and Elaine Lerman, Marty and Marjorie 
Roth, Dr. Stan and Jackie Furer, and Hal and Cynthia Gershman decided to form a 
new charitable foundation -- Associates for Breast Cancer Studies. They've 
pledged 75% of all monies raised to the John Wayne Cancer Clinic. The Furers 
have donated their guest house for an office, the Gershmans provided phones and 
office equipment, the Lermans a computer, the Marty Greenbergs a 3-M Copier, 
and the Norman Ripps gave office supplies. They plan a membership affair Dec. 
21 at Jimmy's. 
</P>

And those spectacular examples of eternal youth -- Bob Hope and Dick Clark -- 
celebrate inauguration of the National Parkinson Foundation California Research 
Laboratories at USC's Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANA: Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee and the 
honoree at the Americana Associates' Americana Ball, couldn't resist. He picked 
up a guitar and sang with Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham's Sweet Baby Blues Band at 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire the other evening. 
</P>
<P>
That's the black-tie affair Lydia Webb chaired to raise funds for Project 
Americana of the Fine Arts Committee at the State Department. In the spotlight 
were former Ambassador to Australia William (Bill)Lane, Ginie and Henry Braun, 
Glen and Gloria Holden, Chuck and Diane Norris, Roy and Pauline Naftzger and 
Lydia's daughter Mary Ann Hunt (one of the Texas Hunts) and her escort, Andrew 
Reisini of New York.

<P>
Now Lydia and her husband, Dr. Roscoe C. Webb Jr., will attend Canadian Consul 
Gen. Joan Winser's welcoming reception Wednesday at the Canadian residence for 
Canada's prime minister, the Rt. Hon. Brian Mulroney and Mrs. Mulroney, and 
then they and Mary Beth and Robert Van Dine are off to Washington, invited for 
dinner with President George and Barbara Bush on Thursday and luncheon at the 
home of Vice president Dan and Marilyn Quayle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
ENCORE: The American Horse Show Assn.'s New York tradition -- Champagne at 
Cartier -- was brought to Cartier on Rodeo Drive last year with such success 
that it was a repeat the other evening with Marion Scharffenberger and Mrs. 
Allan M. Cartter co-chairing the reception to raise funds for young rider 
programs of the National Equestrian Federation of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Joining in was honorary chair Stefanie Powers (who had just returned from the 
Polish Arabian national sales). More there to support future Olympic efforts 
were Bettina Bancroft Klink and her daughter Elisabeth Goth Clark, Montgomery 
and Jo Fisher, Robin Parsky, jockey Chris and Judy McCarron, Chris Shoemaker 
and Olympic rider Lisa Jacquin. Flying in for the party were the association 
president, James C. Wofford, and his wife, Gail, of Uppervillle, Va., and Jane 
Forbes Clark of New York.
