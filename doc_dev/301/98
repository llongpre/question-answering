   Producer Nicolas Noxon acknowledges that
telling the story of 100 years of the National Geographic Society
presented a few sticky problems.
   First of all, how do you get a century of exploration around the
world, and in recent years out of this world, into a 90-minute
documentary?
   ``We adopted a pretty pragmatic attitude,'' said Noxon, whose
production of ``The Explorers: A Century of Discovery'' is his
latest for National Geographic. ``The formula I worked out was that
we would put in film on all the important things from the past 100
years and leave everything else out.
   ``Once I resigned myself to the coffee-table concept, once we
got comfortable with that, it worked out pretty well. If we applied
too rigid a test we'd leave out things we wanted in. We came up
with `The Explorers' for the title. If we strayed too far from that
we weren't true to the theme.''
   Noxon also faced the problem of keeping it from becoming just a
cut-and-paste job.
   ``One of our dilemmas was that after all the musts we didn't
have much time for electives,'' he said. ``Certain things just had
to go in. We wanted to add some new film, but it was very
limiting.''
   New film for the 100th anniversary documentary includes a
sequence on mapping the sky at Mount Palomar and a look at the Nova
Scotia home of Geographic founder Alexander Graham Bell.
   Appropriately, ``The Explorers'' will be telecast on Columbus
Day, Wednesday, on PBS.
   The show is largely told with archival photographs and film,
much of it never before seen on television. Associate editor Terry
Koenig, an Emmy winner for ``Secrets of the Titanic,'' worked
closely with Noxon in putting the film together. Among the
highlights:
   _Conquest of the North Pole by Robert Peary, and Richard Byrd's
flight over the South Pole;
   _Exploration of Alaska's Valley of 10,000 Smokes in 1917, the
first Geographic expedition to be documented in motion pictures;
   _William Beebe's descent a half-mile into the ocean depths in a
bathysphere;
   _Harrowing exploration of the stratosphere in a hydrogen-filled
balloon by Army Air Corps officers in 1934; and
   _A 1931 French motor expedition from Beirut to Peking, including
an attempt to drive across the Himalayas.
   ``I came here in 1960 after doing some educational and
institutional films in Washington,'' Noxon said. ``I went to work
for David Wolper in 1965, when he was doing documentaries. I
fancied myself a documentarian, and Wolper was like a rocket then.
I started doing the Geographic specials with Wolper. The first one
I did was `Voyage of the Brigantine Yankee.' The next one I did was
`Dr. Leakey and the Dawn of Man.'''
   Noxon left Wolper after six years, but then returned to do more
Geographic specials. In later years, he produced the specials for
WQED-TV in Pittsburgh. Noxon recently joined ABC-Kane Productions,
founded by Dennis Kane, former head of television for the National
Geographic Society, in association with ABC.
   He has made documentaries on wildlife, early Hollywood, diving
for Spanish treasure, transatlantic liners and many other subjects.
   ``It's amazing what television's been willing to deal with,'' he
said. ``Those of us in the West have rarely succeeded in placing
news-oriented shows with the networks. We were able to get in with
the wildlife shows. In 1966, I was able to talk about ecology,
which was certainly an unknown word then, in a show about the
grizzly bear. We were able to offer the hard idea that the
grizzlies were disappearing and were worth saving.
   ``I got thrown out of Kenya for a show on the vanishing
elephant. That was another unpopular idea. Elephants eat the same
food as people, and people kill the elephants. What can we do? I
don't think we've answered that yet.
   ``But I think by protecting their monopoly on documentaries the
networks have missed a lot. Dennis' company is the first
semiautonomous documentary production group started by a network in
many years.''

   FAVORITE MOVIES _ As the election draws near, Jerry Lewis and
Dick Clark are drumming up the votes. But not for president. Lewis
is host of Clark's production of ``America Picks the All-Time
Favorite Movies'' on ABC on Sunday, Oct. 16. A special 900 number
has been set up for viewers to cast their votes for their film
favorites. Among the guests on the show, however, will be Academy
Award winner Olympia Dukakis (``Moonstruck''), a cousin of
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
