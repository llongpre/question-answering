   Texas cattle broker Gretchen Polhemus claimed
the Miss USA crown Tuesday night, making it the fifth year in a row
a Texan has won the beauty pageant.
   ``It's absolutely wonderful,'' said the 23-year-old Fort Worth
beauty.
   She said she had expected Miss Oklahoma Jill Scheffert to win the
pageant, but, ``This was my year.'' Miss Scheffert, 20, of Oklahoma
was the first runner-up.
   The other finalists were, in order, Miss New Jersey Deborah Lee
Husti of Rockaway, N.J.; Miss Louisiana Elizabeth Primm of Houma,
La.; and Miss Georgia Michele Nemeth of Lilburn, Ga.
   Miss Polhemus was crowned at the conclusion of a dazzling,
internationally televised production from the Mobile Civic Center.
   A home-state delegation waved the Texas state flag in victory
when emcee Dick Clark announced the winner. Actress Angie Dickinson
was co-emcee of the two-hour pageant attended by 1,200 people.
   In her biography, the 5-foot-11, green-eyed new Miss USA said she
will pursue an entertainment career while continuing her current
real estate business and livestock broker business in Fort Worth.
   The program was highlighted by a dance number with broadway star
Tommy Tune and the 51 contestants stepping out to, ``Is It True What
They Say About Dixie?''
   The swimsuit display brought out hot pink and an array of colors
as the 10 semifinalists showed off one-piece swimsuits.
   The 51 women from every state and the District of Columbia
competed in categories of swimsuit and evening gown, where the focus
was partly on physique.
   However, celebrity judges said that the contestants' personal
interviews were where they revealed the best of their personalities.
   ``You want beauty, but there's a lot more to it _ like strength
and stamina,'' author Jude Deveraux said, prior to the judging.
   ``Personality, intellect, charisma, and endurance are
important,'' added judge Bonnie Kay, president of Select Model
Management of New York. ``Outer beauty counts 50 percent.''
   The judges were responding to criticism of the event from the
National Organization for Women, which denounced the two-hour
pageant as a ``Barbie doll contest.''
   ``We call for programs that encourage the development of the
whole woman. We call on society to value women for their
intellectual, charitable, athletic and artistic achievements,'' said
Betty Gartman, president of the local NOW chapter.
   The pageant winner will inherit the crown from Miss USA Courtney
Gibbs, 22. The winner will receive $200,000 in cash and prizes.
   Others on the 11-member judging panel were: Dick Rutan and Jeana
Yeager, pilots of the experimental Voyager aircraft; actress Stella
Stevens; tennis player Roscoe Tanner; Linda Shelton, an aerobics
instructor; Lillian Glass, author of ``Talk to Win;'' actor Richard
Anderson; Cecilia Bolocco, Miss Universe 1987; and former Olympic
diver Jennifer Chandler.
