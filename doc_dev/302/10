   A rare first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's first
book, a collection of poetry written when he was 14, is to be
auctioned by Sotheby's, which calls it ``the most exciting book
discovery in many years.''
   In the 161 years since its publication, only 11 other copies of
``Tamerlane and Other Poems'' have been found. Published in 1827 by
an obscure Boston printer when the poet, short story writer and
critic was 18, it could bring as much as $300,000 at auction on
June 7.
   This 12th copy of the book was discovered in a bin of early
20th-century pamphlets on fertilizers and farming machines by a
Massachusetts book collector while he browsed at an antique barn in
New Hampshire. The price was $15.
   Recognizing the title from an article he had once read, the
collector contacted Sotheby's for an inspection and appraisal.
   ``It was quite a thrill,'' said Jay Dillon, an assistant vice
president in Sotheby's Rare Books Department. ``God, it was
thrilling. ... Here's a fabulous rarity, famous to anyone who's
ever taken more than two courses in American literature.''
   The Massachusetts man, who collects books on local history, said
he suspected it might be an original when he found it, though he
wasn't sure. He had the book only one night before turning it over
to Sotheby's.
   ``I knew I had found something great, a piece of Americana
...,'' said the man, who spoke in a telephone interview on
condition of anonymity. ``I knew it was valuable but never dreamed
that it would mean this much money.''
   ``Actually, I didn't handle it real carefully when I first got
it,'' he said. ``I thumbed through it. ... I never read anything by
Poe in my life. I really don't know too much about books.''
   Poe, who was born in Boston in 1809, orphaned when he was 11 and
raised in Richmond, Va., had the volume published during a short
visit to Boston.
   The literary importance of the 40-page book, which names the
author only as ``A Bostonian,'' is considered negligible; rather,
the work's value has to do with the fact that it's the first work
of one of America's greatest writers and a limited number of copies
were printed.
   How many were printed?
   ``One can guess, but they are all wild,'' Dillon said. ``I think
the range would be from 50 to 250. I would be amazed if more than
500 were printed.''
   The softbound book has its original, tea-colored paper wrappers
and is in unrestored condition. ``The wrappers are frayed, as one
would expect in a 161-year-old pamphlet,'' Dillon said. ``There's
also a light stain on the front cover running through first few
pages.
   ``But the condition of a book like this is not a matter of great
importance among connoisseurs. The question with this book is how
can you get one at all. I would prefer it to be in better
condition. ... I also would prefer to have Poe's signature on it.''
   Nine of the other copies are in public institutions, one is
owned privately and the other's whereabouts is unknown, Dillon said.
   The first copy didn't surface until 1859 when an antiquarian
bookseller in Boston sent it along with a consignment of books to
an agent in London who promptly snatched it up for the British
Museum. A second copy turned up 23 years later in a bookshop's
sidewalk box. It cost 15 cents and later sold at auction in 1892
for $1,850.
   Other copies have surfaced over the years through collections
and dealers. The 11th copy was discovered in 1954 and was auctioned
by Sotheby's in 1974 for $123,000.
   The poems included in the book are ``Tamerlane'' and a group Poe
called ``The Fugitive Pieces.'' They are: ``To ---,'' ``Dreams,''
``Visit of the Dead,'' ``Evening Star'' (never again printed),
``Imitation,'' ``Stanzas,'' ``Poem,'' ``A Wilder'd Being,'' ``The
Happiest Day'' and ``The Lake.''
   The adolescent collection was not exactly the literary hit of
the day. One critic noted: ``A book the critics read without
praising, and the ladies praised without reading.''
   However, the complex and tortured artist was vindicated in later
years through his sinister and compelling stories such as ``The Pit
and the Pendulum'' and ``The Masque of the Red Death,'' and his
musical and sensuous poems such as ``Annabel Lee'' and ``The
Raven.''
   He published two other volumes of poetry after ``Tamerlane,'' in
1829 and 1831. Poe died in 1849.
