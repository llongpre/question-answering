Yeats said 'The intellect of man is forced to choose, perfection of the
life, or of the work'. Never can that dilemma have appeared with greater
clarity than it does in the lives of the two French poets, Baudelaire and
Mallarme, of whom new biographies have just appeared. Both of them sought
ceaselessly for perfection, and in many of their poems actually achieved it.
Between them they are largely responsible for the modern notion of formal
perfection as a poetic ideal. It was their disciplined response to the
interminable flood of verse that poured out of a Victor Hugo or a Tennyson.
Ironically it was the last of the fluent Victorians - Swinburne - who was
the first English poet to hail Baudelaire's genius - in an article in The
Spectator in 1862. Since then almost every major English poet, starting with
Yeats, Eliot and Auden, has paid tribute to Baudelaire as the founding
father of modernism.
The ideal of perfection helps to explain what we find most puzzling about
Baudelaire and Mallarme, their veneration for the work of Edgar Allen Poe.
Baudelaire's admiration for Poe verged on idolatry; he translated much of
Poe into French, one of the few things that brought Baudelaire some regular
income. Though Baudelaire was by far the greater poet, it was Poe's writings
on poetic technique and theory as well as the morbidity of his
subject-matter that fertilised the mind of Baudelaire. The seeds of the
Frenchman's notion of correspondence - involving a synthesis through words
of all the arts, music, dance, painting, literature - the bedrock of
symbolism, may be found in Poe.
But, as emerges from Joanna Richardson's massive new life of Baudelaire,
there were also remarkable parallels between his life and that of Poe. Both
lost their natural fathers when they were little; both became
mother-fixated; both had adoptive fathers of a military cast who despised
poetry; both adored women but found straightforward sex impossible; both
became chronic invalids; both were invariably in debt.
The last full biography of Baudelaire was by Enid Starkie in 1957. If her
scholarship could at times be faulted, Starkie was always an enthusiast and
she presented a Baudelaire redeemed by her admiration for his work. With
much fresh material at her disposal, Richardson gives us a remorseless march
of all the grim facts, concentrating on the poet's disastrous financial
situation. From his improvident youth to his death aged 46 it never
improved.
What makes it so heart-rending is that his degradation could easily have
been avoided. Baudelaire inherited a sizeable fortune at the age of 21.
Prudently managed he could have lived off it - supplemented by his small
literary earnings - in comfort and dignity for the rest of his life. Within
a few years he had got through half of it, and had burdened himself with
supporting a mulatto mistress Jeanne Duval - the Black Venus of his poetry -
from whom he caught the syphilis that ultimately resulted in the aphasia
(loss of the faculty of speech) that caused him to spend his last years as a
virtual mute.
General Jacques Aupick, the epitome of careerist respectability in the
Second Empire, called a family council to decide what to do about his
prodigal stepson. It was decided that Baudelaire's remaining capital should
be administered by a conseil judicaire allowing him a small annual income.
Baudelaire's stormy relations with his administrator, a family friend who
kept very tight control of the purse-strings, provide an element of pathetic
comedy in the sad story.
Apart from Jeanne Duval, two other women captured his heart - Apollonie
Sabatier, the white Venus who looked like one of Rubens models and who
inspired many of les Fleurs; and the actress Marie Daubrun, who was the
inspiration behind 'le Beau Navire' and 'L'Invitation au Voyage'. Baudelaire
competed for their favours among many gifted men. With the former he
triumphed to the point where she finally confessed her love for him. The
saddest episode of all is his inexplicable failure to turn this dream of a
perfect love into a reality.
Mallarme was one of the earliest of the younger French poets to recognise
Baudelaire's poetic mastery. His own life, freshly told by Gordon Millan,
professor of French Studies at Strathclyde University, was not quite such a
mess, though he too suffered from continual financial constraint. He made a
stable marriage, fathered a daughter who became his literary executor, and
acquired a reputation in his lifetime. But his work as a provincial
schoolmaster, irksome from the start, became intolerable as his poetic gift
developed.
Somehow he managed to get a posting to Paris where his house became a forum
of abstruse poetic speculation. His regular Tuesday evening gatherings were
attended by many artists and writers including the young Paul Valery, his
most gifted disciple. They were in no doubt about Baudelaire's genius and
they developed his theory of correspondence. Some of Mallarme's abstruse
poems and sonnets, always popular with English readers, exemplify it.
At least one of his longer works - 'L'Apres midi d'une Faune' - found a
perfect musical correspondence in the mind of Debussy - and after that in
the work of choreographers and dancers, Nijinsky, Lifar, Arthur Mitchell.
Millan's book reveals the slow evolution of the original poem. He
demonstrates the contrast between the poet's tormented, precarious existence
and the radiant purity of his vision. That indeed is the message of both
these books.
