   Quoth the raven, ``out,'' ``help,'' ``come
on, let's go'' and ``let me out'' _ but never ``nevermore.''
   The two-pound bird with a 2{-foot wingspan arrived Thursday at
the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium from San Jose, Calif.
   ``Out!'' cried the raven when bird trainer Barbara Osborn
released it from a traveling kennel into a large cage.
   The bird was turned over to the Humane Society last September by
a woman who reportedly adopted it illegally as a nestling or an
unhatched egg, then found it more than she could handle.
   The bird was uncomfortable except in human company and even
scared of crows, so society officials contacted the Non-Releasable
Animal Placement Program in Texas, which advertised the bird's
needs in its newsletter. Officials at Point Defiance, who had been
hoping to add a raven to the zoo's population, responded.
   The raven has been dubbed Poe or Poette, depending on its sex,
which zoo biologists have yet to determine. Unlike the raven in the
famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe, however, this bird never says
``nevermore.''

   Johnny Fever doesn't work there and
the musical format is country instead of rock 'n roll, but WKRP is
on the air again.
   WNVI-AM in North Vernon, a town of 6,000 people, has adopted the
call letters of the fictional radio station in the 1970s television
comedy ``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   ``Everybody's heard of WKRP,'' said station manager Shawn Lynch.
However, only listeners in and around Jennings County will be able
to hear the 1,000-watt station.
   WNVI management jumped at the chance to capitalize on the name
recognition when the last WKRP, in Dallas, Ga., decided to change
its name. Federal Communications Commission regulations allow just
one station at a time to have the call letters.
   The station ushered in its new name April 1 by duplicating a
``WKRP in Cincinnati'' episode that featured a turkey drop from an
airplane.
   ``Instead of live turkeys, we dropped a helium-filled,
turkey-shaped balloon over the high school, where they were playing
a ball game,'' Lynch said.

   Some Farmers Branch police officers
were blue about being dressed in brown, so city officials shelled
out some of the green stuff for spiffy new uniforms.
   Police in the Dallas suburb had complained that they were often
mistaken for security guards because of their brown uniforms _ even
by police in surrounding cities.
   The television series ``Hill Street Blues'' didn't help morale
much.
   And then there were all the cars in the area with bumper
stickers reading ``Back the Blue,'' part of a public campaign to
support the blue-clad Dallas police following a series of officers'
deaths.
   City Manager Ron Escalante's suggestion box brimmed with
proposals that the police change their uniforms, and City Council
responded by voting to spend more than $23,000 to buy blue
uniforms, which are expected to be ready next month.
   ``It's been the biggest morale boost we could ever have given
them,'' said city spokeswoman Donna Huerta.
