"Suddenly there came a tapping, as if someone gently rapping, rapping at my 
chamber door." Yo.

Edgar Allan Poe, meet Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone took a detour during filming of "Rocky V" to visit the Edgar Allan Poe 
National Historic Site, a house where the poet and short-story writer lived for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Park ranger Joelle Wagner said last week that she answered a knock at the 
locked front door Feb. 12 to find the creator of movie hero Rocky Balboa on the 
doorstep with co-star Talia Shire and a bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was flabbergasted," she said. "I had to take a few moments to compose 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
As the group toured the three-story structure, one of four houses Poe rented 
while living in Philadelphia from 1838 to 1844, Stallone told Wagner he had 
written a movie script about the author of the poem "The Raven." 
</P>
<P>
"He's just in awe of Poe," Wagner said. "He said he really admired him." 
</P>
<P>
Stallone, the lead in such action movies as "Rambo" and "Tango and Cash," did 
not say if he wanted to portray Poe, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Poe's works are "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Black Cat," and 
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue," which established the mystery or detective 
short-story form.
