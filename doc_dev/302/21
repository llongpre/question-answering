The Mystery Writers of America, formed in 1945, is the senior organization of 
crime writers in this country. Its annual Edgar awards (named, of course, for 
Edgar Allan Poe, who is generally saluted as the founding father of the form) 
are the most prestigious in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 awards, presented at a formal banquet last week at the start of a 
three-day ingathering of mystery authors, editors and publishers, confirmed the 
range of work that falls under the umbrella of "mystery," from a Broadway 
musical to traditional puzzles and hard-edged works heavy on social realism 
rather than arsenic at the vicarage. The prevailing tone was a cheerful feeling 
that the public's appetite for mystery in all its guises is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence includes the frequent appearance of mystery writers on the 
best-seller lists: P. D. James, Ruth Rendell, Tony Hillerman, Mary Higgins 
Clark, Dick Francis, Joseph Wambaugh and others whose works are technically 
thrillers rather than mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing popularity of "Murder, She Wrote" and the "Mystery" series on PBS 
is also heartening to the mystery trade. The committee that chose the Edgar for 
best mystery motion picture deliberated among 51 titles (some candidates 
indubitably far-fetched). The numbers in other categories were equally 
impressive: 75 candidates for best first mystery novel, 220 entries for best 
novel, 60 young adult mysteries, more than 600 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best novel went to James Lee Burke for his "Black Cherry Blues," 
set partly in Louisiana, where Burke has lived, and partly in Montana, where 
Burke now lives. It features his series character, a former New Orleans cop 
named Dave Robicheaux, who first appeared in "The Neon Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Burke, a one-time Los Angeles Skid Row social worker, writes with poetic 
intensity about a very real and often ugly world. His stories develop a double 
suspense because Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic whose struggles to stay 
dry despite the tensions and frustrations of the case at hand are painful but 
heartening. 
</P>
<P>
Burke has also written four non-mystery novels and his short stories have 
appeared in the Kenyon Review and other literary journals. His work reflects 
one strain of present mystery writing, toughly realistic but compassionate, 
entertaining in the hard-edge tradition but qualifying as a work of social 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Men outnumbered women among the winners, yet it seems significant that three of 
the five nominees for best first mystery novel were women, including Los 
Angeles' Melodie Johnson Howe, a former Universal contract player whose "The 
Mother Shadow" was very well reviewed. The winner was "The Last Billable Hour" 
by Susan Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a significant trend in the mystery field, it is the increasing 
frequency and popularity of mysteries by women, with women as protagonists, 
like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, taking over Ross Macdonald's Santa Barbara 
beat, and Sara Peretsky's V. I. Warshawski, finding crime and social problems 
going hand in hand in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys have suggested that perhaps one published mystery in four is 
written by a woman. Yet the ratio seems deceptive, probably because women 
historically and today have been disproportionately successful in the field, 
from the days of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery 
Allingham in England, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Mignon Eberhart and several others 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
This is Christie's centenary year -- she was born in 1890 and died in 1976 -- 
and there will be elaborate observances in England and elsewhere. Her 84 books 
continue to sell in innumerable languages and to find new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's grandson, Matthew Pritchard, who oversees the ongoing sales and 
productions of her work, was an honored guest at the awards banquet and at a 
90-minute seminar Saturday on the durability of Christie's work. 
</P>
<P>
She was, the panelists agreed, an unparalleled puzzle maker, especially 
ingenious at diverting the reader's eye from the culprit yet making the 
ultimate revelation inevitable rather than arbitrary. As one of the panelists 
said, the reader's reaction is most often: "Fooled again, but fairly." 
</P>
<P>
It is a kind of conjuring trick, and Pritchard noted that his grandmother was 
fascinated by magic tricks and in fact briefly employed a butler whose gifts 
included performing magic. 
</P>
<P>
The question often asked at gatherings of mystery writers and readers is why 
the form should have such a continuing and evidently growing popularity. Prof. 
B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, an expert on P. D. James, Ruth Rendell and other 
English writers, thinks that the charm of the mystery is that restores order 
after chaos, in a world that sometimes appears increasingly chaotic. It also 
metes out justice in a world where justice is not always seen to be done. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional puzzle mystery was escapist fare, ideal for train rides, 
hammocks and sleepless nights. Yet even the escapist fare, Rahn says, reflected 
its times. Christie's characters, said Mary Higgins Clark, who chaired the 
seminar, were not stereotypes but prototypes, and they reveal the times 
Christie lived in and the places she knew, from English villages to 
archeological digs where she spent a month each summer with her husband Max 
Mallowan. 
</P>
<P>
What Edgar Allan Poe began, Arthur Conan Doyle and Christie made a worldwide 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The other Edgar winners included Jack Olsen's "Doc: The Rape of the Town of 
Lowell," as best fact crime book. Norman Sherry's "The Life of Graham Green, 
Volume I: 1904-1939" was the best critical or biographical study. The Larry 
Gelbart/Cy Coleman/David Zippel musical "City of Angels," won an Edgar as best 
mystery play. (It was also the only nomination.) 
</P>
<P>
Keith Peterson's "The Rain" was chosen the best paperback original mystery. 
Surprisingly, the Edgar for best motion picture went to "Heathers," a blackish, 
brackish comedy thriller about murderous and suicidal games among high 
schoolers. The runners-up were Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Sea of 
Love," "True Believer" and "Licence to Kill," the most recent James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
A special Raven award went to Carol Brener, for her tenure as owner of the 
pioneering Manhattan mystery book shop, Murder, Ink. 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Writer's Grand Master award for an entire body of work went this 
year to Helen McCloy, now 86, who published her first mystery in 1938.
