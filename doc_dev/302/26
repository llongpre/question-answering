   Canadian marathon swimmer Vicki Keith, still
tired from crossing the English Channel two weeks ago, had to
abandon her effort to butterfly from Santa Catalina Island to the
mainland after 19 hours.
   ``I don't consider this a failure,'' she said. ``I figure I just
went out there and gave it my best shot.''
   Keith's support crew persuaded her to quit after the exhausted
and hallucinating athlete gained less than half a mile in the last
eight hours Friday, said crew member Craig Williams.
   She had covered more than 18 of the 24 miles across the San
Pedro Channel when she gave in.
   Keith thought that a huge tanker was inches from her as she
swam, Williams said. Hallucinations are normal for her during
marathon swims, he said, but not until she's been in the water for
36 hours.
   The 28-year-old schoolteacher mastered all five of the Great
Lakes last summer and raised more than $550,000 for a Toronto
sports training and fitness center and a children's aquatic center.
   This summer she made the 42-mile English Channel crossing and
swam 14 miles across Australia's Sydney Harbor, also in marathons
associated with children's charities.

   LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. (AP) _ After an insult from a
much-younger man, old pro wrestler Buddy ``Nature Boy'' Rogers
added some injury.
   A 30-year-old rowdy picked on the wrong old man, police said
last week. Rogers, 68, had just ordered lunch in a sandwich shop
when Theodore Terhune of Pompano Beach burst in looking for someone
named Mike.
   When he was told Mike wasn't there, he began verbally abusing a
pair of employees, police said, and Rogers asked him to quiet down.
   ``He called me an old man,'' said Rogers, in his day the star of
the pro wrestling circuit and still powerfully built. ``He said:
`If you want a piece of me, you can have me right now.'
   ``I pushed him against a wall and he picked up a chair and threw
it at me,'' Rogers said. ``Then I unloaded. I gave him a shot and
he must have flown five feet into a refrigerator. Then I nailed him
in the stomach, and he flew into the kitchen.''

   Director George Romero is back at the scene of
his first, 1968 horror classic, ``The Night of the Living Dead,''
to make his 11th feature film.
   ``Now it's sort of become a signature. I'm known as that guy who
works in Pittsburgh,'' he said recently during filming of ``The
Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.''
   ``Anything's cheaper than New York or (Los Angeles), but that's
not really the factor,'' Romero said. ``It's a varied kind of look.
All people don't want their films to have palm trees in them.''
   Filming of ``M. Valdemar,'' starring Adrienne Barbeau, Ramy Zada
and E.G. Marshall, started July 10 and is scheduled to conclude
Aug. 5.
   The film is an adaptation of a short story by Edgar Allan Poe
and will be teamed with another adaptation of a Poe story, ``The
Black Cat,'' and released under the title ``Two Evil Eyes.''
   ``I grew up with Poe. I've always had an affinity for the genre.
Even as a kid, those were the movies that I watched and the comic
books I read, and Poe was the only author I could actually read in
school and get my kicks,'' said Romero.

   Cowboy singer Rex Allen hasn't got a case
against the late Slim Pickens or the actor's family or estate
because of injuries he sustained at Pickens' Wyoming cabin, the
state's Supreme Court ruled.
   The singer sued for damages for loss of sight in one eye
following a 1983 fall, but the court said Friday there was no
negligence on the part of Pickens.
   Allen slipped on overgrown grass partly covering steps to the
cabin while looking for a key Pickens had at one time told him was
hidden. At the time of the accident, Pickens was seriously ill in
California.
   In upholding a summary judgment that had gone against Allen in
lower court, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the Pickens
family nor the actor's estate was responsible for maintaining the
cabin for unexpected guests.

   Philadelphia Orchestra music director
Riccardo Muti has been named an honorary ambassador by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the orchestra reported.
   The formal announcement was made Saturday in Salzburg, Austria,
by U.N. High Commissioner Jean-Pierre Hocke. Muti, who is also
music director of Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy, immediately
announced two benefit concerts to be held in 1990 in Milan and in
1991 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.
   Muti's acceptance is a public commitment to the ``defense of
human rights and to the cause of the world's 14 million refugees
whose basic human rights have been threatened,'' said Bonnie
Arnold, orchestra spokeswoman.
   ``If we look at history, artists of all kinds, painters,
scluptors, writers and musicians have always been amongst the most
influential and the most deeply involved members of society,'' Muti
said in Salzburg.
