   The man who disarmed the Lone Ranger will be
spending lots of time around horses, but he'll be cleaning up after
the animals rather than riding them.
   Edward Louis Young III, convicted of stealing pistols owned by
Jack Carlson ``Clayton'' Moore, was sentenced to spend 600 hours
cleaning up after the horses at the Houston Mounted Patrol's
stables.
   The task could take 2{ years if Young spends 20 hours a month
shoveling manure at the Houston Mounted Patrol's stables.
   Judge Ted Poe said the punishment was fitting for the theft of
the weapons from the hero who's been bringing evil outlaws to
justice on television and in movies for a half-century.
   Poe also sentenced Young on Tuesday to a month in Harris County
Jail and placed him on probation for 10 years.
   Young, a 45-year-old former airline baggage handler, was
convicted of stealing Moore's chrome-plated, twin Colt .45-caliber
revolvers at Houston Intercontinental Airport on Dec. 24, 1986. An
appeals court recently upheld the conviction.
   ``I carry no animosity and I'm certainly a believer in law and
order, and one thing for sure, the Ten Commandments,'' Moore said
Wednesday from his California home. ``And one of those is `Thou
shalt not steal.'''
   Moore was signing autographs the airport when his bags
disappeared.
   Aside from two U.S. Customs inspectors, Young was the only other
person in the baggage area when Moore's luggage and guns were
stolen. Young was apprehended after police traced him as the person
who sold the weapons at a jewelry and gold exchange. He contended
someone had sold him the pistols and holsters for $200 outside a
pawn shop.
   Young's lawyer based his appeal on insufficient evidence and the
fact that Poe let the Lone Ranger wear his sunglasses and white hat
while testifying.
   Poe, who often wears cowboy boots under his judge's robe in
court, said he had no intention of ordering Moore to remove his
trademark hat.
   ``I wasn't about to be the one who revealed the identity of the
Lone Ranger,'' Poe joked. ``Outlaws have been trying to find it out
for years.''
