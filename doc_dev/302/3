   One of the six Philadelphia homes of author
and poet Edgar Allan Poe was designated a National Literary
Landmark on Sunday because of its importance in the writer's career.
   Jeff Collins, acting supervisory ranger at the Edgar Allan Poe
National Historic Site, said the house is the only one remaining of
Poe's houses in Philadelphia, where he lived from 1838 to 1844.
   Poe's time in Philadelphia is considered among his most
productive, Collins said. ``Most of his famous works were published
here,'' he said.
   They included ``The Tell-Tale Heart,'' ``The Murders in the Rue
Morgue,'' ``The Gold Bug,'' ``The Pit and the Pendulum,'' and ``The
Black Cat,'' said Collins. However, it is not known whether Poe
actually composed those works while living in Philadelphia because
his manuscripts weren't dated.
   The historical site, which became part of Independence National
Historical Park in 1981, includes the house he rented and a
neighbor's house.
   The Literary Landmarks Association is a Columbus, Ohio-based
group that designates sites important to the lives of famous
authors.
   Poe was born in Boston in 1809 and died in Baltimore in 1849.
