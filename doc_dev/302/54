Steven Berkoff is one great rampant ego. His energy is terrific, and every
scrap of it is ploughed into showing off. Both in motion and in speech, he
draws maximum attention to his own method of performance. Yet the more you
attend to the way he performs, the harder it becomes to take in what he is
performing. His current solo show, One Man - which has just opened (after
its Edinburgh Festival Fringe outing) at the Garrick - consists of three
different 'acts'. In none of them, however, has his style any depth. All is
flashy, over-elaborate surface.
Berkoff's art is one of cartoon-like over-emphasis. The point of his
sketches, like Monty Python's, is that they go into overkill. But no Python
performer was ever so self-regarding or relentlessly cynical as this. One of
this evening's three sketches is The Actor, in which, like a failed actor
keeping fit, he jogs into a whirlpool: a non-stop downward spiral of going
to auditions, ringing his agent, losing his wife, visiting his parents,
meeting fellow-actors and bitching about those in employment behind their
backs. Parts of the audience are amused by this far from original vision of
an actor's life as an endless round of malice, hypocrisy, envy, and panic.
The dominant impression, however, is of the non-stop jogging-on-the-spot
many-voiced virtuosity that Berkoff expends on it. His combination of
technical bravura and spite is loathsome.
Worse is the version of Edgar Allen Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart which forms
the evening's opening half. Here Berkoff embroiders Poe's narration of
furtive but gruesome murder and paranoia with an endless array of
actorliness. He changes voice and accent several times in mid-sentence; he
repeats the word 'stealthily' seven times while (a) diminishing it into
silence (b) exaggerating the oral gesture of saying it; he demonstrates 20
different ways of laughing (in series); and so forth. When a police siren is
heard outside the theatre, he incorporates that too into his act - with such
relish, and in such a studied way, that you realise he welcomes such
intrusions as a way of showing off further.
Dog, with which Berkoff closes this programme, is the least irritating. Here
he is a lager lout and his killer mastiff; and here at last his cartoon-type
method has some comic success - mainly in the throttled rage with which he
invests the dog. As long as he is busy alternating between personae, Dog
keeps Berkoff out of his usual love of excess. But here too there are
passages when Berkoff paints the lily, then gilds it, and finally then
shoves knobs on it. These occur when Berkoff cannot suppress his naturally
adolescent love of gruesomeness - as when he mimes vomiting until he mimes
swimming through his own vomit; or (in Tell-Tale Heart) when he mimes
hacking through each different fibre of the corpse. All that energy, and all
of it pumping into a form of self-display both decadent (in its love of
excess) and immature.
