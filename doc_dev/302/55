IN THE past four years, more books have been written on doing business with
Eastern Europe than there has been business. This may be about to change.
Privatisation has given a jump-start to local capital markets, and increased
the opportunities for foreign investment.
Books on the region have begun to reflect this new atmosphere, although most
still fall into the turgid tome or 'Let's Go To Moscow' variety. Here is a
round-up of the new books on offer.
                         *      *      *
Despite the silly title, Richard Poe's How to Profit from the Coming Russian
Boom (McGraw Hill, Dollars 24.95, 289 pages) is the perfect book for your
next flight to Moscow. It captures the excitement of working in Russia these
days (what Poe calls 'the honky-tonk air of a boomtown in the Klondike'),
without minimising the danger and difficulty of embarking on a Russian
commercial venture. The book is lively, fun to read, and a useful guide to
doing business.
The book is intended to help the would-be businessman manoeuvre around
Russia. Poe, a journalist, proffers lots of practical, anecdotal advice on
how westerners can make the most of the opportunities. The book provides
information on key industries and regions of the CIS: location; production;
imports and exports; true conditions (good and bad). Poe points out that
Russians do not need 'everything', and he identifies the products and
services that are in demand.
The hyperbole can be irritating. 'Russia is putting on the auction block the
largest store of undervalued stocks ever marketed in history.' 'Prices have
hit rock bottom. They have nowhere to go but up.' Nonetheless, he explains
the privatisation process in plain English. While his optimism may be
premature, there is no doubt that the new commodity and stock exchanges
trading in vouchers offer an unprecedented opportunity for western investors
 -which this book is the first to mention.
Europeans may find the book too American and a tad flippant, but it is worth
Dollars 25 (Pounds 16). Published in July 1993, it should be up-to-date for
another year, by which time, no doubt, the enterprising Mr Poe will have
graced us with a second edition.
                         *      *      *
At the other end of the spectrum - dated and of limited practical value -
the CBI Initiative Eastern Europe has published Doing Business in Russia
(Kogan Page, Pounds 25, 284 pages). Written by a hodgepodge of contributors
(ALM Consulting, Frere Cholmeley Bischoff, KPMG Peat Marwick, British Gas,
et al) the book attempts to lay out the current legal and economic framework
for British business entering the Russian market.
Written from a theoretical rather than a practical perspective, the book
covers topics such as foreign exchange, privatisation, property, and
distributor networks. The best sections are the chapter on banking (written
by Moscow Narodny Bank), which provides useful names and addresses of banks
throughout the region, and the chapter on dispute resolution, which
clarifies the procedures in this complex area.
The main problem is that the book is based on laws and information prior to
January 1993. A lot has changed since then, points out Mr Gilberto Sanchez,
an economic adviser to the Russian Ministry of Privatisation. Most notably,
4000 medium and large enterprises have been privatised so far this year,
versus none last year. Nor does the book explain the opaque system for
getting hold of real estate, which is a critical hurdle for British
retailers wishing to set up in Moscow. The sections on export licenses and
exchange rates are completely out-of-date.

The Baltic States present a different challenge from Russia, and Richard
Abbott's Doing Business in the Baltic States (Kogan Page, Pounds 30 254
pages) is a reasonable starting point for those considering an investment.
Abbott is a consultant specialising in the Baltics; his book contains lots
of bread-and-butter information buried in a style that is rather dull.
Abbott makes a good case for investing in the Baltics - why, he wonders, is
there so much enthusiasm for doing business in Hungary and the Czech
Republic while the Baltics get lumped with Moldova and Kyrgyzstan? After
all, the Baltics have an excellent geographical position, 8m westernised
citizens, democracy, and a large trading and manufacturing base which needs
foreign investment.
The book is divided into three parts: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. For
each state, Abbott reviews recent history, the economic base,
infrastructure, foreign investment laws, and basic information on the local
market. Although it is based on pre-February 1993 information, this is less
of a drawback than it is for the Doing Business in Russia because there are
so many fewer sources of information about the Baltics.

For more academic reading, the prolific Roman Frydman, Andrzej Rapaczynski,
and John Earle have produced two more volumes in their 1993 series - The
Privatisation Process in Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic States (Oxford
University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 290 pages) and The Privatization
Process in Central Europe (Oxford University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 276
pages) which explains privatisation in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, and Romania.
The authors are distinguished professors, and these are serious books for
serious students of the privatisation process. Rapaczynski is a close friend
of Andre Schleifer, the Harvard University professor who is virtually
directing privatisation in Russia. These books will find a place on the
reading lists for courses on modern Russian political economy, not on
airport bookshelves.
The Central European volume is better, primarily because it was written
after much of the privatisation effort was well under way, particularly in
Poland and Hungary. This makes it possible for the authors to comment on the
programmes more fully.
The Russia book, just published, provides one of the first academic
critiques of the privatisation scheme. Ukrainian privatisation is still in
its infancy, however, so there is not much to say. While it is interesting
to contrast the techniques used in Russia and the other countries, what we
really need is another book - preferably in about two years - analysing the
success of the different approaches to privatisation.

Finally, from Ljubljana, in Slovenia, an academic team have produced Foreign
Investment in Central and Eastern Europe (edited by Patrick Artisien, Matija
Rojec and Marjan Svetlicic, Macmillan, Pounds 40, 206 pages), a study of
foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region to date.
The authors and contributors analyse the extent to which each country has
attracted FDI and is likely to do so in future. Conclusion: large western
companies have committed very little, in real terms, in spite of all the
noise and signing of joint ventures. This brings us back to the first book
in this review. Richard Poe sees the lack of western investment as a huge
opportunity for the entrepreneur - a once-in-a-century chance to compete
with the cautious multinationals and profit from the coming Russian boom.
