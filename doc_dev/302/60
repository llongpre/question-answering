The proposed city of Sunset Hills in the Santa Clarita Valley would not be 
financially sound and should not be incorporated, according to a report 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the staff of the Local Agency Formation Commission, 
also questioned the value of launching a second city in the valley, noting that 
the city of Santa Clarita is only two years old and is still working out plans 
for its future. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for an additional city in the Santa Clarita Valley has not been 
demonstrated," the report said. LAFCO, which oversees incorporations and 
annexations, has scheduled a hearing on the cityhood proposal June 27. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Director Ruth Benell said the proposed 27.8-square-mile city -- 
now mostly vacant land west of the Golden State Freeway, inhabited by 1,701 
residents -- does not have the industrial base to provide public services. 
Except for a few fast-food restaurants and a hotel, the only major commercial 
enterprise is Six Flags Magic Mountain, which opposes the cityhood plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think it's a viable proposal," Benell said. She noted that 
the cityhood plan is opposed by Newhall Land and Farming Co., which owns 19.5 
square miles in the proposed city, 70% of its territory. 
</P>
<P>
A LAFCO study found that Sunset Hills would amass yearly budget deficits from 
$275,000 to almost $500,000 during the first four years of cityhood. In the 
world of municipal government, the deficits would be relatively small but would 
not justify incorporation, Benell said. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood drive was launched by Jeff Stevenson, a vice president of Dale Poe 
Development Corp., and Ernest Dynda, a former member of the Agoura Hills City 
Council. Dale Poe is building the giant Stevenson Ranch development that would 
be the heart of the proposed city and has expressed concerns about slow-growth 
movements in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Hills is an excellent candidate for cityhood because the residents could 
plan their city from its birth, creating their own identity in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood proposal was submitted to LAFCO last fall shortly before the 
commission considered a request by Santa Clarita that would have made Sunset 
Hills eligible for annexation by Santa Clarita. LAFCO turned down Santa 
Clarita's request, citing the Sunset Hills incorporation movement in its 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
Angry Santa Clarita officials blasted the LAFCO denial and bitterly labeled 
Sunset Hills "Poe-dunk." Mayor Jo Anne Darcy pledged to fight Sunset Hills 
cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Benell said the Sunset Hills cityhood campaign was partly driven by the desire 
to keep the area out of Santa Clarita. "I'm not sure how serious the proponents 
of the proposal were" about creating their own city, Benell said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson partially agreed. "I don't want to be in the city of Santa Clarita at 
this time," he said. Even if LAFCO denies cityhood for Sunset Hills at the 
hearing this month, the commission should "preserve our right to decide our own 
destiny" and keep Sunset Hills out of Santa Clarita, he said.
