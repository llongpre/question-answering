BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (18) Francis Coppola
MIDNIGHT STING (15) Michael Ritchie
ANNABELLE PARTAGEE (18) Francesca Comencini
TRIPLE BOGEY ON A PAR FIVE HOLE Amos Poe
Bloodsucking Counts can seldom count on long hibernations between movie
crazes. Or between those cyclical cries of commentators that a newer, truer,
sexier vampire has been born. It is only 12 years, by my guttering candle,
since silken-tongued Frank Langella's Dracula, presiding over a pack of
vampire films, was acclaimed for putting the sex back into the story. Gary
Oldman for Francis Coppola is now acclaimed for doing the same in Bram
Stoker's Dracula.
But when was sex ever out of the story? Stoker's novel is as Freudian as a
pre-Freudian text could be. Apart from the cinema's first great Blood Count,
the bat-eared, rat-toothed Max Schreck in Nosferatu, every new prince of
darkness has been acclaimed for re-eroticising the role. Bela Lugosi made
women swoon; Christopher Lee hissed out sex appeal as starlets dropped like
flies; and now Oldman's metamorphic seducer, inducing orgasms in his women
as pollen induces sneezing, is hailed for  - yes - putting the sex back into
Stoker.
Certainly something is being put into Stoker. Coppola directs as if he has
been sitting on a Pandora's box of pictorial invention since The Godfather.
Out fly wild painted mountain scapes, shadows that move independently of
their owners, giant diary pages embossed on blood-red landscapes, snuffling
Steadicams snaking through undergrowth, blood-weltered monsters flung
against walls and becoming an army of rats, and an anti-hero who changes
guise as often as - well, as Coppola himself in the most protean career any
major film-maker ever had.
Do we detect a hint of self-portraiture, even unwitting? After Godfather III
 -Corleone-Coppola as King Lear - here is Coppola as the tragic prince: a
demonised hero seeking love (the admiration of movie audiences) through the
doomy blur of an ineluctable blood-lust (commercial mandates of money-mad
film industry). Far-fetched? Nonsense. It is as tenable a theory as any
other now being flung about in the climate of out-with-the-essay pens, here
comes Dracula again. The reason everyone thinks Coppola's film has put the
sex back into Stoker is because it has put the sensual elan back into
Coppola.
The film is an education in lyrical chaos. The first six days of Creation
must have been something like this: magnificent, disorderly, terrifying,
stroboscopic. Writer James V. Hart (of Hook) claims his screenplay is true
to the untapped inspirational founts in Stoker's original: he has talked
about warrior princes fallen from grace and Victorian sexuality put on the
psychiatrist's couch. But the script seems muddled and multi-directional to
me, and it majors in gauche dialogue. Are we supposed to giggle when Anthony
Hopkins's Van Helsing outlines to the dead Lucy's grieving fiance his
post-funeral arrangements: 'I just want to cut off her head and take out her
heart.'
Coppola cuts off the script's head and puts in some art. Base matter is duly
set boiling with being. As Apocalypse Now rearranged the face of nature,
weaving man's own features into the jungle vistas, this Dracula makes the
landscape symbiotic with the living beings. Keanu Reeves's amiably callow
Jonathan Harker, a hero-narrator lost in his story like Martin Sheen up the
Mekong, finds Dracula-Kurtz in his lair and stumbles on the great Gothic
secret of existence. This is: that the average fearful human being, unnerved
enough by life before death, is horribly afraid that there is life after
death and lots of it.
So Gary Oldman's Count is an appetite incarnate, an Id that clothes itself
in different guises. He dies in mediaeval Romania, an armadillo-armoured
warrior. He rises to meet Reeves as an ageing, monster-wigged dandy with
mutinous shadow. And later he mutates into a frockcoated dark-glassed
seducer, a wolf, and a ravening bat-monster.
Portrait of the film-maker as rabid quick-change artist; and portraits of
the audience as his willingly terrified victims. As Count Coppola ravishes
our senses with some of the most beautifully haywire scene-painting since
Hieronymus Bosch, Count Oldman taps the tuning fork of his lust, pitched to
the human scream, on demure Mina (Winona Ryder) and not-so-demure Lucy
(Sadie Frost).
Yes, the film is foolish in its drawing-room scenes: all gowns, dinner
jackets and Brit accents waiting to be savaged by the primitive. But two
scenes leap towards brilliance. one, the dark-glassed Count ushers Mina off
a London street into an early kinematograph show, where literal ravishment
is rhymed with the aesthetic ravishment of a screen train rumbling towards a
screaming audience. In the other, the massed band of heroes and heroines
gallops over midnight crags to their revenge rendezvous at Dracula's castle,
in a paint-and-matte sequence as kinetic as a Saturday matinee serial and as
richly-coloured as one of the Corman-Poe films on which Coppola served his
apprenticeship.
Beside sequences like these, the putting-the-sex-back-into-Stoker passages
seems tired and dutiful. Here an orgasm, there a rape; somewhere else a
frolic with three nude devil-maidens, born out of giant bedsheets like the
Rhinemaidens in the time-tunnel Ring. No, the sex is an old old story. What
makes this Dracula special is the hand and eye of a great film-maker playing
God, in the few interludes when the script and its post-Freudian
prescriptions allow him to.
The delightful Midnight Sting, despite title, has no night-walking creatures
sinking sharp body-parts into their victims. Unless you count con man and
ex-con James Woods, his brain honed to a point by years of gainful
imposture. Fresh from jail, he is determined to give Diggstown ('the rural
capital of cash fighting') and its owner Bruce Dern, who won the town after
a crooked bet, a boxing night to remember. Woods puts up ex-prizefighter Lou
Gossett Jr, a sagging-chested 48, and wagers that he will win ten fights in
a row against local comers.
Seconds out. Ring bell. Roll camera. Director Michael Ritchie (The
Candidate, Smile), adapting a Leonard Wise novel, gives the all-day boxathon
the right Rockyish rubato of slow builds and sudden flurries. And this tale
of a ringside 'sting' has a cunning sting in its own tail. But the real
prize-fight happens outside the arena: in the three-way play-off between the
stars. Woods is a human dynamo, all fizzing wires and switch-on smiles;
Gossett is a cunning old bear lumbering after new honeypots; and Dern, with
his roguish rodent charm, does more expressive things with his teeth than
Dracula ever dreamt of.
Elsewhere it is desperation week at the cinema. Avoid Francesca Comencini's
Annabelle Partagee , a French film about l'amour in which l'ennui takes over
early on. And send only those moviegoing friends time-warped in the 1960s to
Amos Poe's Triple Bogey On A Par Five Hole. The shaggy-dog title denotes a
shaggy-dog film: four characters drifting round New York in a yacht while a
fifth (Eric Mitchell) tries to unravel their mystery-prone family history.
Deeply minimalist, deeply minimal.
It is never too late to say goodbye, and Audrey Hepburn deserves a last
bouquet from a lasting admirer. She was a star for a simple reason. She had
a beautiful face and a beautiful voice but there was an enchanting mismatch
between the two. The features belonged to a free-as-air pixie, but the voice
was husky and choked as though the pixie had strayed to earth and drunk too
much champagne. Hence her prowess in mournful-funny princess roles: from
Roman Holiday to War And Peace, Breakfast At Tiffanys to My Fair Lady. Her
serious, giddy naturalism seemed modern 40 years ago and still seems fresh
when viewed today.
