With disturbing regularity, novels and textbooks are yanked from school 
classrooms across the nation, because someone somewhere finds them 
objectionable. Yet a recent survey found that nearly one-quarter of the school 
districts in California have no formal policies to deal with such objections. 
</P>

Attacks upon great literature for young adults and children are nothing new -- 
from "Catcher in the Rye" to "Little Red Riding Hood." The advocacy group 
People for the American Way documented 244 book challenges in the 1989-90 
school year, and California accounted for almost one-third of those. 
Unfortunately, it's such fertile ground for controversy that each school 
district in the state now needs to have a clear and well-defined policy of how 
to handle, (and fend off most) objections to school reading materials. 
</P>
<P>
A nonchalant attitude about preserving precious freedoms too often creates an 
atmosphere that encourages censorship. The most pressing danger is that school 
officials will simply remove a book from a library or a class curriculum rather 
than debate its merits. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of formal policies likely results in "preemptive" censorship, said 
Louise Adler, an education professor at Cal State Fullerton who conducted the 
recent survey. "It means that either a district will not give someone a fair 
hearing, or someone will just remove a text without really considering what 
should be done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An example of such a "preemptive strike" was cited in People for the American 
Way's annual censorship report. A school official in La Puente requested that 
Edgar Allan Poe's "The Black Cat" be removed from a ninth-grade classroom, 
because the official was afraid that someone would object to a picture of a 
hanging cat that accompanied the famous short story. So in a move to avoid 
controversy, the book was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Such a chilling incident is all the more reason why every school district 
should have clear procedures for logging objections to school reading 
materials. That way, protesters can be heard -- but their angry voices alone 
will not be enough to cower supporters of the intellectual freedom on which 
this nation was built.
