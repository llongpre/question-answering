   Pulitzer Prize-winning author William
Styron was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal for his
lifetime achievements Sunday, but told the audience he wasn't sure
such honors should be necessary.
   ``Are prizes necessary or even desirable?'' the author of
``Sophie's Choice'' asked the crowd of 800 at the 450-acre
MacDowell artists' colony. ``Shouldn't the satisfaction of one's
work be sufficient reward?''
   Styron, who joins 28 previous medalists including Leonard
Bernstein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Alexander Calder and John Updike,
noted that his American literary ancestors never had to deal with
the egos and competition involved in prize winning.
   ``No medals for Edgar Allan Poe, no medals for (Nathaniel)
Hawthorne, no medals for (Walt) Whitman. No medals, no prizes, no
annual publisher's award, no seal of approval, no fellowships or
grants,'' Styron said.
   Yet Styron, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for ``The
Confessions of Nat Turner'' and the American Book Award for
``Sophie's Choice,'' said he found the medal ``one of the purest
awards for artistic achievement in the United States'' because it
was judged by Updike, Norman Mailer and other prominent authors.
   Previous award winners ``represent the brightest constellation
of talent that could be assembled in the late half of this
century,'' Styron said.
   Styron said he is continuing work on a novel about the Marine
Corps and on a non-fiction work based on his recent visit to
Nicaragua.
   Styron's previous works have taken on larger issues such as
racism and the Holocaust, but he called the war in Nicaragua a
shameful conflict, and said he was shocked there was ``almost no
passion or feeling on the part of American writers to try to find a
solution to it.''
   The MacDowell Colony provides private studios to painters,
sculptors, musicians and other artists. It was founded by the widow
of Edward MacDowell, a composer who died in 1908.
