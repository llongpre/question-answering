   Academy Award voters aren't likely to give it
a second look, but those who love horror Hollywood style are in for
a rare treat. Roger Corman is back.
   For the first time in nearly 20 years, the director of such B
movies as ``Attack of the Crab Monsters,'' ``Wasp Woman,''
``Teen-age Caveman'' and ``She-Gods of Shark Reef'' returned to the
movie-set hot seat.
   ``Frankenstein Unbound,'' Corman's fresh look at the classic
Mary Shelley novel, opens today. Unlike Corman's earlier low-budget
films, which featured little-known actors, ``Frankenstein Unbound''
boasts the marquee names of John Hurt, Raul Julia and Bridget
Fonda.
   Corman, 64, last directed a film, the World War I drama ``Von
Richthofen and Brown,'' in 1971.
   ``About halfway through filming it, I just realized I was
getting tired,'' Corman said in an interview. ``I had directed more
than 50 films in something like 15 or 16 years.
   ``I never intended to stop directing. What I wanted to do was
take the traditional sabbatical.''
   But it was not to be. Corman went on to produce scores of films,
including ``Boxcar Bertha,'' ``Piranha'' and ``Humanoids From the
Deep.''
   Corman is credited with giving early breaks to aspiring
Hollywood newcomers such as Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone,
Martin Scorsese, Charles Bronson and Ellen Burstyn.
   Among his better known films are ``The Masque of the Red
Death,'' ``The Tomb of Ligeia'' and ``The Raven,'' all adapted from
Edgar Allan Poe tales.
   He also made the original ``The Little Shop of Horrors,''
featuring Nicholson, in 1960.
   Corman, who co-wrote and co-produced ``Frankenstein Unbound,''
says the film budgeted at $9 million doesn't truly fit into the
horror category, though it depicts disemboweled animals,
decapitations, impalings and a gruesome monster.
   ``It's not really a horror film, not quite,'' Corman said.
``It's really a kind of science fiction-fantasy-horror with a
little bit of a moral point.''
   Corman said his two-decade absence from behind the camera
worried him at first.
   ``As we're driving out to the set for the first day of filming,
I thought, Am I really going to be able to pull this off?'' Corman
said.
   Problems surfaced quickly.
   ``We get there, the cameras weren't ready. I immediately said,
`All right, fellas. I told you I want the camera on the dolly over
here. Let's lay the track, get the camera out, that wall over there
is not dressed, let's bring in the props, let's get this thing
moving,'' he said.
   ``I didn't even think about it until somebody brought me some
coffee a few minutes later. And I realized, I'm just working again.
It's as if I had stopped working last Friday.''
   Corman says he'll direct again, but for now he's off to Europe,
where ``Frankenstein Unbound'' will the opening night feature at
the first Stockholm Film Festival.
   The onetime lord of low-budget movie fare still has an eye for a
good deal.
   ``They sent me a ticket,'' he said. ``And I figured I might as
well go.''
