<LEADPARA>  Today's quote, sprinkled with chide, comes from French director Jean-Luc
Godard, who told Newsweek: "As always when Americans have someone good, they
don't appreciate him, like Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe or Raymond
Chandler. Jerry Lewis is very amateuristic but also very professional. There
is lots of the unconscious to be seen in his work, as in all the great
artists."  </LEADPARA>
