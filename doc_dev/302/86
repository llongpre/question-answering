THE IMAGINATION OF THE HEART: THE LIFE OF WALTER DE LA MARE by Theresa
Whistler Duckworth Pounds 25, 478 pages
WALTER de la Mare had one of the longest innings of any British poet. He was
a young hopeful at the turn of the century; he was a Grand Old Man in the
1950s, a CH and an OM, having turned down the offer of a knighthood. By then
he had to his credit two massive collected volumes - Collected Poems and
Collected Rhymes and Verses (both now reissued in paperback by Faber). He
was exceptionally active as a creative writer and anthologist from his
sixties onwards, producing five volumes of poetry between 1942 and his
death, aged 83, in 1956.
When de la Mare was an obscure young man, working as a clerk in London, the
cult of Beauty associated with Oscar Wilde and his set was all the rage. One
of the photographs in Theresa Whistler's The Imagination of the Heart, an
authoritative biography gestated over many years, shows de la Mare in the
typical gilded lily attire of the aesthetic movement. When he was an old
man, a widower living at Twickenham, the cynosure of a wide circle of
friends and admirers, his dress had become casual and his publisher had
become the author of the Four Quartets, thanks to his son Richard, a
colleague of Eliot's.
Thus de la Mare was not just pre-modernist but a pre-Georgian to boot. True,
generous amounts of his work were included by his benefactor Sir Edward
Marsh in his collections of Georgian Poetry from 1912-1922, and those
best-selling anthologies helped to establish de la Mare's reputation; but
while de la Mare became friendly with other Georgians such as W H Davies,
Ralph Hodgson, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke, as a poet he remained
aloof from the movement. And he stayed staunchly his own man throughout his
working life. He inhabited a remarkably solid and impregnable ivory tower, a
place of enchantment and mystery, unsullied by ennui and sensuality, where a
mature technical mastery over language and rhyme is deployed to re-create
the innocent vision of childhood.
The ancestry of his work may be found partly in Edgar Allen Poe and also in
the anonymous tradition of the Border Ballads, whose haunting refrains and
narrative magic are echoed continually. As a poet de la Mare remained aloof
not just from poetic movements and fashions but from contemporary history.
The traumas of the 20th century are seldom reflected in poetry which seems a
delightful irrelevance once childhood is over. We feel it to be a truancy
from responsibility.
Theresa Whistler does not combat directly the view of him as a poetic
isolationist but her book helps the reader to see that there was rather more
to him than it would suggest. To begin with, he had the most almighty
struggle to become a writer at all. He won a scholarship to St Paul's Choir
School from a humble background, Huguenot by origin. Further education or
training was out of the question. He was forced to accept the option of a
clerkship in the oil business for a meagre salary under conditions worthy of
Mr Gadgrind.
Eighteen years would pass, during which he married a woman older than
himself and raised a family of four children, before he was liberated from
his office stool. During those years his working day as a poet began around
midnight. Yet poems and stories poured out of him. He seemed undaunted by
the regularity with which they were returned by the journals to which he
submitted them. In his meticulous, clerkly way he preserved every rejection
slip.
Eventually he achieved his breakthrough and a minor reputation. On the
strength of a one-off grant from the Civil List of Pounds 200 de la Mare was
able at long last to quit his job. In those days pensions for lowly
employees were unheard of and his livelihood was still precarious.
He became a staff-reader for publisher Walter Heinemann - almost as great a
form of servitude as the oil business. What saved him, ironically, was the
death of Rupert Brooke. De la Mare was one of three poets (Wilfrid Gibson
and Lascelles Abercrombie were the others) to whom Brooke left the royalty
income on his copyrights, a marvellously far-sighted gesture on Brooke's
part that makes one feel quite differently about him.
De la Mare now began to take his rightful place among the lions of
contemporary poetry. His work was favourably reviewed in the prestigious
Saturday edition of the Westminster Gazette. Its literary editor was Naomi
Royde-Smith, a woman of powerful ability and striking presence. De la Mare
met her at one of her parties and instantly fell for her. The revelation of
the biography is the passionate affair between them that ensued. Theresa
Whistler asks us to believe that it was a platonic passion, never
consummated even though the couple once spent three days entirely alone
together. She must forgive us if we remain sceptical.
At any rate, thanks to this book we can re-read de la Mare's love lyrics
knowing who inspired them. The best known ends with the line 'the sweet
cheat gone' and its structure, turning on the idea of non-consummation, is
characteristic of de la Mare's art. His even more famous anthology poem 'The
Listeners' is another instance of non-consummation. The moonlit Traveller
knocks on the door. No one answers even though he feels there is someone
there behind it. He goes away unsatisfied. It is quite clear from this book
that de la Mare had no idea what all this signified nor who 'the traveller'
was meant to be, even though he was asked hundreds of times.
In his short stories the theme is repeated again and again. Here the
traveller tends to go, not on horseback, but by train. Graham Greene, who
much admired de la Mare's tales, drew attention in a perceptive article to
the prevalence in them of the railway station as a point of departure for a
quest into the unknown. De la Mare dealt at length with unconsummated love
in the compass of a long novel, Memoirs of a Midget. In this novel the
diminutive heroine is only two feet high and we see the world entirely
through her eyes - a tour de force of invention comparable to Swift's in
Gulliver. Miss M. comes under the spell of a dazzlingly attractive
full-grown woman who shares many of the traits of Royde-Smith.
De la Mare paved the way here for the novel of magical realism. As Angela
Carter said in her preface to the Oxford Twentieth Century Classics
paperback edition of 1982: 'It may be read with a great deal of simple
enjoyment and then it sticks like a splinter in the mind'. The view that
Miss M. was a metaphor for Me or Mr de la Mare is strengthened by the full
portrait of him presented in this excellent biography.
