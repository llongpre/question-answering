<LEADPARA>  Funeral directors brought the latest in afterlife fashion -- a King Tut-style
casket. Bowlers toppled pins round-the-clock. A society of gardeners spent a
weekend discussing weeds.;    Attendance at Baltimore's convention center has
more than tripled in the last decade, boosted in part by the annual gatherings
of obscure and eccentric groups ranging from the American Sod Producers to the
Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     'Tolerance for weirdos';  "There is a certain tolerance for weirdos in this
city, but I really don't know why conventions come here," said film director
John Waters, a Baltimore resident, whose offbeat films include "Hair Spray"
and "Pink Flamingos.";    "Usually, all these horror conventions ask me to
speak. I don't know why they ask me.";    Nonetheless, the city should promote
its unique character as much as its facilities, Waters said.;    "What the
Chamber of Commerce is always pushing is the wrong thing," he said. "They
should say, 'Come to Baltimore and be shocked.' That should be their campaign.
Play up the eccentricity -- that's what the city does the best, and I mean
that in a good way, because I don't think you can fake that.";    The National
Funeral Directors Association came to town in 1989 sporting the latest in
caskets, including one shaped like Egyptian pharaoh King Tut's sarcophagus.;  
 Humor and money;  "What was so wonderful about the funeral directors is, yes,
they have a sense of humor, but they also spend a lot of money," said Kristy
Sexton of the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Center.;    Convention
officials allowed lanes to be set up in the center so a national bowlers'
group could knock down pins non-stop.;    Other conventioneers;  Other
visitors have included the Weed Society of America, the Jack and Jill Club (a
mother's group) and the Great American Firehouse Exposition and Muster, a
firefighters' convention in town last week.;    Attendance has increased
steadily since the city opened its convention center, now surrounded by 5,300
hotel rooms, in 1979. In 1980, 107,000 people attended conventions and spent
$43 million. Last year, about 350,000 delegates attended conventions, meetings
and trade shows, tourism officials said.;    Beyond the main attraction; 
Baltimore's biggest attraction remains its redeveloped Inner Harbor, but
conventioneers are discovering Edgar Allan Poe's grave, Babe Ruth's birthplace
and a downtown clock tower emblazoned with the words "Bromo Seltzer" on its
face.;    Said DeAnn Scrabeck, director of meetings for the Milwaukee-based
National Funeral Directors Association, "The city is kind of a sleeper."  </TEXT>
