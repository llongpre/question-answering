   Let's all get scared. After all, it's the season of fright, the
time to scream, the hour of the witch. Let your living room be the
den of horror for your Halloween frightfest.
   There are lots of scary movies available on video for the home
viewer. Please note that not all are for the casual viewer; many
are for hardcore horror fans.
   Here is the first part of an alphabetical list of some of what's
available on video for Halloween. Tune in next week for more:

<TEXT>
   ``The Abominable Dr. Phibes'' (1971): Vincent Price gets a nose
job and seeks revenge. With some funny bits and a little help from
Terry-Thomas, Hugh Griffin and Joseph Cotton.
   ``Alison's Birthday'' (1984): A nasty 19th birthday celebration
for Alison, who's father's ghost has warned her to stay away. Oh
well.
   ``The Amityville Horror'' (1979): Forget this borish movie.
About as frightening as Bugs Bunny in an Amusement Park. Even
worse, its two sequels.
   ``And Now the Screaming Starts'' (1973): A Peter Cushing
bloodfest. Eerie and scary British film.
   ``Angel Heart'' (1987): Very bloody, vague and occasionally
vapid. Nice cameo by Robert De Niro. More sleaze from the sleaze
king, Mickey Rourke. With Lisa Bonet and lots of violence.
   ``The Believers'' (1987): A voodoo cult runs rampant in New
York. Not bad.
   ``The Birds'' (1963): Excellent Hitchcock eerie and scary
thriller. Don't mess with your fine, feathered friends.
   ``The Black Cat'' (1934): Stylish and surrealistic scare flick
teaming Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. A bloody concept at the end,
with not much shown. Paired on video with another Karloff-Lugosi
winner, ``The Raven.'' Classics worth owning, and horror movies the
way they should be - thoughtful and unsettling.
   ``The Black Room'' (1935): Karloff as twins with family curse.
   ``Black Sabbath'' (1964): A trilogy of horror tales. Pretty good
stuff.
   ``Blood Beach'' (1981): The challenge here is to keep from
laughing as hapless beach bunnies are mysteriously sucked into the
sand and killed. A real clunker.
   ``Blood on Satan's Claw'' (1971): Satan and witchcraft in
17th-century England. A good fright.
   ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935): Not very scary, but stylish
and snappy. Stars Elsa Lanchester as the bride and Karloff as
you-know-who.
   ``Burnt Offerings'' (1976): Strange and disjointed haunted house
tale, with Bette Davis, Oliver Reed and Karen Black as the doomed
family.
   ``Cameron's Closet'' (1989): OK, you're warned. Don't go into
Cameron's closet. What you did? Oops. Not a bad supernatural
thriller. Worth a watch.
   ``Carnival of Souls'' (1962): A scary little zombie thriller set
in Kansas.
   ``Carrie'' (1976): Sloppily directed film version of
best-selling Stephen King novel, by Brian De Palma. Worth seeing
for performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.
   ``Cat People'' (1942): The curse of the panther played out in
the imagination. Well done.
   ``Cat People'' (1982): 40 years later, filmmakers decided to add
sex, nudity, an irritating synthetic soundtrack and lots and lots
of blood. Not worth the bother.
   ``Cat's Eye'' (1985): Scary story trilogy. Kind of neat.
   ``The Changeling'' (1979): Good, solid ghost story. Lots of
chills and first-rate cast: George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere,
Melvyn Douglas.
   ``Child's Play'' (1988): Watch out for your ankles and don't
play with talking dolls. Amusing and a tad disarming.
   ``Count Dracula'' (1970): Christopher Lee bares his fangs.
   ``The Crawling Eye'' (1958): Old-fashioned horror - you don't
know what's out there until the end of the movie. Scary.
   ``Curse of the Demon'' (1958): A compelling and frightening
classic about a devil cult.
   ``The Curse of the Werewolf'' (1961): Oliver Reed as the
four-legged critter.
   ``Damien: Omen II'' (1978): Damien (the Antichrist) grows up,
and the specter of death hovers over his family. Sequel to ``The
Omen.''
   ``Dawn of the Dead'' (1979): Not for the squeamish, as corpses
feast on a human buffet.
   ``Day of the Dead'' (1985): The third sequel to ``Night of the
Living Dead.'' Don't bother.
   ``Dead of Night'' (1945): A horror anthology from England, and
worth seeing on a stormy night.
   ``The Devil Doll'' (1936): Lionel Barrymore goes in drag with
his army of tiny people to seek revenge against those who destroyed
him.
   ``The Devil's Rain'' (1975): A not-so-bad movie about devil
worshippers. Stars Ernest Borgnine and Tom Skerritt.
   ``Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'' (1965): Good anthology
starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.
   ``Dracula'' (1931): The best. The very best. Bravo Lugosi.
   ``The Dunwich Horror'' (1970): Anything with Sandra Dee in it is
an automatic horror. Skip this one.
   ``The Evil'' (1978): A haunted house with Satan.
   ``The Exorcist'' (1973): Pea soup and twirling heads. Great
stuff. Skip the sequel, ``Exorcist II: The Heretic.''
   ``Fall of the House of Usher'' (1960): Vincent Price in haunted
house tale based on Edgar Allan Poe story.
   ``Frankenstein'' (1931): The Karloff classic. A real sweet,
misunderstood guy.
   ``Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' (1943): Lugosi plays Frankie
this time around. Lon Chaney Jr. reprises his Wolf Man role. Not
bad.
   ``Friday the 13th'' (and six sequels): Lighten up, Jason.
   ``Fright Night'' (1985): Sophisticated, amusing and scary
vampire tale. See it.
