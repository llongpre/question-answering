Halloween used to mean witches, jack-o'-lanterns and a safe trick or treat 
around the block. And it lasted one night. 
</P>
<P>
Lately it has turned into a major holiday rivaling the Fourth of July. Note the 
costume counters at every turn, the party goods galore. A trip to the local 
pumpkin patch seems as de rigueur as a sit-down on Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the events. Halloween has turned into an extravaganza of 
expensive costumes, lavish decorations and several days and nights of parties 
and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious event of the season is the Dragonwood Faire Autumn Festival, 
in its new location in Castaic Lake Recreation Area. A five-day celebration of 
medieval Halloween traditions, it's sort of a Renaissance Faire with witches. 
Strolling musicians, the Danse Macabre, Gypsies, scary storytelling and more 
keep the action going at every turn. Graveyards, guillotine, stocks and pillory 
stand serve as stage sets for theatrical vignettes. There will be pumpkin 
carving contests, wrapped candies for youngsters who trick or treat at the many 
craft booths, a dunk tank, maze and pony rides -- all with a medieval twist to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The costume contest (open to all fair-goers) has been divided into five 
categories: best nobility, most authentic, best fantasy, most bizarre and best 
Halloween. Proceeds benefit the Adolescent Treatment and Education Alliance, 
which deals with AIDS among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Dragonwood, take Interstate 5 north, four miles past Magic Mountain, 
to the Lake Hughes Road exit. Drive east on Ridge Route Road and follow signs. 
Admission is $8.95 for adults, $6.95 for students and seniors with ID, and 
$2.50 for children ages 5 to 12; a five-day Faire pass is $37.50. Dates are 
Oct. 27-29 and Nov. 4-5. Hours are 10 a.m. to dusk Saturdays and Sundays, noon 
to dusk Friday. Information: (213) 395-0063. 
</P>
<P>
DAY OF THE DEAD 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the history of a different culture, two events will mark the 
Mexican Day of the Dead. Jewelry, sculpture and plates will be among the 
artifacts on display in the Olvera Street Gallery, Friday through Nov. 5. The 
collection titled "Vive tu Recuerdo" ("Your Memory Is Living") is on loan from 
UCLA. Combining Aztec and Christian traditions, the Day of the Dead celebrates 
the transition from this life into the next. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display will be works by local Mexican-American artists. Workshops 
during the week will teach traditional crafts associated with the Day of the 
Dead, which is celebrated Nov. 2 in Mexico. The gallery, E-1 Olvera St., is 
open daily 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Information: (213) 628-4349. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Children's Museum will offer its own celebration of "Dia de los 
Muertos" next Saturday and Sunday with activities throughout the museum. A 
slide presentation will show a celebration in Oaxaca, and visitors can build an 
altar. Children can make offerings out of clay, taste traditional bread, sing 
songs and make puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Museum hours will be 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4; children under 2, free. 
Taped information: (213) 687-8000. The museum is at 310 N. Main St., Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
HAUNTED HOUSES 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere around the Southland, dozens of haunted houses will come to life (or 
death) on Halloween with a series of rooms and tableaux depicting ghoulish 
horrors. Although they can be a diverting alternative for parents who would 
rather skip trick or treating, most of the houses are too scary for 
preschoolers (and some impressionable elementary schoolers too). The best 
audience here is older children, teen-agers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department will have more than 20 haunted 
houses around the city. Many parks will also hold carnivals, stunt shows, 
costume parades or trick-or-treat villages as well. Most haunted houses are 
open only on Halloween for a few hours and cost $1 to tour. A few have extended 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Haunted houses are scheduled in these park recreation centers: Chevy Chase, 
Hollywood, Carlin G. Smith, Cypress, Elysian Valley, Montecito Heights, 
Yosemite, Central, Ardmore, Normandie, Branford, Victory-Vineland, Granada 
Hills, Mason, Winnetka, Encino, Peck Park, Rancho San Pedro, Wilmington,
