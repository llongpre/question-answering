<LEADPARA>  IT'S a good bet Roger Corman never dreamed he'd wind up as one of the film
makers in the Hall of Fame when he filmed "Monster From the Ocean Floor" back
in 1954.;   For that matter, Bela Lugosi probably figured he'd blown his
chance for any Halls of Fame by the time he made his last film, "Plan 9 From
Outer Space," in 1956. The film was so bad, it stayed on the shelf until 1959.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ditto for the producers of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," after seeing
people run screaming from the theater at first sight of their 1974
exploitation film.;   But there's a Hall of Fame for everyone, it seems, even
Corman, Lugosi and the chain saw gang. They've been officially inducted into
the Horror Hall of Fame, receiving the institution's highest honor, the Grim
Reaper Award. You can watch them being honored Wednesday night when Ch. 44
shows the nationally syndicated TV show commemorating the 1991 Horror Hall of
Fame.;   Launched as an annual TV special last year, the Horror Hall honors
those films, film makers, TV shows, actors and other related specialties that
every year shock the pants off millions of Americans.;   Last year's winners
included actors Vincent Price and Boris Karloff, director Alfred Hitchcock,
monster magazine editor Forrest J. Ackerman and three films: "Psycho," "The
Exorcist" and "Night of the Living Dead.";   This year producer-director
Corman, actor Lugosi, the E.C. horror comics line and the films "Texas
Chainsaw Massacre" and "Jaws" will join the elite group. The group also will
name the best horror film of the year and announce it on the show.;   The
show's original host, Robert "Freddy Kreuger" Englund, once again will be
master of ceremonies, introducing such guests as Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh
from "Psycho," Zelda Rubenstein from the "Poltergeist" films, comics Sam
Kinison, Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers and actors Tim Matheson and Catherine
Hicks.;   Honoree Corman is best known as the sultan of schlock horror films,
whose work stretches from "Monster From the Ocean Floor" to the recent
"Frankenstein Unbound" and includes the popular series of Edgar Allan Poe
films starring Vincent Price. Less known is Corman's role as a distributor of
classy foreign films like Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata.";   Actor Lugosi,
who died in 1956, is the screen's most memorable Count Dracula, a role he
created on the Broadway stage and repeated in the 1931 "Dracula" film. Though
Lugosi spent most of his career in low-budget potboilers like "Voodoo Man" and
"Plan 9 From Outer Space," he created some classic screen characters like Ygor
in "The Son of Frankenstein" and Dr. Mirakle in "Murders in the Rue Morgue."
He also appeared in some mainstream classics like W.C. Fields' "International
House" and Garbo's "Ninotchka.";   "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," director Tobe
Hooper's gory film about demented country folk who mutilate unwary travelers,
is credited with starting a new wave of Grand Guignol films. "Jaws" is the
major box office hit about a great white shark terrorizing a seaside resort.
It made director Steven Spielberg a big name and became one of the movies'
all-time money-makers.;   E.C. Comics, published by William Gaines, featured a
whimsical, but graphically gory style in such titles as "The Haunt of Fear,"
"The Vault of Horror" and "Tales From the Crypt," which survives as a TV
series on HBO. The comics line is generally blamed for provoking the
controversy that led to adoption of the comics industry's Comic Books Code.
