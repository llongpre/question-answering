   Nike Inc. has Bo Jackson and spends more than $35 million a year on advertising. 

   Ryka Inc., Weymouth, Mass., has body trainer Jake Steinfeld and an ad budget of less than $2 million. 
Undaunted, it intends to take on Nike and scores of other established companies in the $4 billion-a-year athletic shoe market. 

   Ryka, a 25-employee firm led by a husband and wife team, hopes to become the next hot shoe company by using cheap but ingenious "guerrilla" marketing in selling shoes specifically designed for athletic women. 
Its tactics, other than Mr. Steinfeld, include targeting marketing efforts in California. 

   "We'd love to be the next Reebok," said John Gillis, a Ryka vice president, although the fledgling company initially would settle for steady growth. 

   Treading in the land of consumer product giants is risky business for small companies. 
Reebok International Ltd. may have scored big in the early 1980s when it entered the aerobic shoe market, as well as L.A. Gear Inc. when it followed in the mid-1980s by peddling stylish sneakers. 
But their very success makes it all the harder for Ryka to succeed. 
Six years ago, for example, athletic-shoe companies spent a total of $20 million on advertising; last year, they spent more than $100 million. 

   But Ryka is undeterred. 
"Retailers definitely recognize the need for this category of shoe," said Sheri Poe, Ryka's president. 
For many years, major shoemakers designed women's shoes by simply shrinking a man's last (a block of plastic shaped like a foot on which shoes are made) to fit a woman, Ms. Poe said. 
"But women have different hips and pelvises and their feet strike the ground differently. 
We developed a special last that takes that into consideration," she said. 
Industry analysts said they believe Ryka is the only athletic shoemaker that designs strictly for women. 
It was among the first to use the special last for women in athletic shoes; now competitors like Nike are following suit. 

   Many retailers agree that a category of specially designed women's shoes could be popular. 
"I think they have the right concept," said a spokeswoman for Lady Foot Locker, a subsidiary of F.W. Woolworth Co. 
"They advertise nationally in different magazines, and a lot of women tear out the ad and bring it into our stores looking for the shoe," she said. 

   Making lasts just for women is an advance in women's footwear that is here to stay, podiatric sports experts say. 
"Women's feet are different from men's feet," said Lloyd Smith, a podiatrist based in Newton, Mass. 
Specialized lasts fulfill women's needs for a shoe made in their shape and size, he said. 

   Unfortunately for Ryka, other companies have also recognized this untapped women's market. 
Nike, for example, plans to introduce nine new specialized technical shoes for women in the coming season, including aerobic, walking, tennis and even cycling shoes. 
They would be in addition to its first running, basketball and volleyball shoes made on a woman's last, which Nike began producing last year. 
Those three styles alone raised Nike's sales in women's footwear 45% last year. 

   The cost of Ryka's shoes range from about $50 to $80 a pair, comparable to the women's sneakers of its competitors. 

   Some investors like the idea of specialized women's shoes, too. 
Ryka, which sold 3.5 million shares at $1 each in an initial public offering in 1988, was quoted Friday at $1.813 bid in over-the-counter trading. 

   Ryka's problem, like all small companies entering a crowded market, is getting attention. 
But its budget won't let Ryka go toe-to-toe with the big guys. 
That's where Jake Steinfeld comes in. 

   Mr. Steinfeld, a Hollywood body trainer who was given an undisclosed amount of Ryka stock and a small stipend, has all his assistants wearing Ryka shoes on his syndicated TV fitness show, "Body by Jake." 
The show has a 70% female audience. 

   "I'm here in the Hollywood community trying to put all the gals in the shoes," Mr. Steinfeld said. 
"It's more of a boutique type of shoe right now." 
But Mr. Steinfeld says more people in workout studios are wearing Ryka shoes as well as a number of his celebrity clients, such as actress Bette Midler. 

   Popular shoe trends start out in California because people there tend to be open to new things, Ms. Poe said. 
Ryka has focused intently on Southern California, advertising in three California magazines and on local radio stations. 
In addition, Ryka's top management frequently makes in-store promotional visits hoping to excite store clerks about the brand. 

   So far, this focused marketing strategy appears to be working. 
In the past four months alone, Ryka's sales in California rose to 36% from 24% of its total sales. 

   Ryka is also trying such other low-budget marketing ploys as exhibiting aerobics shoes at shoe conventions, offering discounts to aerobics instructors and serving as the official shoe of the Miss Teen USA pageant. 

   Advertising isn't Ryka's only problem. 
Like many small companies, it had quality control problems initially. 
Specifically, it had difficulty perfecting its patented technology -- a nitrogen molding resembling clear rubber bouncing balls that fit into the foundation of the shoe. 
Complaints about poor stitching and other quality problems caused one athletic shoe chain to send almost its entire fall shipment back to Ryka. 
But since then, Ryka's quality problems with the molding have been corrected, Mr. Gillis said. 

   Despite initial setbacks, Ryka's distributors are pleased with the concept behind Ryka. 
"We think their technology is excellent," said a spokesman for Jordan Marsh, a department store subsidiary of Campeau Corp. of Toronto. 
"Their styling is definitely contoured for a woman's foot." 

   Ryka's sales were $1.7 million in the first quarter of 1989 and company officials expect sales of as much as $7 million for the year, compared with $1.4 million in 1988. 
With 900 accounts and shoes at only 1,500 stores vs. a potential 10,000 stores, retailers like Nordstrom Inc. say it's too early to tell how successful Ryka will be. 
In 1988, Ryka had a net loss of $1.5 million. 

   "Everyone always said Nike ignored the women's market . . . that we were such a macho company. 
And for a certain time, that was true, to an extent," said Elizabeth Dolan, a spokeswoman for the company. 
But this past year, Nike ran a lot of ads specifically for women. 
"We realized there is a huge market out there." 

   Adds Ms. Dolan: "This is not a marketing game. 
Small companies can do well if they can make a quality product. 
Ryka found a good niche . . . but we are taking customers from them."
