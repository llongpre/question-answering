<TEXT>
   Hans Hellmut Kirst, one of West
Germany's most successful post-war novelists, died Thursday at the
age of 74.
   Among his 46 books was the 1962 drama ``Night of the Generals,''
which was made into a motion picture in Hollywood.
   Kirst's works, which were translated into 28 languages and sold
more than 12 million copies worldwide, focused on military life and
modern historical events, such as the July 20, 1944, assassination
attempt of Adolf Hitler.
   Born Dec. 5, 1914, in the East Prussian city of Osterode, Kirst
left school in 1933 to become a career soldier with Hitler's army.
He served throughout World War II and was imprisoned by U.S.
occupation forces after the fall of Nazi Germany.
   He began his writing career in the late 1940s and gained
prominence with his ``08-15'' trilogy in the mid-1950s. ``08-15'' is
a military designation for basic recruits, stemming from the name of
a standard pistol issued to troops during World War I.
   His honors included a 1965 Edgar Allen Poe Award and the Knight
of Mark Twain designation in 1968.
