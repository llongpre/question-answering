  [Text] London, March 16--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today reaffirmed India's solemn commitment to 
fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the constitution and 
asserted that "there is no question of any going back on human 
rights of the individual citizens," reports PTI. 
  Speaking after paying his homage to the historic magna 
carta, 
a source of inspiration and a symbol of freedom under the law 
throughout the world, Mr Rao said the Indian constitution 
provides the individual freedoms in no uncertain terms and 
chapter three of the constitution on fundamental rights was full 
elaboration of the principles symbolised by the magna carta 
memorial. The memorial was erected at the spot at which King 
John and his barons put their seal to charter of magna carta 779 
years ago on June 15, 1215. 
  The Prime Minister unveiled a commemorative plaque and 
planted an English oak at the memorial on the bank of river 
Thames at Runnymede in Surrey about 25 km from here to mark 
significance of this symbol of freedom on India's development of 
democratic government. 
  Mr Rao briefly addressed the distinguished audience which 
had 
gathered at the memorial in the meadows of Surrey braving heavy 
showers and a mild hailstorm before the Prime Minister's 
arrival. The memorial was erected in 1957 by the American Bar 
Association whose central pillar bears the inscription "to 
commemorate magna carta, symbol of freedom under law." 
  The Indian Prime Minister is the second statesman after 
President, J.F. Kennedy to associate himself with the home of 
magna carta. 
  Mr Rao spoke about the human rights situation in India and 
said those in the administration knew how difficult it was for 
the government to conform to the stringent law of freedom in 
the Indian judicial system. "But we are doing and there is no 
question of going back on the fundamental freedom of the human 
rights of individual citizens." 
  Mr Rao ruled out India accepting any "regional" arrangement 
for nuclear non-proliferation and called for a global and 
non-discriminatory regime against proliferation. 
  "Proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity 
prevented without a global and non-discriminatory regime," Mr 
Rao told Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, during their 
30-minute meeting here on the third day of the Prime Minister's 
four-day official visit to the U.K. yesterday. 
  Aboard his aircraft, the Prime Minister said Britain's stand 
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "is not very far from 
ours." 
  On the British view on Kashmir, Mr Rao said that its 
position 
was not identical to India's "but on the whole it is not very 
far from our stand."
