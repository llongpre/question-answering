   Police today accused ``international socialists''
of being behind widespread tax protests that disrupted local
council meetings and led to clashes with authorities.
   But a protest organizer said 99 percent of the demonstrators
were local people angered at having to pay higher taxes.
   The controversial new ``community charge'' is a flat tax on all
adults over age 18 that opponents say unfairly favors the wealthy.
   People rebelling against it included an 89-year-old former war
correspondent who handed back his medal at Buckingham Palace and a
teacher who lectured magistrates on the Magna Carta.
   Four constables were injured and 21 demonstrators arrested
Tuesday in the worst violence, in Bristol. Anti-tax disturbances
also were reported in Bradford, Birmingham, Exeter, Maidenhead,
Norwich, Weston-super-Mare, Worcester, Gillingham, Lowestoft and
Reading.
   Police Federation chairman Alan Eastwood claimed that many
protesters were from outside London.
   ``It is rent-a-mob Trotskyites who attend most of these
demonstrations,'' he contended in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. Radio 4.
   ``Why should a police officer have to be assaulted because
somebody feels aggrieved about a tax? It is these international
socialists who take on any issue to have a go at the police,'' he
said.
   Steve Nally, secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax
Federation, said he sympathized with the far-left Militant group,
which along with ``many other people from a broad political
spectrum'' had been involved in peaceful protests against what has
been dubbed the poll tax.
   He insisted 99 percent of the protesters were local people.
   ``We don't condone the violence that has gone on, but we
understand people are very angry about this issue,'' he said on the
same program.
   The citizens were backed by their representatives in the House
of Commons, where Michael Martin of the opposition Labor Party told
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ``Your friends are deserting you.
Why don't you give up this irrational obsession to implement the
poll tax?''
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose waning popularity has been blamed in part
on the tax, again blamed local councils for spending too much money
and thus forcing taxes to be increased.
   Scuffles began in Bristol as about 500 demonstators learned that
the council set a tax of $810 per adult per year, one of the
highest in England. One policeman was taken to the hospital
unconscious after he was knocked to the ground, kicked and punched.
   In the northern city of Birmingham, protesters scuffled with
council officials and police. A councilor of the governing
Conservative party and two teenage aides held doors to the council
chamber shut and kept all but half a dozen demonstrators out.
   David Green, 18, who is working for the Conservatives before
starting university studies, was punched in the face and bruised.
``They just started to push their way in and I was determined to
stop them,'' he said.
   The council meeting was suspended for 30 minutes. There were no
arrests.
   Two officers were injured as police fought running battles with
tax protesters in Weston-Super-Mare in Avon. The council meeting
there was suspended for more than two hours as doors and windows
were smashed and scores of people invaded the building.
   One group of protesters staged a sit-in annd nine people were
arrested before order was restored, police said.
   Council meetings in Norwich and Maidenhead were halted by
invasions of demonstrators. Several people were injured when
trouble erupted outside the civic offices in Reading, Berkshire.
   Hand-clapping protesters disrupted a hearing in Bradford, where
teachers also walked out Tuesday to protest spending cuts made to
keep the tax down to 267 pounds ($440).
   A day earlier, protesters dressed as Robin Hood's merry band
invaded the council chamber in Nottingham, blew whistles, tossed
papers and attacked council members with shaving-cream pies.
   Former war correspondent Richard McMillan, 89, who returned his
Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace, said his protest
was not for himself ``but for the hundreds of thousands of poor
people who are worse off than I am.''
   Robert Orme lectured magistrates in Stroud, Gloucestershire that
the Magna Carta, signed by King John at Runnymede in 1215, requires
``general consent'' to any tax.
   ``This government appears to have general dissent,'' he said.
   The average English household will pay 170 pounds ($280) more
under the community charge than under the property tax it replaces
_ an increase from $837 to $1,112, the BBC said Tuesday.
   The figures were calculated by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance Accountants based on charges already set by 250 councils.
