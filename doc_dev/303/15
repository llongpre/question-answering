   Sen. Edward Kennedy laid a white rose
at the foot of a British memorial to his brother, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy, slain 25 years ago today.
   Kennedy today walked across a field and climbed a tree-lined
stone path to the roughly oblong, five-foot high slab of stone that
is Britain's tribute to the assassinated president.
   Wearing a black trenchcoat, he placed the flower at the foot of
the memorial, crossed himself and mouthed a silent prayer.
   Runnymede, 21 miles west of London, was chosen as the site for
the memorial because it was here in 1215 that King John sealed the
Magna Carta, the great charter regarded as the foundation of British
human rights.
   Kennedy came here with three English friends of the family, Dinah
Bridge, Lady Anne Tree and Chiquita Astor, as well as American
artist James Wyeth, painter of a celebrated portrait of President
Kennedy, and historical author Larry Collins.
   The Massachusetts Democrat is in Britain on a private trip and he
visited Runnymede with little advance publicity.
   Kennedy told a reporter the memorial had ``a special meaning to
all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to come out
with some of the close friends ... dear friends of President
Kennedy.''
   ``My sister Kathleen's and my brother Joe's lives were lost not
far from here,'' he said. Kathleen was killed in a plane crash over
northern France in 1948 and Joseph went down with his World War II
bomber over eastern England in 1944.
   Kennedy declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th
anniversary of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's
extremely important to celebrate the life of President Kennedy
rather than the tragedy. We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and
the hope of his life rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   The anniversary attracted a trickle of British Kennedy admirers
to the memorial. Among the first was Daphne James, 44, a publishing
company secretary who said she needed to be somewhere ``where you
feel you're close to him for a little while.''
   Mrs. James was at home on Nov. 22, 1963, when news of the
assassination in Dallas reached Britain.
   ``I think I spent about 2{ hours crying solidly though I was
trying to get a family to bed,'' she said.
   ``He was special and I want for us not to forget he was a special
person.''
   The memorial, paid for by public donations, was unveiled in 1965
and carries an inscription from Kennedy's own words: ``We shall pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or
oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of
liberty.''
   It stands on the side of the hill, not on top, to symbolize a
life cut short before its time.
