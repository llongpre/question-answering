   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Sunday called for a new Magna Carta that would establish basic
rights for all Europeans, including the Soviets.
   Mrs. Thatcher also renewed her call for the United Nations to
apply a total economic embargo against Iraq unless it withdraws
without delay from its occupation of Kuwait. She said the embargo
only would be fully effective if it were supported by all members
of the United Nations.
   ``Iraq's invastion of Kuwait defies every principle for which
the UN stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel
safe again. The law of the jungle takes over,'' she said.
   The prime minister devoted most of her remarks to more than
3,000 people at the Aspen Institute to her vision of the new Europe.
   ``The European Community has reconciled antagonisms within
Western Europe; it should now help to overcome divisions between
East and West in Europe,'' she sand at the closing session of the
Institute's 40th anniversary.
   ``We don't see this new Soviet Union as an enemy, but as a
country groping its way towards freedom. We no longer have to view
the world through the prism of East-West relations. The Cold War is
over.''
   At the end of her half-hour speech inside the big blue-and-white
Aspen Music Festival tent, the crowd gave Thatcher a standing
ovation.
   About 1,700 people were seated inside the big top. The rest were
scattered about the lawn outside in the warm, summer air.
   Thatcher traveled to the institute to address its annual
symposium and receive its Statesman Award, which recognized the
prime minister's long reign and her commitment to democracy and
peace.
   Thatcher met with President Bush in Aspen on Thursday before his
opening address at the institute. She is scheduled to travel to
Washington, D.C., Monday for an afternoon meeting with Bush, then
return to London early Tuesday.
   During her speech, Thatcher said Western nations need to help
nations struggling to establish democracy, but at the same time
maintain a secure defense, including NATO and U.S. forces in Europe.
   ``The unity and strength which we in the West have found from
joining together in defense can now be turned to serve more
positive and ambitious purposes,'' she said.
   King John of England was forced by English barons to grant the
original Magna Carta at Runnymede, England, June 15, 1215. It
traditionally has been interpreted as guaranteeing certain civil
and political liberties.
   The prime minister said her proposed European Magna Carta would
``entrench for every European citizen, including those of the
Soviet Union, the basic rights we in the West take for granted.''
   Among those rights: freedom of speech, worship, access to law
and the marketplace, and the freedom to hold democratic elections,
own property, maintain nationhood and remain free of ``fear of an
over-mighty state.''
   She also suggested that the European Community be poised to
accept all Eastern European nations as members ``when democracy has
taken root and their economies are capable of sustaining
membership.''
   ``We can't say in one breath that they are part of Europe, and
in the next our European Community Club is so exclusive that we
won't admit them,'' she said.
   Founded in 1950, the non-profit Aspen Institute gathers leaders
in all parts of society to discuss critical issues of the world.
The symposium this weekend concentrated on topics including health
care and education.
