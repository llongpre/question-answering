   ST. LOUIS -- Magna Group Inc. and Landmark Bancshares
Corp. amended their October merger agreement, to fix the
value that Landmark common shareholders will receive at $9.80
a share.
   Under terms of the original agreement between the two bank
holding companies, Landmark shareholders were to receive for
each of their shares 50 cents cash and 0.898 shares of Magna
common stock, regardless of the market value of Magna's
common stock.

   The amended pact calls for the exchange ratio of stock to
fluctuate between 0.62 and 1.033 shares of Magna, if the
average market value of Magna's common stock is between $9
and $15 during a specified 20-day period.
   Magna would thus issue between 4.5 million and 7.5 million
common shares of its stock to Landmark shareholders and the
combined company would have between 18 million and 21 million
shares outstanding upon completion of the merger, Magna said.
   "Under the variable pricing structure of the original
agreement, the recent trading prices of Magna's common stock
would have resulted in an unacceptable level of intangible
assets for the combined company," Magna said. Even with a
fixed price, Magna said, "the transaction is now expected to
generate intangible assets for the combined company because
of current estimates for purchase accounting adjustments
required at closing and the approximately $19 million net
change in Landmark's tangible book value since the October
1990 merger agreement."
   By establishing a fixed value for the transaction, "we are
controlling the probable level of intangibles produced in the
transactions," Magna said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magna
shares climbed $1 to close at $13; Landmark shares slipped
12.5 cents to close at $8.75.
