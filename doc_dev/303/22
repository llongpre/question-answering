   Magna International Inc., Canada's largest auto-parts manufacturer, said it is negotiating with auto makers about assembling complete motor vehicles for them. 

   Jerry Barker, a company spokesman, declined to identify the auto makers, but an industry source said they are based in Detroit. 
He didn't elaborate. 

   Magna is looking at producing about 10,000 units annually, the source said. 
Should the project proceed, Mr. Barker said it would be run by Cosma International Inc., a Magna subsidiary formed yesterday. 

   Magna said Cosma comprises Magna's 27 U.S. and Canadian stamping plants and its tooling joint ventures with Japan's Fuji Tool &amp; Die Co. and Mueller-Weingarten of West Germany. 
Together, these operations will generate sales of about $400 million (Canadian) in fiscal 1987, ending July 31, Magna said. 

   Cosma is based in Bramalea, Ontario, near the new unit's main stamping plant. 
Mr. Barker said Magna is considering an initial public offering by the new unit. 

   Magna, which reported sales of $1.03 billion (Canadian) for fiscal 1986, said its chairman, Frank Stronach, also will serve as Cosma's chairman. 
Ueli Spring, formerly a vice president of Magna's stamping operations, was named president of the unit.
