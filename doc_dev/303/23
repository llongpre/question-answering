   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc. said it reached an
agreement in principle with its lenders to restructure 560
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$485.9 million) of its more
than C$1 billion in debt.
   The auto parts maker said it will continue to cut costs,
sell assets and seek joint venture partners to meet its debt
obligations.

   Under the restructuring plan, Magna will make payments of
C$279 million and C$153 million on May 31 and Dec. 31
respectively. Of the May 31 payment, C$120 million will be
financed through sales of real estate assets to principal
units of the company. Part of the payments will go to holders
of C$75 million of Magna Series 1 Debentures. The holders
agreed to extend the maturity date of the debentures to May
31 from the original date of Dec. 31.
   The remaining C$128 million of debt will be restructured
through loans to Magna subsidiaries.
   A "substantial" portion of the amount due to be repaid on
May 31, is already available, the company said. It said it
"has identified further transactions which are expected to
produce the balance of the funds required for the May 31
distribution."
   Magna asked its creditors for help in restructuring its
debt almost a year ago. The company's financial troubles stem
from overexpansion at a time when the auto industry was
heading into a slump and interest rates in Canada were high.
   As part of the consideration for the lenders'
participation in the plan, the company agreed to issue to
them warrants to purchase 2,750,000 Class A Subordinate
Voting Shares of the company, or about 10% of the class, at
C$4 a share.
   The company didn't elaborate on the financing for the Dec.
31 payment.
   In other news, Magna said the trustees of the Stronach
Trust acquired from Magna Chairman Frank Stronach, and a
company controlled by him, 697,929 Class B Magna shares, or
about a 51% voting interest in the company.
   Prior to this acquisition the trust held no Magna shares.
The family trust was established for estate planning purposes
for the benefit of Mr. Stronach and his family, the company
said.
