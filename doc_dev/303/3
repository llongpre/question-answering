<LEADPARA>  The barons of England met with King John "in the meadow called Ronimed between
Windsor and Staines" on this date in 1215 to squeeze out of him that little
article known as the Magna Carta. A basic document in the developing history

freedom to individually clank around in armor free as anything and to bash
peasants liberally whether or not the king approved.  </LEADPARA>
