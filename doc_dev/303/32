   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc., a financially
troubled auto parts manufacturer, said it is holding
"serious" discussions with two parties interested in
acquiring stakes of as much as 50% in three of the company's
operating divisions.
   Frank Stronach, Magna's chairman and controlling
shareholder, wouldn't disclose the identity of the parties,
but said he expects a formal announcement for a strategic
partnership would be made within two to three months.

   "We are in the talking stage with a number of people" with
the intention of forming joint ventures for "a big chunk of
our business," Mr. Stronach said in an interview. Magna,
based here, is looking for partners to take stakes of between
30% and 50% in each of the divisions, he said.
   Magna has four main operating divisions, or systems
groups. These include Cosma, a manufacturer of automotive
body systems; Decoma, a maker of exterior parts; Tesma, which
builds parts for auto powertrains; and Atoma, which builds
interior parts. Atoma already is 25% owned by Japan's
Mitsubishi Corp.
   Mr. Stronach said Magna has little choice but to find
equity partners if it is to reduce its debt. "If for one
reason or another we couldn't find a joint venture partner,
we would sell a {whole} systems group," he said.
   Magna has been in technical default on most of its debt
since last year as cash flow dried up in the wake of a sharp
slowdown in the North American auto industry. The company
found itself saddled with excess capacity, and bloated debt,
following an ambitious expansion program in the late 1980s.
   By selling various assets, Magna already has lowered its
debt that is subject to restructuring negotiations with its
lenders to 959 million Canadian dollars (US$829.6 million) at
Jan. 31 from C$1.03 billion at the end of its fiscal year
last July 31.
