   Magna International Inc. said it agreed to build an auto parts plant in a joint venture with the Soviet automotive company AutoZaz. 

   Magna, a Toronto-based auto parts manufacturer, said the plant will be based in the Ukraine in the city of Zaporozh and will produce molds for parts such as auto dashboards and bumpers. 
Magna said it will invest 25 million Canadian dollars (US$20.7 million) in the facility and train its Soviet managers and technical personnel at its Toronto operations. 
Production is to start early next year.
