  [Editorial Report] Called by Carlos Magno the "national 
figure of the year" in the 24 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
newly reelected Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, a Socialist Party 
(PS) luminary, is now generally seen as the North's "new star." 
According to Magno, Porto, which needed a leader in 1989 when 
Gomes was first elected, identified with the "technocratic 
discourse" of this economist and Eurodeputy possessing a "very 
short political resume." Following his election, Gomes was 
increasingly recognized as a "serious player." It was remembered 
that the late legendary PSD leader Sa Carneiro had asked him to 
join his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on the strength of his 
conviction that "this man will go far." In fact, Lisbon 
politicians no longer laugh when Gomes is mentioned as a 
possible Socialist Party (PS)leader or even presidential 
candidate, Magno comments. The Porto mayor is his own man, he 
continues, quoting him as saying that "I did not leave the 
European Parliament when the Portuguese Government wished to 
push me out, and I do not go where others want to take me." 
According to Magno, Gomes is "calmly" preparing his way south to 
the capital, but remains fully aware that his "vital space" is 
still Porto, at a distance from the seat of government that 
enhances his authority. PS leader Antonio Guterres, who called 
him a "statesman" during the municipal election campaign, had 
nicknamed him "Mr. North" when Gomes helped him wrest the PS 
leadership from former secretary general Jorge Sampaio. In fact, 
despite rumors that Gomes and Guterres will fight for the party 
leadership, nothing points to a duel between the two men, Magno 
asserts, noting that while they may fear each other, their 
relationship also involves sincere mutual appreciation. Gomes' 
real test is still to come, Magno concludes: the sights of a 
winner of a string of regional victories in Porto are now 
naturally set on more important political battles at the end of 
the decade.
