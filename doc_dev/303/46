   Magna International Inc. said it will invest $40 million (Canadian) in a new plant in Pickering, Ontario, to make plastic auto body parts. 

   Magna, Canada's largest auto parts maker, said the plant will open early in 1988 and will employ about 450 persons. 
About 70% of the plant's production of plastic bumpers, fenders and grilles will be shipped to the U.S., Magna said.
