   LOS ANGELES -- Herbert Stone, a New York stockbroker, was
sentenced to 30 months in prison for his involvement in the
manipulation of the over-the-counter stock of Magna
Technologies Inc., a now-defunct Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
corporation.
   Mr. Stone, 63 years old, pleaded guilty in August 1990 to
12 counts of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud. Part
of the sentence, imposed by federal Judge Terry J. Hatter
Jr., is to run concurrently with the last several months of a
two-year sentence Mr. Stone is serving for stock manipulation
involving another over-the-counter stock, European Auto
Classics Inc., a now-defunct Great Neck, N.Y., company.

   Magna Technologies was a shell corporation with few
assets, no business income and substantial debts, according
to an indictment filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney John F.
Walsh. The indictment alleged that Mr. Stone and others
gained $1 million in illicit profits by manipulating the
stock from 50 cents in March 1985 to a September 1985 peak of
$9.50 a share.
   Mr. Stone acted as the primary market maker for Magna
stock, buying and selling the stock on the account of Norbay
Securities, a now-defunct New York firm where he worked,
according to the indictment.
   An attorney for Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Stone is the first individual in the Magna indictment
to be sentenced. Another defendant, Jacob Rubenstein, 46,
formerly of Woodland Hills, Calif., is now a fugitive,
according to Mr. Walsh.
   Robert Victor, 53, of Las Vegas, Nev., pleaded guilty to
four counts of securities and tax fraud in March in relation
to the Magna manipulation. And Robert Gutstein, 53, of
Thousand Oaks, was convicted of five counts of conspiracy and
securities and wire fraud last month. Both men are scheduled
to be sentenced this summer by Judge Hatter, Mr. Walsh said.
   Messrs. Rubenstein, Gutstein and Victor couldn't be
reached for comment.
