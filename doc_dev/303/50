   MAGNA INTERNATIONAL Inc. (Toronto) -- Stephen Akerfeldt
resigned as vice chairman and chief financial and
administrative officer of this financially troubled auto
parts manufacturer. Magna said Mr. Akerfeldt left to "pursue
other opportunities" but will continue to advise the company
as a consultant. Magna said Mr. Akerfeldt's departure won't
affect the company's negotiations to restructure nearly 1
billion Canadian dollars (US$864 million) in debt. It said it
expects to appoint a new chief financial officer soon.
