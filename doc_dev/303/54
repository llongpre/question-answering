   PARIS -- French stockbroker Fauchier Magnan Durant des
Aulnois said two of France's largest state-controlled
financial institutions have agreed to acquire a joint
majority in its capital.
   Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which manages France's
national savings bank network, will raise its stake to 35%
from 10%. Insurance group Union des Assurances de Paris will
go to 15.1% from 10%.

   Family-run Fauchier Magnan, whose current management will
remain in place, said it posted a profit in 1990, but gave no
precise figures. Financial details on the transaction were
unavailable, although company officials said no new shares
were being issued. Family members and employees currently own
about 70% of the firm.
   A spokeswoman for British broker Kleinwort Benson PLC,
which owns 10% of Fauchier Magnan, confirmed that her firm
intends to sell its shares, but gave no details. Kleinwort
recently set up its own securities office in Paris, although
it doesn't yet have its own seat on the stock market.
   Only a handful of independent stockbrokers, firms which
didn't sell control to larger financial institutions after
the Paris stock market reforms in 1988, remains in France.
Most of these were hurt to some extent by investors' lack of
confidence after the 1990 bankruptcy of Tuffier, Ravier, Py &amp;
Associes, the largest of the independents.
