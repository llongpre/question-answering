   LOS ANGELES -- Robert Victor of Las Vegas, Nev., was
sentenced to 30 months in prison for his involvement in the
manipulation of the over-the-counter stock of Magna
Technologies Inc., a now-defunct Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
corporation.
   Mr. Victor, 53 years old, pleaded guilty to three counts
of securities fraud and one count of tax fraud in March in
regard to the Magna manipulation. Mr. Victor was also
sentenced to pay a $20,000 fine by federal Judge Terry J.
Hatter Jr. In addition, he was ordered by Judge Hatter to pay
any outstanding income tax deficiencies.

   Magna Technologies was a shell corporation with few
assets, no business income and substantial debts, according
to an indictment filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney John F.
Walsh. The indictment alleged that Mr. Victor and others
gained illicit profits by manipulating the stock from 50
cents in March 1985 to a September 1985 peak of $9.50 a
share.
   According to the indictment, Mr. Victor orchestrated "sham
transactions" by six different persons to help boost the
price of the stock. He is the second person to be sentenced
in the case. Herbert Stone, a former New York stockbroker,
was sentenced in June, also to 30 months in prison, in the
Magna case.
   Mr. Victor couldn't be reached for comment.
