<LEADPARA>  BEFORE WE ever saw the electronic gray blob over the woman's face in the
William Kennedy Smith rape trial, the lawyer sitting at my left at dinner
warned me that the trial symbolized an erosion of my liberties.;   Did I
realize there were only six jurors, not 12? Wasn't I outraged? (Florida uses
12 jurors only in capital cases.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      No, I replied. I figured opposing lawyers would seek the same demographics
in a jury whether it was composed of six or 12 people. The overall percentages
-- liberal or conservative, Kennedy admirers or haters -- would remain the
same.;   The lawyer pounced. How many jurors would I be satisfied with, then?;
  "Three? Two? One? NONE?";   "You mean," I cried out, "having six jurors
instead of 12 is the slippery slope, the thin edge of the wedge?" My right to
jury trial was at risk? He nodded solemnly.;   This exposure of my crumbling
liberties -- many of them rooted in English common law -- came as I was
spooning horseradish sauce onto my roast beef.;   I don't usually talk jury
selection at dinner, but this was a unique occasion and group -- the fall
dinner meeting of the Rumpole Society in San Francisco. And discussion of
common law is not uncommon at Rumpole functions.;   Members are devoted to the
cult of Horace Rumpole, the rumpled, crafty, poetry-quoting British barrister
played to perfection by Leo McKern on the PBS "Mystery!" series. Created by
English author and barrister John Mortimer, Rumpole has been featured in some
40 short stories and TV shows. Like Alfred Hitchcock, the plumpish Mortimer
often makes cameo appearances in the series.;   Founded by a handful of
devotees in 1984, the San Mateo-based Rumpole Society has grown to 500
members. Mortimer was a dinner speaker in 1990. The 250 people attending the
November dinner meeting had only one thing in common -- a TV show.;  
Rumpolians are as well acquainted with 25B Froxbury Court, Gloucester Road,
London, as Sherlock Holmes devotees are with 221B  Baker Street, London. From
his flat, Rumpole takes the Underground to his law chambers in Equity Court.
He stops occasionally to dine at the Taste-Ee-Bite Cafe, defends his
often-seedy clients at the Old Bailey, then repairs to Pommeroy's Wine Bar for
a glass of Chateau Thames Embankment before heading home to face his frumpy
wife, Hilda, also known as "She Who Must Be Obeyed.";   "We felt Horace
Rumpole deserved a place in TV history, just as Sherlock Holmes did in
literary history," society President Bill Sears said.;   This is a group where
Runnymede (where the Magna Carta was signed) is mentioned more often than West
Palm Beach. Programs attract Rumpolians from the Bay Area and beyond.
Admittedly, the lawyer at my left (who'd flown in from Pennsylvania for the
event) went a little further in his Anglophilia than most: He'd had his own
barrister's wig crafted in London.;   Proceedings are simple. Drinks begin at
6:16 (a time typo that has become a tradition) at the society's version of
Pommeroy's Wine Bar. Such Rumpoliana is sold as "She Who Must Be Obeyed"
nightshirts, "Pommeroy's Plonk" wine labels and Rumpole hats and T-shirts.;  
A Rumpole character look-alike contest was won by Hertha Harrington of
Woodside, wife of San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Walter Harrington. As
Hilda, she wore a flowered bathrobe, her hair curlers covered with a blue
satin nightcap.;   Contributions were sought for the Rumpole cookbook. The
recipe for "Dodo's Favorite Cheesey Bits" is already in hand, but others
needed include "Death Sentence Muffins" and "Erskine-Brown's Muesli with
Fat-Free Yoghurt.";   Guest speaker Jacqueline Davis, producer of the Rumpole
series, flew over from London with news that shooting will begin on six new
episodes in March. "There's not much sex in 'Rumpole,' " she said. "We can't
afford the props." But she dropped a hint that Rumpole "might have a bit of a
fling" in the future.;   Meanwhile, the society is organizing a trip to
"Rumpole's England" in March with plans to drop in on the set. The holiday
will include a tour of legal London, including the Inns of Court and the Old
Bailey, and a visit to El Vino in Fleet Street, the inspiration for
Pommeroy's. For information on The Rumpole Society, write P.O. Box 906, San
Mateo 94403.  </TEXT>
