   Magna International Inc., Toronto, said its Cosma International Inc. and Decoma International Inc. units plan to offer a minority of their shares to the public in the U.S. and Canada. 

   Magna, a Markham, Ontario, auto parts manufacturer, said each unit will issue as much as 25% of its equity. 
It said proceeds of about 52 million Canadian dollars (US$44.2 million) for Cosma and C$62 million for Decoma will be used mainly to reduce bank debt. 

   First Boston Corp. is lead manager for the offerings in the U.S. and Scotia-McLeod Inc. and First Boston Canada Ltd. are co-managers in Canada. 

   Magna said Cosma makes stamped metal automotive parts, assemblies and systems and had sales of C$504 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988. 
It said Decoma makes decorative automotive metal and plastic trim and had fiscal 1988 sales of C$423 million.
