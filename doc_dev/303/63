<TEXT>
Canada's Magna International is expanding its European automotive parts
interests with an agreement to buy a 74 per cent stake in Zipperle, a
German-based maker of mirrors, from Porsche Austria.
The Zipperle acquisition is part of a strategy by Magna to forge closer
links with European carmakers, partly with an eye to supplying new North
American assembly plants being built by BMW and Mercedes Benz.
Magna, which declined to provide details of the deal, said it would work
with Porsche to expand Zipperle's business. Zipperle has annual sales of
about CDollars 150m (USDollars 115.4m).
The Canadian company already has interests in several European parts
factories. It recently bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt of
Germany, as well as a controlling stake in a Kolbenschmidt unit which makes
airbags and steering wheels.
The company is also keen to expand exchanges of know-how between its North
American and European operations. Several of its senior managers have
European roots.
Air Canada and rival Canadian Airlines have called in Mr Stanley Hartt, a
lawyer, to mediate in their dispute over ownership of the Gemini computer
reservations system.
Air Canada has been blocking Canadian Air's departure from the system
through the courts.
