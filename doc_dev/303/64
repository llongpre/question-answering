   Magna Group Inc. said an increase in its provision for
loan losses will result in a loss for the fourth quarter in
the range of 42 cents a share to 47 cents a share, compared
with net income of 35 cents in the fourth quarter of 1990.
   The St. Louis bank holding company also said it expects to
report 1991 fully diluted per-share earnings in the 25-cent
to 30-cent range compared with $1.31 in 1990.

   Magna said the decrease in earnings to $3.8 million from
$18.1 million is due to a provision for loan losses of $29.5
million, offsetting continued strong operating performance.
The provision was increased by $15.7 million in the fourth
quarter.
   The company said the acquisition of Landmark Bancshares
Corp., completed on December 20. However, Landmark's results
subsequent to the acquisition date aren't material and won't
be included in Magna's 1991 income statement.
