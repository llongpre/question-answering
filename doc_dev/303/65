   Three Soviet technicians will take a look
at the town of Magna to get a general feeling for the community
where their countrymen could be stationed if the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty is ratified.
   Dave Porter, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
State Department officials had confirmed the Soviet team was
expected in Utah today for a two-day review. An American contingent
was to conduct a similar tour in the Soviet Union.
   Porter said the Soviet technicians planned to tour Magna, about
25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, this afternoon. He said
specific details were not available.
   Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the Hercules
Bacchus West plant. Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a
compound near the plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty,
signed Dec. 7 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The treaty would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weaponry
in both countries' arsenals.
   The countries' inspection teams could be in place within 60 days
of the treaty's ratifications, officials say.
   The Soviets would monitor Hercules, which developed motors for
the Pershing II missiles, banned under the treaty, from 1979 to
1987.
   The Soviet technicians will be accompanied by four members of
the State Department's On-Site Inspection Agency, Porter said.
   Today, the Soviets will make a ``very general visit to (Magna).
It will just be the town, the stores, just to get a feeling for the
area,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the three technicians will conduct a similar tour
of Salt Lake City and then leave Friday, Porter said. He said no
news conferences or statements were planned.
   The Soviet and American advance teams will meet in Moscow a week
after the tours to discuss housing, travel and other arrangements,
Hatch's office said.
   Pershing II missile motors no longer are built at Hercules, but
the company has a contract for third-stage motors for the
intercontinental MX missile.
