   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has
indicted four men on numerous fraud charges in an alleged penny
stock manipulation scheme involving the securities of Magna
Technologies Inc., officials said Wednesday.
   The 42-count indictment, handed up March 7 and unsealed
Wednesday, charged Jacob Rubenstein, Dr. Robert Gutstein, Robert
Victor and Herbert Stone with numerous counts of securities, wire
and bank fraud as well as a single conspiracy count.
   In addition, Rubenstein, a promoter of Magna stock, was charged
with failure to file a tax return and Victor, a Los Angeles-area
businessman, faces a single tax fraud count.
   The indictment, announced jointly by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington and Robert L. Brosio, U.S. attorney for
the Central District of California, accused the four of a scheme
plotting to manipulate the stock price of Magna, ``which was, in
essence, a shell corporation'' located in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Gutstein was described in court papers as Magna's chairman and a
large shareholder. Stone was a securities trader with Norbay
Securities Inc. in New York, the primary market maker in Magna
stock.
   Low-cost, high-risk penny stocks, which trade for less than $5 a
share, are usually not listed on stock exchanges or the National
Association of Securities Dealers' automated stock price-quote
system. Investors often must rely on the few traders who handle the
company's stock to quote the latest buy or sell price _ making the
stocks prone to fraud and manipulation.
   The indictment stems from an earlier civil action brought by the
SEC against Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four others, most of
whom settled with the SEC.
   SEC documents in Washington provided no other details.
   In another matter, the SEC announced Wednesday that a federal
judge in Chicago ordered William A. Rooney Sr. to pay $28 million
in alleged illegal profits from a pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme.
   In a Ponzi scheme, named for a notorious scam artist in the
early part of this century, new investors are constantly recruited
so that their money can be used to pay off earlier clients, in a
pyramiding scheme that usually collapses as the money owed
investors grows beyond the company's abilities to recruit new funds.
   Rooney was accused in an SEC complaint Jan. 2 of diverting the
profits over a 17-year period from the sale of nine-month
promissory notes for three companies he controlled.
   Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge John A. Nordberg granted an
SEC request for default judgement against Rooney, including
disgorgement of $12 million in alleged illegal profits and $16
million in interest.
   SEC documents in Washington provided no other details.
