   Decades of neglect by judicial activists have turned parts of the Constitution into fossils. 
Now original-intent lawyers have rediscovered an ossified clause with a potentially enormous impact on tort law. 
For the first time, a defendant has challenged punitive damages on the ground that they violate the Eighth Amendment rule that "excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed." 

   Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. refused to pay a policyholder because it concluded that his surgical amputation was required by a degenerative disease, not by an insured accidental injury. 
A Mississippi jury said the accident was to blame, and ordered the firm to pay the $20,000 under the policy plus $1.6 million in punitive damages. 
The company objects that the punitive award violates the excessive fines clause. 
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last week. 

   Under Anglo-American common law, courts traditionally denied punitive damages except in certain narrow cases of gross fraud. 
But the zeal of some contingency-fee lawyers has transformed punitive damages into the major fuel of the litigation explosion. 
A RAND study found that by 1980-84 the average "bad-faith" award in Los Angeles was more than $3 million, and that more than a third of defendants found to have breached contracts had to pay punitive damages. 

   Deep-pocket insurance companies are the preferred targets. 
As in this case, lawyers demand that firms pay the disputed policy, plus punitive damages for daring to challenge the payment of a benefit. 
This litigation strategy is described in detail by William Shernoff, a California lawyer, in his 1986 book, "Payment Refused." 
In the book's foreword, Ralph Nader explained that the huge awards "punish the insurance companies for refusing to honor their policies." 

   Former Justice Department lawyers Ted Olson and Larry Simms developed the argument based on the Constitution's excessive fines clause. 
They cited the Magna Carta as the source of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against court fines as a form of punishment. 
King John agreed to limit amercements, or fines. 
"A freeman shall not be amerced for a slight offence, except in accordance with the degree of the offence; and for a grave offence he shall be amerced in accordance with the gravity of the offence, yet saving always his contenement," the clause says. 
The language is archaic, but the Eighth Amendment and modern jurisprudence endorse its principle of proportionality. 

   The brief says punitive damages are "vague, elusive and retroactively applied." 
There is no relationship between compensatory and punitive damages or between the defendant's alleged wrongdoing and the fine. 
The damages are a due-process violation because they "reward plaintiffs indiscriminately and impose crushing financial burdens for the most whimsical of reasons." 
The brief also made the separation of powers argument that even if the insurer had committed a fraud, private punishment via the courts is inappropriate because the state legislature has established criminal penalties. 
The top fine is $1,000, well below $1.6 million. 

   The abuses by Naderite tort lawyers have so far confounded the legal system's ability to correct itself. 
This case is a sign that the Constitution itself is a tool against gross abuses, and a source of wisdom on the nature of justice that we literally cannot afford to ignore.
