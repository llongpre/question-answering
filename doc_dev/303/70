   Chieko Nishimura Aoki, named just last month as
chief executive officer and deputy chairman of Westin Hotels &amp;
Resorts, resigned Friday, citing health reasons.
   Mrs. Aoki had shared leadership of the 65-hotel chain with her
husband, John H. Aoki, the president and chief executive officer of
Aoki Corp., which bought the Seattle-based Westin last year.
   Larry B. Magnan, president of Westin, will succeed Mrs. Aoki,
40, as chief executive, the company said.
   Friday's announcement follows a series of top-level changes at
Westin this year.
   Magnan, 44, was appointed president in January, when he
succeeded Helmut Hoermann, who had joined Westin four months
earlier. At the time, Westin said it was undergoing an examination
of its corporate structure.
   Magnan previously was Westin's senior vice president for
technical services and had managed hotels in Asia and Colorado.
   In an interview two weeks ago, Mrs. Aoki declined to say much
about the executive changes. ``Compared to other types of
acquisitions of companies, our turnover was very, very low, because
normally they change the whole officers,'' she said.
   She noted that the promotions of Magnan and others were from
within the chain, ``so it's not putting the house down and creating
utterly new things.''
   Hiroyuki Tsuru, spokesman for Aoki Corp. in Seattle, said Mrs.
Aoki stepped down because of health problems aggravated by her new
role in the company.
   Tsuru declined to comment beyond that statement, and would not
elaborate on the health problems.
   Karen Amrhine, spokeswoman for Westin in New York, also declined
to give details of the health difficulties. Ms. Amrhine said she
did not know what Mrs. Aoki's future plans would be.
   Mrs. Aoki came to Westin after serving as president of Cesar
Park Hotels Group, another Aoki subsidiary. Ms. Amrhine said Mrs.
Aoki would not be further involved in the Caesar Park management.
   Aoki Corp., is a Japanese construction and transportation
company with sales of about $3 billion last year. Aoki bought
Westin in 1988 for $1.5 billion as previous owner Allegis Corp.
retrenched into United Airlines.
   While John Aoki took over as Westin chairman with the retirement
of longtime chief Harry Mullikin, Mrs. Aoki was in charge of the
chain's operation.
   Mrs. Aoki, a native of Fukuoka, Japan, is a naturalized
Brazilian. A corporate attorney specializing in labor law, with a
degree in business administration, she met Aoki while he was
working at the Japanese consulate in Brazil. They married 12 years
ago.
   Aoki Corp. bought Brazil's Caesar Park Hotels as an investment,
and Mrs. Aoki became its sales and marketing director in the early
1980s. She became executive vice president in 1983 and president in
1986, helping the chain grow to nine hotels, including New York's
Algonquin and Los Angeles' Beverly Wilshire.
