T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and engineering group, last night agreed
to acquire an option to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading
German motor components producer. The complex deal, which would give T&amp;N a
dominant position in the German market for some key engine components, must
be approved by the German cartel authorities.
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and engineering
group, is to sell its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt. Magna
International, the Canadian automotive components group, is to reduce its
stake in Kolbenschmidt from 12.5 to 2.5 per cent. As a first step,
Commerzbank is to take over a 24.99 per cent holding in Kolben-schmidt, and
German institutional investors will take over 32 per cent.
Metallgesellschaft said the deal meant its disposal programme was almost
complete.
T&amp;N has acquired an option on the Commerzbank-held shares and on a stake of
25.01 per cent to be held by the institutions. The option must be exercised
by March 31 1995. T&amp;N could take the remaining 2.5 per cent still held by
Magna, giving it an option to acquire a total stake of 52.5 per cent. The
deal could cost T&amp;N almost DM300m (Pounds 123.9m).
Last year T&amp;N bought German-based Goetze, Europe's largest producer of
piston rings. Kolbenschmidt had sales of DM1.59bn in 1992-93.
