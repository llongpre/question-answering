   A flood has severely damaged one of
the world's greatest ancient cities, and the Libyan government has
appealed for help in repairing the ruins of the once-glorious Roman
metropolis.
   A torrent of water rushed over Leptis Magna, about 75 miles east
of Tripoli, in November after several days of heavy rains sent
water over a dam three miles from the ancient trading center on the
Mediterranean coast.
   For three days, the rampaging river carried tons of dirt and
uprooted vegetation through the ruins, leaving mud yards deep in
such remarkable areas as the Roman Emperor Hadrian's baths and one
of two forums.
   Most heavily damaged was the Colonnaded Street, a 400-yard-long
road on which visitors strolled from the bath complex to the
ancient port. Much of the stone carriageway, lined with more than
200 marble columns with lotus designs, broke under the weight of
the floodwaters.
   The port end of the street disappeared and is now covered by a
small river. Near the heart of the ancient city, the waters reduced
the path to a jumble of stone blocks and columns fashioned from
Egyptian granite and Italian marble.
   Only the ancient market, theater and forum were spared the wrath
of the flood.
   Sandro Stucchi, an Italian archaeologist who surveyed the site,
estimated restoration would cost $33 million and take 10 years.
   Omar S. Almahgiub, superintendent of the archeological district
that includes Leptis Magna, said the Libyan government is hoping to
restore the site with help from the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
   ``We want to make an appeal to all people who love monuments,''
said Almahgiub, looking at the weeds sprouting from several inches
of sun-baked dirt covering the base of the basilica's pulpit.
   Almahgiub, who was born in Leptis and whose father was a
caretaker of the site, said Libya would provide the personnel to do
the manual work but doesn't have the technical expertise.
   Bekaddour Ouldali of UNESCO in Paris said the organization has
asked Italy _which colonized Libya until World War II _ to provide
funds for a archaeological supervisor, preferably Stucchi, and has
provided earth-removal equipment and a pump in case a flood strikes
again.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry official, Manfredo Incisa, says his
government is willing to help but is waiting for a more detailed
report from UNESCO.
   Little is known outside Libya about the disaster because Libya's
magnificent archaeological inheritance is not easily seen.
   Tourism per se doesn't exist in the state ruled by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi. A recent summer Tuesday brought only about a dozen
visitors to Leptis Magna, almost all of them foreign diplomatic,
construction or oil employees.
   In addition, lovers of archaeology must step delicately in
Libya, whose regime frequently rails against foreign imperialism.
For the more militant Gadhafi supporters, reminders of ancient
colonialism like Leptis Magna are unwanted souvenirs to be
destroyed.
   Italians began excavating the sprawling city about 1912, the
same year the Rome-based government of dictator Benito Mussolini
occupied Libya, which Italy controlled until the arrival of the
Allied forces in 1943.
   The flood halted dreams for extensive excavation of the harbor,
considered one of the best preserved in the ancient Roman world and
expected to yield many relics from Leptis' beginnings as a key
Phoenician port and later a prosperous Roman city.
   Leptis was founded by seafaring Phoenicians from Carthage as a
trading post in the first millennium B.C. As merchants developed a
brisk business in ivory, ebony, slaves, gold and precious stones
from Africa, the site was established as a colony of Carthage about
the 7th or 6th century B.C.
   In 101 B.C., Leptis became an ally of Rome and its residents
gained full rights of citizenship.
   The city prospered during the reign of Emperor Septimius
Severus, who was born here in A.D. 193 and whose arch of triumph
greets visitors.
   With the decline of the Roman empire, Leptis eventually
succumbed to the raids of Germanic tribes that maintained a kingdom
in North Africa in the 5th century, then to Byzantine rule in the
4th century and finally to an Arab invasion in 642.
   Its name may derive from a Phoenician combination ``li'' and
``bada,'' meaning town at the edge of the desert. ``Magna'' _
meaning great in Latin _ has been added to distinguish the town
from another Leptis in Tunisia.
   Libya's rich collection of archaeological sites include
prehistoric cave paintings in the south, the ruins of a Greek site
called Sabratha west of Tripoli, and various relics from the series
of conquerors.
