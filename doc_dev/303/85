Magna International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, posted
record sales and earnings for the third quarter ended April 30, reflecting
strong north American car sales, improved margins, lower finance costs and
greater efficiency.
The European plants are breaking even and are expected to pick up with the
economy.
Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 72.4m or Dollars 1.18 a share, up 63
per cent from a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1bn, up 36 per cent. The
quarterly dividend is being raised to 26 cents a share from 20 cents.
Nine-month net profit rose 68 per cent to CDollars 169.2m or CDollars 2.82 a
share on sales up 29 per cent to CDollars 2.5bn.
Capital outlay was CDollars 135m in the third quarter, including buying
Austria's Zipperle and 11 per cent of Atoma in North America from
Mitsubishi. Zipperle has sales of about CDollars 150m. Magna sells parts and
assemblies to car and light truck makers.
