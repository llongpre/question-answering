MAGNA International, the biggest independent Canadian car parts producer,
recorded a 46 per cent jump in third-quarter profit. The group added that it
would be debt-free by July 31.
Net profit was CDollars 44.4m (USDollars 34.9m), or CDollars 1 a share,
against CDollars 30.5m, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced 13
per cent to CDollars 742m.
Profits for the nine-month period rose 51 per cent to CDollars 101m, or
CDollars 2.34, from CDollars 66.7m, or CDollars 2.13, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 13 per cent to CDollars 2bn.
Magna, with plants in Canada, the US and Europe, is benefiting from stronger
North American vehicle production. Its gross margin was 19.5 per cent in the
third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the second, but the group warned
that customer pricing pressures were increasing.
The fourth quarter, normally the weakest, should be buoyed by the North
American recovery and the big assemblers' shift to outsourcing of parts.
