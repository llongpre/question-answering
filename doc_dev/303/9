   Many British schoolteachers have trouble spelling,
can't do a simple sum and don't know West Germany's capital,
according to a survey published Sunday.
   The Sunday Times commissioned a general knowledge survey of 308
teachers in primary, junior high and high schools nationwide and
reported three-quarters of them could not spell ``embarrass,''
``satellite'' and ``harassment.''
   ``Almost all made mistakes over the 16 simple questions on
current affairs, geography, spelling, maths, science, history and
literature,'' said the weekly, which commissioned the telephone
survey from Market Opinion and Research International.
   ``The results of this survey would be laughable if they were not
so devastating,'' said Peter Dawson, general secretary of the
Professional Association of Teachers.
   The Sunday Times said a press officer at the Department of
Education also had difficulty spelling the three test words and
could not do the percentage question.
   The Sunday Times said the results of the survey might help
explain its poll two ago, which found that one in six British
adults could not find Britain on a map, half did not know how to
read a railway timetable and two-thirds could not spell
``embarrass.''
   One in five of the teachers surveyed did not know King John
signed the Magna Carta and 15 percent didn't know that ``The
Canterbury Tales'' was written by Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of
English poetry.
   Sixteen percent, including 22 of the 171 math and science
teachers queried, were unable to answer when asked: ``What is 15
percent of 10 pounds sterling?'' (answer: 1.50 pounds)
   Eleven percent of the teachers could not say how many
millimeters are in a meter (1,000) and one in 24 thought the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the militant and much publicized Northern Ireland
Protestant politician, was a Roman Catholic.
   One in five did not know Warsaw is the capital of Poland, 27
percent did not know that Bonn is the capital of West Germany, and
47 percent did not know that Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan.
Forty-two percent got all three capitals right.
   The reporter who wrote the story got everything right except the
one about the Magna Carta, traditionally regarded as the basis of
English liberties. He said he had no idea who signed it.
