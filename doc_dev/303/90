   From Margaret Thatcher to Francois Mitterrand: it
was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
   Or at least that's the opening of the celebrated book, Charles
Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' that the British prime minister
left as a farewell present for her French host as she departed the
economic summit Sunday.
   Thatcher, who ruffled her hosts with derogatory comments about
the French revolution when she arrived for the Paris summit, gave
Mitterrand a copy of the novel that contrasts revolutionary Paris in
1789 with the tranquility of London.
   Mrs. Thatcher insisted before returning to London that her
relationship with Mitterrand was ``excellent.''
   But she stuck to her view that the French revolution, which
sparked a reign of terror, was not the origin of the concept of
human rights.
   ``I can't change history, neither can you,'' she said at a press
conference.
   She dded that perhaps the original concept belonged to neither
Britain's Magna Carta of 1215 nor the French revolution.
   ``I pointed out that the first one was the Ten Commandments and
the Sermon the Mount,'' she said.
