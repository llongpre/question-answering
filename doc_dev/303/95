<LEADPARA>  THE Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan plans to gradually double the number of
tourists granted entry -- to 4,000 a year -- and this year will reduce the
rates it charges tour operators by an  average of about 13 percent.;    There
will be bigger cuts in some tour categories like trekking, which will fall by
about 27 percent in low season (December through February and in June), Bhutan
has announced.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Travelers' Advisory  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The government of the tiny country bordered by India and China wants to
privatize some sectors of the state-run tourist industry, starting with
trekking, which is to be organized by three local companies. Individuals as
well as groups will be allowed to visit Bhutan as tourists, although
individual travelers will have to follow a prearranged itinerary.;    Hotel
facilities are being improved -- there are three government hotels, two
tourist lodges, several guest houses and some private hotels used by tourists
during overflow periods.;    A brochure outlining tours can be had from a
company that specializes in travel to the kingdom, Bhutan Travel, 120 East
56th St., New York, N.Y. 10022; (212) 838-6382 or (800) 950-9908.; Morocco; 
(box) The State Department has issued a caution on travel to Morocco as a
result of "several violent demonstrations" in mid-December. Before visiting
Morocco (particularly Fez), check with the State Department; (202) 647-5225.;
Mexico;  (box) Mexico has a new, high-octane unleaded gasoline, called Magna
Sin, which is designed to reduce some of the country's heavy air pollution as
well as provide proper fuel for cars  from Canada and the United States.;   
Developed by Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, the brand has an octane
level of 87, the highest in the country. (In the United States, regular
unleaded has an octane level of 87; mid-grade, 89; and premium, 93.) Magna Sin
sells for about $1.28 a gallon, compared with $1 usually charged for other
unleaded gasolines, including one called Extra, which has been taken off the
market. The leaded brand, Nova, sells for about 91 cents a gallon.;    Magna
Sin is available throughout Mexico, according to Pemex. Specific routes where
it can be found, the company said, include Tijuana-Los Cabos, Manzanillo-San
Cristobal de las Casas, and between Mexico City and Acapulco, Oaxaca and
Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo.;    All 1991 cars made in Mexico must have catalytic
converters, allowing use of unleaded gasoline, under a new law that is
described as part of a government program to reduce air pollution in cities.;
Sweden;  (box) Sweden, already one of Europe's pricier destinations, completed
on Jan. 1 a phase-in of a value-added-tax increase, imposing a tax of nearly
25 percent on transportation services, including ferries, domestic airline
flights, train tickets and car rentals. They had previously been exempt.;   
The same assessment has been levied against hotels and restaurants since last
summer, as well as on merchandise. In the case of merchandise, tourists can
sometimes receive partial reimbursement of the tax.; Eastern Europe;  (box) At
a time when Eastern Europe is welcoming record numbers of visitors, the State
Department is cautioning Americans about travel to Romania. According to a
statement, "Large street demonstrations in urban areas such as Bucharest,
Timisoara and Brasov could involve significant unrest and be a potential
threat to the safety of foreign visitors." The agency is also warning that
public transit may be subject to disruption by strikes or labor unrest.
Visitors should "register and keep in close touch with the U.S. Embassy in
Bucharest."  </TEXT>
