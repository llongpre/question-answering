  [Text] The recently formed breakaway groups in the major 
leftist legal organizations are being funded by the government, 
according to exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison. The 
Netherlands-based Sison, in his renewed attacks against his 
critics, also accused columnist and University of the 
Philippines professor Alex Magno as being hired by the 
government to write anti-communist propaganda. 
  In a statement faxed to the INQUIRER yesterday, Sison said 
groups like the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, Demokratikong 
Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, and the Kapatirang Anak Pawis 
[Union of Filipino Workers, Democratic Peasants Movement of the 
Philippines, and the Brotherhood of Laborers] are being used by 
the government for propaganda against the Communist Party of the 
Philippines [CPP] and the National Democratic Front. 
  Magno laughed off the accusation, saying Sison should learn 
to be more tolerant of outside comments. "What does he want, no 
one comments on the CPP internal debate?" he asked, adding the 
debate has become a public issue.
