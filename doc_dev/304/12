  [Text] The provision of the Uruguay Round to which the 
Philippines committed, to convert quantitative restrictions on 
agricultural products into tariffs does not amend Republic Act 
No. 7606, known as the Magna Carta of Small Farmers. 
  This was the ruling made by Justice Secretary Franklin M. 
Drilon in reply to a query of Trade and Industry Secretary 
Rizalino S. Navarro. Drilon said "the Magna Carta provisions 
cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round." 
  While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the land 
in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been 
said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of 
international law will often be given effect in municipal courts 
since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it. 
  Citing the Salonga-Yap book on Public International Law, 
Drilon said, the fact that international law has been made part 
of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy 
of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere. 
  As retired Supreme Court Justice Edgardo J. Paras said in 
his 
work "International Law," in case of conflict between 
international law and the municipal law of the tribunal deciding 
the case, the municipal law shall prevail. 
  However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round 
is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the 
Constitution, "our reply to this particular query might be 
different if we are to consider and apply the American 
jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of 
Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may 
supersede a prior treaty." 
  Navarro also asked whether "non-implementation by the 
president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision 
of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest 
groups."
