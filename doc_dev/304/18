   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain today proposed that a 35-nation summit this fall adopt a
universal code of rights for Europe and North America.
   In a speech to Czechoslovakia's parliament - the country's first
democratically elected legislature in five decades - she also urged
that the 12-nation European Community offer full membership to
Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe's other new democracies as soon
as they have introduced Western-style economies.
   ``If we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the
west coast of the United States right across to the Soviet Far
East, that would give us the best guarantee of all for security -
because democracies don't go to war with each other,'' the British
leader said.
   Mrs. Thatcher also apologized for the 1938 Munich Treaty, in
which Britain endorsed Adolf Hitler's division of Czechoslovakia.
   ``We failed you in 1938, when a disastrous policy of appeasement
allowed Hitler to extinguish your independence,'' she said.
  Although Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill was quick to
repudiate the agreement, the British ``still remember it with
shame,'' she added.
   ``In contrast to 1938, the United States, Europe and, indeed,
the wider world have responded with an impressive display of unity
to Saddam Hussein's aggression,'' she said of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Turning to Alexander Dubcek, whose 1968 Prague Spring attempts
to create ``socialism with a human face'' were crushed by Soviet
tanks, Mrs. Thatcher also referred ruefully to the West's lack of
action then.
   ``The pictures of that brave venture are etched in our memory,
and our inability to help remains a burden on the free world's
conscience,'' she said.
   Dubcek is now president of Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the first British prime minister to visit
Czechoslovakia, is on a trip celebrating the downfall of communism
in Central Europe. She will also visit Hungary.
   Her visit followed one last week by French President Francois
Mitterrand, whose country also signed the Munich agreement
endorsing Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland in northern
Czechoslovakia.
   A year later Germany invaded Poland and World War II broke out.
   After her speech, Mrs. Thatcher walked to central Wenceslas
Square with Dubcek and President Vaclav Havel.
   The square is the heart of Prague's peaceful November revolution
and the British leader laid flowers at the statue of Bohemian
patron St. Wenceslas - the rallying point for most of the
revolution's protests.
   Crowds gathered despite the drizzle and applauded as Mrs.
Thatcher laid the flowers and then went over to shake hands with
several well-wishers.
   Before leaving Prague for Bratislava, she formally renamed a
nearby square Winston Churchill Square after Britain's World War II
leader. It was formerly named after Antonin Zapotocky, a post-war
Communist Party secretary.
   In Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, she planned to meet with
Slovak leaders before leaving for Budapest late today.
   Underlining her proposal for a 35-nation universal code of
rights, Mrs. Thatcher presented the assembly with a copy of
England's 13th century Magna Carta, which guaranteed basic freedoms
for the population.
   Mrs. Thatcher did not provide details of her proposal, but it
seemed to involve a document guaranteeing basic human rights.
   She said she wanted a ``European Magna Carta'' adopted at the
summit of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe to be held in Paris in November. The conference includes all
European countries, except Albania, in addition to the United
States and Canada.
   Mrs. Thatcher has urged repeatedly that the group become a key
consultative body for the new Europe and its relations with North
America following the collapse of Communist rule in most of the
East Bloc last year and reforms in the Soviet Union.
