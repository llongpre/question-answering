   It was the evening of David Hibbard's last day
as a Peace Corps volunteer in a mud-hut village in Nigeria when his
overseas radio crackled with the bulletin that John F. Kennedy had
been assassinated, and Hibbard's lonely nightmare began.
   ``I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and grief,'' said Hibbard,
now a doctor in Boulder, Colo. ``I stayed up all night listening for
details. I wondered irrationally whether he might have lived if I'd
stayed in Nigeria another year. I cried myself to sleep, exhausted.''
   Jim Hagan of Santa Cruz, Calif., recalls he was a youngster
trying to hitchhike out of a blizzard in Buffalo, N.Y., to attend
the president's funeral in Washington. He never made it, but he
joined the Peace Corps three years later for a stint in India.
   Kennedy, said Hagan, embodied the Peace Corps' ideal of ``helping
others, breaking down barriers ... and promoting peace instead of
war.''
   Hibbard and Hagan were among 450 former Peace Corps volunteers or
their surrogates who saluted Kennedy's memory during a 24-hour vigil
in the Capitol Rotunda which ended at midday Tuesday, the 25th
anniversary of the president's murder in Dallas.
   They joined hundreds of other former volunteers at a memorial
Mass at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, where the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh recalled Nov. 22, 1963, as the day when ``the
heartbeat of a nation stood still.''
   Americans across the land stood still for a moment Tuesday to
recall that dark day, although members of the Kennedy family said
they hoped the president could be remembered for his life, not his
death.
   ``I think we should think of the high points of his life, the
laughter and the vision,'' said Eunice Shriver, the president's
sister, who made an early-morning visit to his grave at Arlington
National Cemetery. ``Hopefully, someday we'll get excited about his
birthday.'' Kennedy would have been 71 last May 29.
   Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, appeared shortly after the
cemetery gates opened at 8 a.m. Later in the day, Evelyn Lincoln,
the president's personal secretary, laid three red roses before the
eternal flame. She has visited the site every Nov. 22 since the
assassination.
   Thirty uniformed men of the Army's elite Green Berets laid a
wreathe, formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in
chief.
   The president's youngest and only surviving brother, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., laid a single white rose at the Kennedy
memorial at Runnymede, England, where King John made a historic
grant of civil and political liberties in the Magna Carta.
   ``We think it's extremely important to celebrate the life of
President Kennedy rather than the tragedy,'' Kennedy told reporters.
``We're focusing on the birthday and the hope of his life rather
than dwelling upon his loss.''
   A private Mass was held for the president's widow, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, and her two children, John Jr. and Caroline, at St.
Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church in New York City. The former
first lady made no public appearances.
   In Dallas, no official ceremonies were held, but about 2,500
people gathered at Dealey Plaza to pray silently and observe the
site where Kennedy was killed by an assassin's gunfire as he waved
to crowds from the back of an open limousine.
   Twenty people clasped hands along the motorcade route. A crucifix
and two bouquets of flowers were left at the approximate spot on Elm
Street where the president was struck. Notes attached to the flowers
read ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22'' and ``After 25 years, we still
love you, John.''
   Schoolteacher Jean Hill, who witnessed Kennedy's murder a
quarter-century ago, brought her 50 third-graders to Dealey Plaza.
``I want my kids to know it does not take violence of any kind to
bring about change and that they themselves can be instruments of
change and it can be good,'' she said.
   Some cable television viewers relived the hours after the
assassination as the Arts &amp; Entertainment channel interrupted its
regular programming and played NBC News' actual coverage of the day
minute-by-minute exactly 25 years later.
   It started at around 2 p.m. just after the bullets were fired and
ended in the evening with events in Washington after President
Lyndon B. Johnson landed in the presidential plane that also brought
Kennedy's body and widow back to Andrews Air Force Base outside the
capital.
