   Magna International Inc. posted a 92% earnings decline for its first quarter ended Oct. 31 and predicted lower net income for all of fiscal 1988. 

   Canada's largest auto-parts manufacturer reported net income declined to 842,000 Canadian dollars ($644,635), or three cents a share, from 10.3 million dollars, or 41 cents, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 12% to 291.6 million dollars from 259.4 million dollars, despite an approximate 5% decline in production by North American car makers during the quarter, the company added. 

   Magna cited delays in the introduction of new vehicle models and problems in bringing certain of its new production plants to full efficiency for the earnings slump. 

   James McAlpine, Magna's executive vice president, said profit margins are expected to improve later this year, but it is "highly unlikely" that fiscal 1988 earnings will match the 40.3 million dollars, or 1.56 dollars a share, earned last year. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magna shares closed at $7.875, off 62.5 cents. 

   Also, shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday approved a plan that would allow Magna to take its operating divisions public. 
Mr. McAlpine said a major financial institution has agreed to acquire a fully diluted interest of between 15% and 20% in Magna's Cosma International Inc. unit for 50 million dollars, as a first step in possibly taking Cosma public. 
Details of the private placement will be announced next month. 
The Cosma unit makes automotive body systems. 

   Mr. McAlpine also disclosed that following the stock market crash in October, Magna established a program to help longtime employees who are nearing retirement and want to sell their Magna shares. 
Under the plan, these employees can sell their stock to the company at the average stock market price for Magna over the past five years, currently about 20 dollars.
