<LEADPARA>  Every day the bishop of Lincoln prays for a solution to what has been called
Lincoln Cathedral's most damaging dispute since King John's soldiers attacked
it in 1217.;    But neither prayer nor a professional counselor brought in to
calm the row over allegations of financial ineptitude have answered Bishop
Robert Hardy's entreaties.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We haven't resolved the issue," said the cathedral dean, Brandon Jackson.;
   The dean is fighting with his canons: Subdean Rex Davis, responsible for
cathedral finances; cathedral Chancellor John Nurser; Precentor David Rutter;
and Archdeacon Christopher Laurence.;    At issue: a disastrous attempt to
raise money by sending the cathedral's copy of the Magna Carta to Australia.
The dispute has been poisonous, and the police have been called in.;    At one
point, Jackson wrote to Davis: "I have found it virtually impossible to work
with you.";    Davis, in a statement leaked to the press, spoke of "innuendo,
dirty tricks, press leaks, threatening remarks and other unseemly and
demeaning behavior.";    Norman Leeds, assistant chief constable of
Lincolnshire police, said in November that police were looking into
allegations, but he did not spell them out.;    With Jackson, the canons are
responsible for running England's third-largest cathedral.;    A medieval
masterpiece, the hilltop cathedral dominates the city of Lincoln in eastern
England, 130 miles north of London.;    High in the cathedral's Angel Choir
squats the Lincoln Imp, symbol of the city. Set there by medieval masons, the
grinning little stone figure is said to have been sent by the devil to cause
trouble on Earth.;    The trouble at Lincoln started when Nurser, Rutter,
Laurence and the then-dean, Oliver Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, agreed to
Davis' proposal to exhibit the cathedral's Magna Carta, Latin for "Great
Charter," at the World Expo that opened April 1988 in Brisbane, Australia.;   
The document was signed by King John in 1215 under threat from his barons. A
foundation stone of English liberties, it granted church rights and individual
freedoms. Only four original manuscripts exist.;    The project aimed to raise
money for cathedral conservation but instead left it $108,600 worse off.;   
The Magna Carta pavilion attracted 900,000 people, but the venture lost money.
Last month, The Independent newspaper reported that the cathedral spent nearly
$2 million on arrangements in Brisbane, leaving a deficit of about $1.3
million. Expo officials waived most of the debts.;    Bishop Hardy wrote in a
report that accountants could trace no written record of cash counted in
Australia. He accused the Lincoln Chapter of financial ineptitude and said the
canons should consider resigning.;    Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes retired in
1989 and Jackson, then provost at Bradford Cathedral, was appointed to replace
him.;    Jackson, 56, began investigating the Australia trip and passed
details to the Church of England newspaper, the Church Times, which broke the
story in January 1990 under the headline, "How the Lincoln Chapter Burned Its
Fingers.";    Relations between Jackson and the canons deteriorated to the
point where they called in the bishop. The dean asked him to examine the
Australia visit. The canons asked him to investigate their relationship with
Jackson.;    Hardy's report last September said the attitude of the canons was
reprehensible and that they and the dean had conducted themselves shamefully
in the news media.;    "It all seems a very long way from Jesus of Nazareth,"
Hardy wrote.  </TEXT>
