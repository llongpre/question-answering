   Magna International Inc. named Manfred Gingl, its president and chief operating officer, to the additional post of chief executive officer. 

   Mr. Gingl, 39 years old, succeeds Frank Stronach, 55, who resigned as chief executive to pursue a political career. 
Mr. Stronach will "temporarily" retain the post of chairman, Magna said. 
A spokesman said it isn't clear when Mr. Stronach intends to resign as chairman. 

   Magna, a Markham, Ontario-based auto parts concern, also named James McAlpine to the newly created post of vice chairman. 
Mr. McAlpine, 42, will remain executive vice president and Magna's chief financial and administrative officer. 

   Mr. Stronach, who plans to seek the Liberal Party nomination for a seat in Parliament from Ontario's York-Simcoe district, will continue to advise Magna on charitable donations and employee relations issues only, a spokeswoman said.
