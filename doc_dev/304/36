MAGNA International, the Toronto-based automotive parts supplier, plans to
expand its European operations by investing about CDollars 100m (USDollars
76m) in an unidentified parts manufacturer.
Magna said yesterday that it was in talks which may result in it buying a
majority interest in an operating unit of the European group, and a minority
stake in a public company within the same group. It is also investigating
several other potential investments in Europe.
Magna officials declined yesterday to identify their target, beyond saying
that it is a large company. But Magna has a history of close co-operation
with German car and parts makers. It already has a 50 per cent stake in a
joint venture with Voest-Alpine of Austria which owns four parts factories
in Germany and Austria. Magna owns another factory of its own in Germany.
To finance the proposed acquisition, Magna also announced plans yesterday to
issue 3m common shares in the US and Canada at a price of CDollars 50.50 a
share. The issue will be underwritten in Canada by a group led by Richardson
Greenshields. Bids have been invited from US brokers.
Mr Paul Robinson, senior vice-president for finance, said the thrust into
Europe was prompted partly by potential benefits in the European market, but
also to cement 'stronger relationships with European customers as they move
into North America'. Magna already has contracts to supply BMW's new factory
in South Carolina.
Mr Robinson said the investment will also encourage a 'cross-fertilisation'
of technologies between European and North American auto-parts plants. A
substantial number of Magna's engineers and other senior managers are
Europeans.
Magna has recovered strongly from financial difficulties which pushed it
close to the brink in the late-1980s. It posted record profits of CDollars
140m on sales of CDollars 2.6bn in the year to July 31.
The share price dropped CDollars 1.25 in early trading yesterday on the
Toronto stock exchange to CDollars 52.25.
