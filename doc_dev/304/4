   Sen. Edward Kennedy led a group of
people Tuesday to a stone memorial for his slain brother and laid a
single white rose at the marker in a meadow where the Magna Carta
was signed.
   Kennedy traveled without advance publicity to the memorial 20
miles west of London, paid his respects with a handful of friends,
and was gone before other visitors arrived on the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
   The youngest of the Kennedy brothers placed the rose at the foot
of the stark, oblong memorial stone, crossed himself and silently
mouthed a prayer.
   In Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the anniversary of Kennedy's
death was marked by special television programs and newspaper
articles examining his legacy and the various conspiracy theories
surrounding his murder.
   West Berlin remembered Kennedy with special fondness for his 1963
visit and ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech expressing solidarity with
the city. Peter Rebsch, president of the West Berlin parliament,
laid a wreath outside city hall.
   West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, in a speech Monday night
marking the anniversary, said: ``Kennedy's visit and his speech were
unforgettable. His acknowledgment of Berlin as a symbol of freedom
helped cement the self-confidence of Berliners.''
   Vatican Radio remembered the ``tragic event that shook the world
and that hit at the heart of the American dream.''
   During his visit to Runnymeade, Edward Kennedy was accompanied by
three English friends of the Kennedy family Dinah Bridge, Lady Anne
Tree and Chiquita Astor.
   The Massachusetts Democrat also was joined by Americans James
Wyeth, painter of a celebrated posthumous portrait of the president,
and historical author Larry Collins.
   The weather was clear but freezing cold. As the small party
walked across a field away from the memorial, a supersonic Concorde
jet took off from nearby Heathrow Airport, a brilliant white dart
etched against the blue sky.
   The monument sits in a meadow at Runnymede, where in 1215 King
John signed the Magna Carta, or great charter, which would become
the cornerstone of Western civil liberties. It lies on the side of a
hill, not on the top, to symbolize a life cut short before its time.
   The 5-foot-high stone slab, paid for by public donations and
unveiled in 1965, is inscribed with Kennedy's words from his
inaugural address: ``We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet
any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe in order to
assure the survival and success of liberty.''
   Kennedy told The Associated Press the memorial had ``a special
meaning to all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to
come out with some of the close friends ... dear friends of
President Kennedy.''
   He declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th anniversary
of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's extremely important
to celebrate the life of President Kennedy rather than the tragedy.
We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and the hope of his life
rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   Doreen Ramsey, 64, and her 71-year-old husband Eric, drove more
than 100 miles from Bristol to visit the memorial.
   ``We felt as though the world had stopped,'' said Mrs. Ramsey,
remembering the assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   One man laid a wreath, said he was there ``to honor a very great
American,'' and broke down in tears, turning away quickly.
