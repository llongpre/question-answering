   Magna International Ltd., Toronto, said holders of its
public debentures approved an extension of the maturity date,
giving the auto parts maker more time to complete a debt
restructuring package.
   Magna, which has been plagued by overcapacity and a
downturn in the auto industry, said the extension affects 75
million Canadian dollars (US$64.7 million) of its 10.375%
unsecured debentures, Series 1, which were to have matured
last Monday. The new maturity date is Feb. 15. The company
said the annual interest rate on the securities, beginning
yesterday, will be equal to the highest level of interest
paid by Magna to any of its bank lenders; it didn't specify
the level.

   Magna initially proposed extending the maturity date on
the debentures to March 31. It also proposed raising the
interest rate to 13.25%. No reason was given for the change
in plans, and company officials weren't available to comment.
   Magna has proposed restructuring more than C$1 billion in
debt. It expects to raise about C$425 million by next July by
selling various assets and finding joint-venture partners for
certain operations.
