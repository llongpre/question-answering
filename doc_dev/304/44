MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, tripled
fourth quarter net profits and expects to benefit from a 5 to 10 per cent
rise in north American car production in fiscal 1993.
Profits for the fourth quarter to July 31 were CDollars 31.3m (USDollars
25.8m), or 82 cents a share, up from Dollars 11.6m, or 41 cents a share, a
year earlier, on sales of Dollars 625m, up 16 per cent.
Two years after a brush with failure, the restructured Magna reported a
profit of Dollars 98m, or Dollars 2.91 a share for the full year, up sixfold
from Dollars 16.5m, or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 2.4bn, up 17 per cent.
Magna attributed the strength in sales to rising north American vehicle
output and growth in the company's average production content. Magna also
operates several European plants.
Profits gained from higher plant operating rates and lower interest costs.
Debt has been halved to Dollars 274m, including a Dollars 165m convertible
debenture.
Magna plans to apply for a New York Stock Exchange quotation. It is paying a
10 cents a share dividend on the A and B stock on October 16.
Lac Minerals, a Canadian gold producer, is buying 52 per cent of the high
grade Lisheen zinc-lead property near Kilkenny, in Ireland, from Chevron
Corp for USDollars 70m.
