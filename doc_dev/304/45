   Magna International Inc., Toronto, said it plans to ask
holders of its public debentures for a second extension of
the issue's maturity date, to allow the auto parts maker more
time to complete a debt restructuring package.
   The extension would affect 75 million Canadian dollars
(US$64.4 million) of Magna's 10.375% unsecured debentures,
Series 1. The maturity date previously was extended to Feb.
15 from Dec. 31. Magna said its proposal for the further
extension would require 50% of the debentures' principal
amount to be repaid on May 31, with the balance due on Dec.
31.
