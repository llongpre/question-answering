   MARKHAM, Ontario -- Magna International Inc. said it plans
to issue up to 5.5 million Class A subordinate voting shares,
a move that would boost the company's share capital by 20.7%.
   Magna, which apparently has recovered much of its
financial health, said it would use the proceeds mainly to
pay down debt. The auto parts manufacturer had longterm debt
of 380.6 million Canadian dollars (US$338.9 million) at July
31.

   Recently, the company successfully restructured more than
C$1 billion in debt that had been in default. It also has
begun reporting profits after a series of losses that
followed an ambitious expansion program in the late 1980s and
a downturn in the North American auto industry.
   The company had net income of C$16.5 million, or 59
Canadian cents a share, in the fiscal year ended July 31. A
year earlier it posted a loss of C$224.2 million, or C$8.06 a
share. Revenue rose to C$2.02 billion from C$1.93 billion.
   Magna's stock has climbed steadily from a low of $1.688 a
share last November. In over-the-counter trading yesterday,
before news of the planned share offering was announced, the
stock closed at $16.75, up 50 cents.
   Magna said the lead underwriters for the share issue will
be Burns Fry Ltd. in Canada and First Boston Corp. in the
U.S.
