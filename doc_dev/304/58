   Magna International Inc. said it prepaid 100 million
Canadian dollars (US$87.4 million) of debt originally
scheduled to be paid to lenders Dec. 31.
   The Markham, Ontario, auto parts manufacturing concern
said it obtained funds for the repayment from a new C$75
million, two-year credit facility from a major bank, together
with cash from operations and the sale of non-strategic
assets.

   The company said the prepayment terminates all payment
obligations under its restructuring plan.
   Investors responded positively to the news, sending Magna
shares up in trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Magna Class A shares closed at C$14.13, up 50 Canadian cents.
