MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, continues
its recovery despite weak North American car production caused by the
recession.
For the second quarter to January the group reported net profits of CDollars
10.7m (USDollars 9m) or 26 cents a share, against losses of Dollars 2.3m, or
8 cents a year earlier. Sales were unchanged at Dollars 484m.
First-half profits came to CDollars 36.2m or 84 cents a share, against
CDollars 500,000 or 2 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.1bn, up
12 per cent.
Magna, which also has several plants in Europe, benefited from a shift in
product mix, lower interest rates and lower capital spending. Assuming
conversion of CDollars 200m of convertible debentures, debt-equity ratio is
0.6:1.
The company is resuming common share dividends with a 10 cent cash payment
for the latest quarter. Magna in the latest period achieved a return on
equity of 11 per cent after returning from the brink two years ago.
