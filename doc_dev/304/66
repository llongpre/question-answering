   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
today left Aspen for a meeting in Washington with President Bush
after a five-day visit shortened by the Kuwait invasion and a
terrorist bombing at home.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived Aug. 1, shortened her scheduled
10-day visit to this mountain resort so she could attend the
funeral Wednesday of Ian Gow, a conservative member of Parliament
slain by an Irish Republican Army bomb on June 30.
   The trip was trimmed further to make time to meet Bush. She was
scheduled to return home on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke Sunday to more than 3,000 people at the 40th
anniversay of the Aspen Institute, a group dedicated to humanistic
values worldwide.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's bold takeover of tiny neighbor
Kuwait dominated concerns during her visit. Bush met with her
Thursday to discuss the invasion before he delivered the
anniversary celebration's opening speech.
   The United Nations must work to end the Mideast occupation, she
said.
   ``Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the
U.N. stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel
safe again. The law of the jungle takes over,'' she said.
   She also proposed human rights guarantees for all of Europe
similar to those established in Britain's Magna Carta, which
protects freedom of speech, religion, law and commerce, and the
right to hold democratic elections, own property and maintain
nationhood.
   Mrs. Thatcher said all Europeans deserve to remain free from
``fear of an over-mighty state.''
   She also suggested that the European Community should be
prepared to accept all Eastern European nations for full membership.
   ``We don't see this new Soviet Union as an enemy, but as a
country groping its way towards freedom,'' she said. ``We no longer
have to view the world through the prism of East-West relations.
The Cold War is over.''
   During her stay, Mrs. Thatcher visited the ``Star Wars''
Strategic Defense Initiative center and the North American
Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs and the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.
   Mrs. Thatcher received the institute's Statesman Award for
contributions to democracy and peace.
   The award has been given twice before in the institute's 40-year
history _ to Jean Monnet, founder of the European economic
integration, and former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Founded in 1950, the nonprofit institute gathers leaders in all
parts of society to discuss critical issues in the world. The
symposium this weekend concentrated on topics ranging from health
care to education.
