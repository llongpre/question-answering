   A team of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was
welcomed here by schoolchildren and residents Saturday, arriving to
begin monitoring compliance with the treaty to eliminate
medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The inspectors will monitor the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile
plant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced.
   A group of U.S. inspectors arrived in the Soviet Union on Friday
under the treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in December.
   The 22 Soviet missile experts and linguists arrived at the Utah
Air National Guard field at the Salt Lake International Airport
aboard an Air Force C-141 cargo plane at about 3 p.m.
   The Soviet team was part of a contingent of 70 missile
specialists who arrived at Travis Air Force Base in California on
Friday night.
   The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the only
permanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years under
the terms of the treaty.
   Early Sunday, the 48 other inspectors were to leave the air base
to conduct spot checks at as many as five missile sites in
California, Utah, Colorado and Arizona.
   A U.S. team, meanwhile, has arrived in the Soviet city of
Votkinsk, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20
missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under
the treaty.
   The Soviets arriving in Utah were greeted by a small group of
local residents, including about a dozen Magna elementary school
children, who held signs reading ``Welcome to Magna.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Anatoly Samarin, the leader of
the inspection team, said the time had come to effect the terms of
the treaty to eliminate Soviet and U.S. intermediate missiles.
   ``It is generally accepted that the INF Treaty is an important
stage in the relations between our two countries, a first step
towards the saving of mankind from the threat of nuclear
annhilation,'' he said in a brief, prepared statement.
   ``We should not be cynical or euphoric aboutthis process,'' said
Marine Col. George Connell of the On-Site Inspection Agency. ``It's
not the millenium, but it is an important step in the peace
process.''
   The Soviets mingled briefly with the children, shaking hands and
passing out Russian pocket calendars before boarding a bus to their
apartments in suburban Salt Lake City, where they will stay there
until quarters are built for them in Magna.
   The all-male contingent traveled to the Utah without wives and
families. They will be rotatd periodically with other Soviets, but
Kirk Van Leeuwen, logistics manager for the OSIA, said the schedule
will be up to the Soviets.
   The apartment building where the Soviets are staying has been
restricted and is off-limits to the news media, Van Leeuwen said.
``They asked for privacy just to unload,'' he said. ``They`re
tired.''
   The ``baseline inspections'' to be conducted within the next two
months are designed to verify the exact number of missiles and
related components to be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviet inspectors arrived with a 10-member air crew aboard
an Aeroflot jetliner at Travis on Friday, the same day 20 American
inspectors left for Moscow and Votkinsk.
   At the Magna plant, which made Pershing missile rocket motors,
the Soviets have the right to monitor the plant's gates for up to
13 years. The U.S. may station inspectors for the same period at a
Votkinsk plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most
important Soviet weapon to be eliminted under the treaty.
   The Soviets were scheduled to announce late Saturday which of
the five sites they will visit to conduct the baseline spot checks.
The five are a General Dynamics Corp. plant in San Diego; the
Army's Dugway Proving Ground in western Utah; the Pueblo Army Depot
in Pueblo, Colo.; Fort Huachuca, Ariz.; and Davis-Monthan Air Force
Base near Tucson, Ariz.
   Altogther, there are 26 missile sites in the U.S. and Western
Europe and 133 sites in the Soviet Union, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia that are open to inspection under the treaty.
   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated
verification procedures.
