<HEAD>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dead at 61</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William V. Shannon, a journalist and college
professor who served as U.S. ambassador to Ireland under President
Carter, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 61.
   ``His experience in foreign affairs and as a journalist and
writer and editorial writer for The New York Times brought not only
a vast experience, but a very high level of achievement to bear in
his classes,'' said Boston University President John Silber. ``He
was an inspiration to our students, a stimulation to our colleagues
and a productive and witty colleague. The loss to the university is
very great.''
   Shannon taught a course on the American presidency and conducted
graduate seminars in journalism upon his return from Ireland in
early 1981.
   He also was a regular contributing columnist to The Boston Globe
on various topics, foreign and domestic.
   Before Carter appointed him ambassador, Shannon had spent
1964-1977 as an editorial writer with the Times. Before that, he
was a reporter for the New York Post and received the New York
Newspaper Guild's Page 1 Award for his coverage of the
Army-McCarthy congressional hearings in 1954.
   His books include ``The American Irish,'' a history of
immigration from Ireland to the United States; ``They Could Not
Trust The King,'' an account of the Watergate hearings; and ``Our
Soverign State'' and the best-selling ``The Truman
Merry-Go-Round,'' both written with co-author Robert S. Allen.
   Born in Worcester, the son of immigrants from County Clare,
Ireland, Shannon graduated magna cum laude from Clark University in
1947 at the age of 19 and earned a master's degree in American
History at Harvard University the next year.
   Shannon is survived by his wife, three sons and other family
members.
