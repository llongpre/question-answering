FT  10 SEP 93 / Decision on Hurd's Maastricht 'treason' hangs with CPS

IT WAS, as Hexham magistrate Mrs Muriel Bowman observed, 'a procedure we
rarely see'.
Normally, at 9.30 am on Thursdays, the magistrates court in the
Northumberland market town hears nothing more momentous than applications
for drinks licences.
However, yesterday's business was special - a last-ditch attempt to throttle
the Maastricht treaty by laying seven charges of treason against the
ministers who signed it: Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and the
former Treasury minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death
penalty under UK law.
The men behind the move, businessman and Conservative political economist Mr
Rodney Atkinson - older brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Freedom
Association chairman Mr Norris McWhirter, earnestly addressed Mrs Bowman.
The massed media - the people of Hexham being conspicuously absent - sat
entranced.
The statutes they handed over were impressive, from the Coronation Oath Act
of 1953 and the 1795 Treason Act to the Magna Carta. Mr Atkinson submitted
that the signing of the Maastricht treaty was contrary to laws and statutes
of the United Kingdom going back over many centuries.
Mrs Bowman played it with a straight bat. She passed it on to the Crown
Prosecution Service.
After the three-minute hearing Mr Atkinson insisted the challenge was
serious. 'My brother is in the business of comedy, I'm afraid on this
occasion I'm in the business of tragedy, a democratic tragedy for the
British people unless this Maastricht treaty is overturned.'
Mr McWhirter threatened a judicial review if the CPS does not act. But did
they really want to see Mr Hurd in the Tower of London? 'The Queen can
always exercise the prerogative of mercy, provided of course by that time
she's not Mrs Elizabeth Windsor, European citizen,' suggested Mr McWhirter.
If their main target was worried, there was no sign of it; he was 300 miles
away at a Downing Street cabinet meeting and was not represented in court.
It was all very civil but then Hexham, chosen for its nearness to Mr
Atkinson's family home and distance from the London political establishment,
has been pretty quiet for the last few centuries since the border wars
between England and Scotland calmed down.
The demonstrators, flanked by banners - 'Hang Hurd High', 'Rodney is Right'
 -were undeterred. Should Mr Hurd hang? 'Yes, absolutely,' said one. 'It's
no more than the government deserves.'
