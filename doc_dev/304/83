   MAGNA INTERNATIONAL Inc., Markham, Ontario, said it
expects to raise 90.8 million Canadian dollars (US$80.5
million) from a previously announced offering of 5.5 million
Class A subordinate voting shares, which represent 20.7% of
the shares currently outstanding. The issue, which is being
underwritten by Burns Fry Ltd. of Toronto, was priced at
C$16.50 (US$14.62) a share. Magna, an automotive parts
manufacturer, said the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
