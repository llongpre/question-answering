   In the fringes of Paris summitry, Britain and France
are playing out old rivalries, sniping about everything from the
significance of the French Revolution to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's right-wing policies.
   Amid the greetings, the banquets and the parades marking the
celebration of the revolution's 200th anniversary and the start of
the summit of the seven major industrialized democracies, the
British-French exchanges are becoming increasingly less fraternal.
   Mrs. Thatcher began the latest spat, telling France's Le Monde
newspaper that the overthrow of the French monarchy did not initiate
the concept of human rights: Britain with the 1215 Magna Carta and
America with the 1776 Declaration of Independence did that long
before _ and without a bloody reign of terror.
   Michel Rocard, France's socialist premier, came back sharply
Friday, saying in an interview here with British television that
while he admired Britain's democratic traditions, the conservative
Mrs. Thatcher's policies were heading toward ``social cruelty.''
   ``I am _ and Mrs. Thatcher is well aware of the fact _ concerned
about the British government's trend toward social cruelty, which I
fear may damage the relationship between Britain's different social
classes and regions and in time possibly even the very quality of
Britain's political democracy,'' said Rocard.
   As news of his interview broke here, a British spokesman produced
figures contrasting the Britain's unemployment rate of 6.3 percent,
down from 10.2 percent in 1987, with France's 10 percent, scarcely
changed from two years ago.
   ``They've really made very little progress since 1987,'' said the
British spokesman, requesting anonymity.
   Asked how Mrs. Thatcher felt about Rocard's remarks, he added
coolly, ``I'm not even sure she is aware of them.''
   Before arriving Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher told Le Monde that
through Britain's history ``Parliament imposed its will on the
monarchy,'' which continues to flourish in Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher is also putting a damper on French President
Francois Mitterrand's attempts to turn the Paris summit into a
dialogue between the rich countries and some 30 Third World heads of
government he invited to the bicentennial celebration.
   Mitterrand responded warmly to a call by four Third World
countries for a North-South conference on ways to help debtor
countries handle crippling burdens.
   British officials immediately told reporters that Mrs. Thatcher
saw no need for such a conference, or any new initiative, and that
commercial banks and debtor nations should get on and settle the
problems under initiatives already agreed to.
   Asked about the atmosphere between Mitterrand and Thatcher, who
clashed last month about European monetary union at a European
Economic Community summit, the British spokesman replied simply,
``Very good.''
   When Mrs. Thatcher arrived for the start of the bicentennial
celebration, she was greeted by boos, mingled with applause, from
the watching crowd of Parisians.
   British officials shrugged this off. ``Sounds just like home,''
quipped one.
   But Britain's opposition socialist Labor Party, now well ahead of
Mrs. Thatcher's party in the polls, accused her of making an
``eccentric spectacle'' of herself with her ``offensive'' comments
about the French revolution.
   In a statement in London, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman,
Gerald Kaufman, said he wondered if she ``has gone mad.''
   ``Such conduct is, of course, extremely offensive to the French
people, who are taking part in an historic national celebration,''
Kaufman.
   ``It is even more worrying for the British people ... who now
watch with incredulity as the British prime minister makes an
eccentric spectacle of herself in front of the world,'' added
Kaufman.
   ``I can only conclude that Mrs. Tahtcher sees herself as a 20th
century Marie Antoinette who, faced with the justified complaint of
the electorate she misrule, airily replies: `Let them eat pate'.''
