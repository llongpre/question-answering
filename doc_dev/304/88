Magna, the Canadian-based car parts group, doubled second-quarter profits,
mainly because of surging North American vehicle production.
Net income reached a record CDollars 49.7m (USDollars 37m) or 82 cents a
share, up from CDollars 24.7m, or 46 cents a year earlier, on sales of
CDollars 778m, up 30 per cent.
First-half profit was CDollars 96.8m, or CDollars 1.64 a share, up 72 per
cent, on sales of CDollars 1.52bn, up 25 per cent.
Mr Frank Stronach, chairman, estimates total fiscal 1994 sales could reach
CDollars 4bn, up 54 per cent from fiscal 1993.
Magna's production base is mainly North America but it is expanding in
Europe, where it has sales of about Dollars 500m.
