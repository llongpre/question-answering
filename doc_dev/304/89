   Frank Stronach said he intends to resign as chief executive officer of Magna International Inc. to seek nomination as a candidate in Canada's next federal election. 

   Mr. Stronach said he plans to resign "over the next few weeks" and intends to name a successor as chief executive from the current management team of the auto parts company. 
He said he will retain his post as chairman, and that he will seek nomination as a Liberal Party candidate for Parliament in one of three districts in the York region near here. 

   Mr. Stronach, 55 years old, said he won't have an operating role with Magna, a company that he formed. 
He said his controlling interest in the company will be placed "in a foundation" after his resignation as chief executive. 

   Mr. Stronach has hinted for months that he intends to seek political office. 
He said he is mainly motivated by his opposition to the proposed Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, which he said "will be very detrimental to Canada." 
Mr. Stronach wouldn't elaborate. 
He said he will comment further when he announces in about 10 days the district from which he will seek nomination.
