FT  20 JUL 94 / Britons still walk a mile for a pint

Mr John Major's dream of a return to a Britain of warm beer and cricket on
the village green was given a boost yesterday by news that the traditional
pint of milk on the doorstep and pint of beer in a pub will live on.
From October 1 next year the UK will move into line with the rest of the
European Union by adopting metric measures for most purposes. But beer and
cider will still be sold in pint rather than half-litre measures - provided
these are in returnable containers - while road signs will stay in miles
rather than kilometres.
Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday he had laid
before parliament statutory instruments to implement the European Units of
Measurement directive. But the legislation provided for a handful of the
most popular imperial measures - some first standardised just after the
signing of the Magna Carta - to continue to be used.
Past reluctance from the public and from traders to adopt metric measures
led to the UK being granted a special exemption from the weights and
measures directive.
However most goods that are not already sold in metric measures will have to
conform from next year.
The main exceptions will be foods such as meat, poultry, fish and cheese,
which are sold loose by the pound and ounce. These will not have to switch
to metric until 2000.
The imperial measures that will continue beyond that are the mile, yard,
foot and inch for road-traffic signs and distance and speed measurement; the
pint for milk, draught beer and cider sold in returnable containers; the
troy ounce for precious metals; and the acre for land registration.
Consumers fearing confusion should take heart. Retailers will display price
conversion charts for goods sold in metric quantities.
