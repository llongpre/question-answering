<P>
When the leaders of the 34 nations of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) convene next Monday around a pale, oval-shaped 
table in Kleber Center in Paris, it will mark the official end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting will also signal the start of the construction of a New 
Europe -- with the heads of government playing a role not unlike their 
predecessors at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which reorganized the Continent 
after the Napoleonic Wars. 
</P>
<P>
The national boundaries redrawn at that historic, 19th-Century conference 
basically stood for 40 years. And while next week's CSCE meeting has no such 
sweeping brief, it does bring together in a harmonious mood former bitter 
antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
A centerpiece of the three-day summit will be the signing of an unprecedented 
treaty sharply reducing conventional arms deployed in Europe by East and West 
-- a goal believed hopelessly visionary not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
And after the ceiling lights dim and the television crews pack up, a small new 
CSCE Secretariat, probably based in Prague, will address itself to the 
nitty-gritty implementation of the lofty goals that will be enunciated in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
These will include what some call a new Magna Carta, named for the 775-year-old 
agreement between the English king and his subjects which served as the 
foundation for democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be taking concrete steps afterward for the broad ideas the summit will 
espouse," said U.S. Ambassador John J. Maresca, representative to the CSCE 
Summit Preparatory Committee, which has been laboring in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"These involve a document stating a commitment to human rights as a basis for 
government, free elections, and establishing a market system as the best way 
toward economic prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end -- in addition to the small CSCE secretariat of about 10 
staffers -- officials will be manning a Conflict Prevention Center to stave off 
regional quarrels (probably to be set up in Vienna); establishing a CSCE 
mechanism to monitor national elections (probably in Warsaw); and setting up 
regular consultations of the 34 foreign ministers, probably twice a year, as 
well as summit meetings of the heads of government every other year. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to appoint a semi-permanent CSCE parliamentary 
body, probably consisting of representatives from member nations' legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
And in Vienna immediately afterward, a new round of CFE talks will begin, which 
will attempt to reduce in a binding treaty the number of troops allowed in 
Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE is not without its critics: Some officials fear a premature push for a 
CSCE that would take over military security responsibilities in Europe. Others 
warn that a permanent CSCE organization runs the risk of becoming an impotent 
"talking shop," which will be unable to make fast and firm decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE began life in Helsinki in 1972 when it was set up to deal with three 
main areas or "baskets" of issues: military security, economic cooperation, and 
human rights. There were 35 CSCE members then -- all the European states except 
Albania, along with the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. This year, 
the number dropped to 34 with the unification of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The first CSCE agreement was the Helsinki Final Act signed in 1975 -- which 
established so-called "confidence-building measures" between East and West, set 
standards for human rights, and endorsed existing European boundaries. There 
have been follow-up CSCE meetings, in Belgrade (1977-78), Madrid (1980-83), and 
Stockholm (1984-86), but the Paris summit promises to be dramatically different 
from all the others. 
</P>
<P>
"The Paris summit," commented U.S. Ambassador Maresca, "will really be a 
celebration of the end of the Cold War."
