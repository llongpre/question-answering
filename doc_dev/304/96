   Americans crossing the Atlantic this year can get
a real feeling of what it was like in southern England when Britain
stood alone against the Luftwaffe 50 years ago.
   It was World War II leader Sir Winston Churchill who named the
struggle the Battle of Britain even before it began.
   As it was being fought in the summer of 1940, he said of the few
hundred Royal Air Force pilots from 19 nations who clashed head-on
with hordes of German bombers and their protecting screens of
fighters: ``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed
by so many to so few.''
   From April to October this year, exhibitions and air displays
will recall that summer when the Hurricanes and Spitfires met the
enemy air fleets pouring in from airfields in newly conquered
northeast France.
   The biggest ground effort marking the 50th anniversary of the
four months' combat in the sky is the ``Battle of Britain
Experience'' at the Royal Air Force Museum, April 11-Oct. 31.
   The museum at historic Hendon airfield in north London can be
reached from Colindale Underground station (Northern line) or Mill
Hill train station. Buses will shuttle from the two stations to the
museum throughout the summer.
   Sound recordings made in 1940 of air raid sirens, the whine of
aircraft and the distant crackle of machine guns usher visitors to
the museum into a labyrinth of relics, photographs, an entire
operations control room as it was at the height of the battle, and
the aircraft that took part.
   ``Besides a Hurricane and a Spitfire, we have the best
collection of German aircraft in the world,'' said spokesman
Michael Tagg.
   ``Visitors can see the Messerschmitt 109 and 110 fighters, the
Heinkel 111 and Junkers 87 and 88 bombers and even an Italian Fiat
C.R. 42, which made a forced landing during the only raid by the
Italian air force.''
   The biggest anniversary in the air is Sept. 15, when Queen
Elizabeth II will be on the Buckingham Palace balcony as a 12-mile
column of 163 veteran and modern aircraft flies above. Survivors of
``The Few'' will line up in front of the palace.
   Here are some other places to go:
   At London's Imperial War Museum is Spitfire R6915, which shot
down two German aircraft in the battle; plans of the German
invasion that never took place, the story of radar, flying
equipment and medals and, in the bookshop, a dossier of reproduced
documents selling for about $14.
   Visitors giving notice the day before can browse in the library
among scores of books about the battle and British and German
records of it.
   Don't miss Paul Nash's painting of a typical scene in the battle
_ contrails over the English countryside.
   At Duxford, a battle airfield near Cambridge and 56 miles
northwest of London, is the Imperial War Museum's huge collection
of aircraft of both world wars, including Spitfires and Hurricanes.
   ``The whole place is an exhibit,'' said Tagg. ``We restored it
exactly as it was on Sept. 19, 1940, and visitors can see how its
squadrons were controlled.''
   Duxford will stage an airshow of fighter planes July 8.
   The Cabinet War Rooms in London, built underground for
protection from air raids close to the prime minister's official
residence in Downing Street, displays 21 historic rooms that served
as headquarters for Churchill, the war Cabinet and the chiefs of
staff, with desks, bunks, maps, telephones and files just as they
were at the war's end in 1945.
   Close by is Westminster Abbey with its Battle of Britain Chapel,
its wall still marked by German bomb shrapnel.
   At the port of Dover, the battle's front line, a complex of
tunnels in the chalk cliffs is being opened to show operations
rooms and where townspeople sheltered from raids.
   Less than 10 miles from Dover is Folkestone, and nearby is
Hawkinge airfield, an RAF base during the battle. It has a museum
of British and German aircraft relics, mementoes of such aces as
Robert Stanford Tuck and Al Deere, all the weapons used in the
battle by both sides, and equipment and uniforms donated by British
and German pilots.
   Visitors interested in buying relics can attend two auctions: on
Sept. 13 at Bentley Priory in Stanmore, northwest London,
headquarters of the British commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh
Dowding (the only time the building will open the public) and on
Sept. 15 at the RAF Museum in Hendon.
   Dowding's statue is in London outside St. Clement Danes, the RAF
headquarters church.
   Americans can make a pilgrimage to aptly named Gravesend, 25
miles east of London, to see the grave of Detroit-born Hugh
Reilley, shot down in his Spitfire by German ace Werner Moelders.
   Reilley was one of a handful of Americans to get into the battle
when the United States was still neutral.
   All the airmen in the battle are commemorated in a memorial at
Runnymede, 21 miles west of London, where memorials to Magna Carta
and U.S. President John F. Kennedy are also located.
   The Battle of Britain resulted from Hitler's determination to
force the country to surrender. Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering
told him he could force Britain to its knees: his fighters would
shoot the Royal Air Force out of the sky while his bombers would
destroy RAF airfields, aircraft production factories, and docks.
   But although the RAF was outnumbered 4 to 1 in aircraft, it was
fighting close to its bases, it could rescue more pilots and
salvage more planes than the Germans, the German codes had been
broken and the radar early warning system pinpointed the location
of the approaching enemy air fleets.
   The RAF came close to defeat, but the Germans did not know that,
and German losses in aircraft and men in the daylight battles were
so unexpected that the Luftwaffe turned to night bomber raids on
British cities.
   According to the comprehensive account in the book, ``The Battle
of Britain Then and Now,'' the Luftwaffe lost 2,662 airmen killed
and 1,887 aircraft, while the RAF lost 537 airmen killed and 1,023
aircraft.
   There are many books on the battle. Recommended are ``Fighter''
by thriller-writer Len Deighton and ``The Narrow Margin'' by Derek
Wood and Derek Dempster.
   The British Tourist Authority can supply a list of main events
of the anniversary year.
