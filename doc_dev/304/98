Norway's King Olav V, at 87 Europe's oldest reigning monarch, has been 
hospitalized in Oslo with inflammation of the heart but is likely to leave in a 
few days, spokesmen said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The king is in no danger," his secretary, Magne Hagen, said. 
</P>
<P>
"He will probably be out in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
King Olav was hospitalized Tuesday night for observation of a slight 
inflammation of the lining around the heart. 
</P>
<P>
He has had a string of official engagements in recent days and attended a 
commemoration in northern Norway on Monday of the 50th anniversary of the first 
Allied victory of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A great-grandson of Britain's Queen Victoria, King Olav ascended the throne in 
1957. For many Norwegians, he is a symbol of resistance to the Nazi occupation 
of Norway during World War II. As crown prince, he fled to Britain in 1940.
