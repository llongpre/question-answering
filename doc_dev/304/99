   I cherish, too, the hope that what we have done together
throughout this decade and in Moscow this week has helped bring
mankind along the road of that pilgrimage. If this be so, prayerful
recognition of what we're about as a civilization and a people, has
played its part. I mean, of course, the great civilized ideas that
comprise so much of your heritage. The development of law embodied
by your constitutional traditions, the idea of restraint on
centralized power and individual rights, as established in your
Magna Carta. The idea of representative government as embodied by
the mother of all Parliaments.
   But we go beyond even this. Your own Evelyn Waugh, who reminded
us that civilization _ and by this I do not mean talking cinemas
and tinned food nor even soldiery and hygenic houses _ but the
whole moral and artistic organization of Europe, has not in itself
the power of survival. It came into being, he said, through the
Judeo-Christian tradition, and without it, has no significance or
power to command allegiance. It is no longer possible, he wrote, to
accept the benefits of civilization and at the same time deny the
supernatural basis on which it rests.
   And so it is first things we must consider. And here it is a
story _ one last story _ that can remind us best of what we're
about. It's a story that a few years ago came in the guise of that
art form for which I had an understandable affection, the cinema.
It's a story about the 1920 Olympics and two British athletes _
Harold Abrahams, a young Jew whose victory, as his immigrant
Arab-Italian coach put it, was a triumph for all those who have
come from distant lands and found freedom and refuge here in
England.
   And Eric Lidell, a young Scotsman who would not sacrifice
religious conviction for fame. In one unforgettable scene, Eric
Lidell reads the words of Isaiah. `He giveth power to the faint and
to them that have no might, he increased their strength. But they
that waiteth on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall
mount up, with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary.'
   Here, then, is our formula for completing our crusade for
freedom. Here, the strength of our civilization and our belief in
the rights of humanity. Our faith is in a higher law. Yes, we
believe in prayer and its power. And like the founding fathers of
both our lands, we hold that humanity was meant not to be
dishonored by the all-powerful state, but to live in image and
likeness of Him who made us.
   More than five decades ago when an American president told his
generation that they had a rendezvous with destiny, at almost the
same moment, a prime minister asked the British people for their
finest hour. This rendezvous, this finest hour, is still upon us.
Let us seek to do His will in all things, to stand for freedom, to
speak for humanity. Come my friends, as it was said of old by
Tennyson, it is not too late to seek a newer world.
   Thank you.
