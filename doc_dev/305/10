The House of Representatives is poised to take a major step backward in the 
fight against violent crime. In a bill purporting to be an anti-crime measure, 
the House Judiciary Committee has sent to the floor a proposal that would 
effectively abolish the death penalty in this country. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the death penalty is a just 
punishment for the most heinous crimes. Thirty-six states have adopted capital 
punishment. Yet, for more than a decade, these laws have been rendered almost 
unenforceable by a system that allows convicted murderers to delay 
indefinitely, and ultimately to avoid, imposition of their sentences. After 
exhausting all appeals, murderers are allowed to file endless habeas corpus 
petitions in state and federal court, raising largely technical challenges to 
their convictions and sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of habeas corpus originally was a legal device used to challenge 
attempts by the government to seize and detain an individual without trial. 
During the Warren court era, the writ was converted into a right to multiple 
appeals of issues already decided. This radical expansion of the scope of 
habeas corpus has allowed inmates sentenced to death to nullify their sentences 
through strategic delay. 
</P>
<P>
As of 1988, the average delay from time of sentencing to time of execution of a 
capital sentence was almost seven years. In that same year 296 individuals were 
convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death while only 11 capital 
sentences were actually carried out. Obviously, such delay undermines the 
deterrent and retributive force of the death penalty and breeds frustration and 
disrespect for our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Robert Alton Harris illustrates the point. In 1978, while on parole 
for voluntary manslaughter, Harris shot two teen-age boys to steal their car 
for a robbery. Later, he confessed to the murders. He was convicted of 
first-degree murder and sentenced to death by a California jury in 1979. In 
1981, the California Supreme Court upheld this conviction and sentence, finding 
that "none of the many contentions raised by (Harris) has merit." Since that 
time, Harris has filed several state and four federal habeas petitions, each of 
which has been rejected. His sentence has still not been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of jurists chaired by retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. has offered a 
solution to this problem. If a state provides those on Death Row with counsel 
at state expense in state habeas corpus proceedings, the prisoner will get only 
two "bites at the apple" -- one state proceeding and one full federal review. 
No further habeas corpus petitions could be filed unless a claim of factual 
innocence were raised. The Bush Administration, the National Assn. of Attorneys 
General and the National District Attorneys Assn. support the principles behind 
Justice Powell's reform proposals. The House bill, far from curing present 
abuses, would make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
First, the House proposal rejects the Powell Committee's quid pro quo 
principle. It affirmatively encourages the filing of successive habeas corpus 
petitions containing claims unrelated to guilt or innocence. At the same time, 
it imposes requirements for state-appointed counsel that very few lawyers can 
meet and even fewer state taxpayers can afford. Under the House proposal, 
convicted murderers like Harris would go on avoiding punishment by raising 
alleged technical "defects" in their sentences -- "defects" that have nothing 
to do with their guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the House proposal overrules two recent Supreme Court decisions that 
attempt to provide some reasonable safeguards against habeas corpus abuse. In 
Teague vs. Lane, the Supreme Court held that prisoners cannot use habeas corpus 
to challenge their convictions based on judicial decisions that were not even 
rendered at the time of their trial and appeals. The House proposal overrules 
Teague, and thus renders every criminal conviction in the nation subject to 
constant challenge based on cases that have not yet even been decided. The 
Judiciary Committee proposal also overrules the court's decision in Wainwright 
vs. Sykes. The Sykes decision requires that defendants follow state procedural 
rules in order to preserve claims for federal review, thus preventing criminal 
defendants from "sandbagging," that is, from holding back their claims in state 
court only to raise them years later in a federal proceeding. The House 
proposal would effectively reward defendants who ignore state procedural rules. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to openly and honestly oppose the death penalty outright -- a 
position the American people have rejected. It is another thing entirely to 
proclaim support for the death penalty in order to curry political favor while 
at the same time voting to erect a labyrinth of procedural rules to prevent the 
penalty from ever being applied. This crime bill is a sheep in wolf's clothing.
