<LEADPARA>  In a decision likely to speed executions of death row inmates, the Supreme
Court on Tuesday made it tougher for prisoners to make repeated federal
appeals of their convictions.;    The ruling was a victory for police and
prosecutors, but criminal defense lawyers charged that the decision
drastically curbed the rights of criminal defendants.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It will have the greatest impact on more than 2,400 prisoners living on
death row, where the average time between conviction and execution has been
eight years and four months.;    The 6-3 Supreme Court ruling was the latest
in a series of decisions by the court's conservative majority that, taken
together, have sharply limited the ability of state prisoners to obtain
federal reviews of their convictions and sentences.;    Those decisions dealt
with the scope of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the method by which
state prisoners, after exhausting their appeals in state courts, may claim in
federal courts that their convictions and sentences violated the U.S.
Constitution.;    The writ is considered a bulwark of U.S. liberties. Criminal
defense and civil liberties lawyers say the liberal use of the writ in the
past has uncovered a high proportion of serious errors.;    On Tuesday,
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court majority, noted that
successive petitions also delay justice, promote disrespect for the law and
waste court resources.;    The new criteria; Under a new rule announced by
Kennedy, a criminal defendant cannot raise a new claim in a second federal
appeal until proving that (1) there was a good reason -- such as a government
coverup of evidence -- for not doing so earlier, and (2) the omission
seriously hurt the defense.;    A defendant who cannot pass that test may be
heard only by showing a probability of innocence.;    The new rule, Kennedy
said, "should curtail the abusive petitions that in recent years have
threatened to undermine the integrity of the habeas corpus process." He was
backed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter.;    But Justice
Thurgood Marshall, joined by Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, accused
the court majority of abandoning precedent, creating "a near-irrebuttable
presumption that omitted claims are permanently barred" and encouraging
government "misconduct and deceit.";    Mary Broderick, a director of the
National Legal Aid and Defender Association declared: "It's just another notch
in the Supreme Court's effort to close the coffin on habeas corpus, another
example of the majority's willingness to ignore serious constitutional
errors.";    Inmate's second defeat;  The decision was a second high court
defeat for Georgia death row inmate Warren McCleskey, a black man convicted of
murdering a white off-duty police officer during a 1978 furniture store
robbery.;    In 1987, the justices rejected his attempt to prove racial
discrimination in death sentences. On Tuesday, in McCleskey vs. Zant, 89-7024,
they barred McCleskey from claiming in a second federal petition that a
confession used at his trial was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment
right to a lawyer.;    He had made such a claim in state appeals but not in
his first federal appeal. McCleskey argued that he had new evidence that had
been withheld by the state: a 21-page statement of the inmate who had heard
McCleskey's confession and reported it to state officials.;    But Kennedy
concluded that because McCleskey "knew everything in the document," its
unavailability did not prevent him from raising his Sixth Amendment claim in
his first federal petition.;     Tuesday's decision also may have dimmed
condemned murderer Robert Alton Harris' chances of getting a federal court to
overturn his California death sentence.;    Out of more than 300 prisoners on
death row in California, only Harris could be affected immediately, since he
is the only one whose case has progressed beyond a first round of federal
court challenges.;    Prosecutor's case bolstered;  A state prosecutor,
preparing for a crucial hearing in Harris' case, said Tuesday's ruling appears
to strengthen his argument that the defense had waited too long to raise
allegations of perjury by a cellmate of Harris.;    Harris was convicted of
the 1978 murders of two San Diego teen-agers whose car he wanted to use in a
bank robbery.;    After an unsuccessful appeal in state court and two rounds
of challenges in federal courts, he came within days of the state's first
execution since 1967 last April. But he was granted a stay in a new federal
appeal that raised two principal issues: ineffective assistance at trial by
psychiatrists, who allegedly failed to detect brain damage, and new evidence
that a cellmate who became a prosecution witness had committed perjury.;   
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered a hearing May 7 before a
federal judge in San Diego on the question of whether the cellmate, Joey
Abshire, was acting as a secret informant for police when he talked to Harris
about the killings and later testified about Harris' statements.;    Defense
lawyers have produced a recent statement from Abshire saying his questioning
of Harris was prompted by police, who had told him to deny their involvement.
That allegation could upset the capital murder convictions, but Tuesday's
ruling appeared to increase the possibility that the evidence will be thrown
out of court.;    Under the high court's standard, Harris "has to show that he
could not have raised that issue" in his two earlier federal challenges,
Deputy Attorney General Louis Hanoian said.; STANDARDS FOR DEATH-ROW APPEALS;
Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the Supreme Court majority, outlined new
criteria for allowing second federal appeals to prisoners.;    Prisoners can
appeal again only if:;    (box) They can prove that they had a good reason for
not presenting the claim in the first appeal, and;    (box) That the omission
seriously hurt their defense.; Or if:;     (box) They have evidence that will
show probable innocence.  </TEXT>
