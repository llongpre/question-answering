GOVERNOR ASSAILS U.S. DELAYS OF DEATH CASES

Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday assailed long delays in resolving capital 
cases and urged that federal judges curtail reviews of constitutional 
challenges to death sentences already upheld in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal courts should accept these petitions as seldom as is necessary," said 
Deukmejian, appearing at a hearing on behalf of the National Governors Assn. 
"If there has been a full and fair adjudication of the issues in state courts, 
they should accept that." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said that delay in reviewing appeals prevents capital punishment 
from serving as an effective deterrent to crime and enables criminals to "thumb 
their noses at the law," knowing that even if they are caught, they still can 
avoid paying the full price. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian testified before a special task force of judges and other legal 
authorities that is studying time-consuming delay, repetitive appeals, court 
congestion and other problems that critics say are plaguing federal 
constitutional challenges in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Such challenges are made in federal habeas corpus petitions that are filed 
after a defendant's conviction and sentence have been upheld in state courts. 
The petitions are restricted to claims of violation of federal constitutional 
rights, but the ability to file them has been substantially expanded by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. Currently, about 9,500 federal habeas 
corpus petitions are being filed annually in the United States, an estimated 5% 
of them in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member panel, sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and co-chaired by 
California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, is receiving testimony from 
prosecutors, defense attorneys and officials in a series of nationwide 
hearings. The panel began two days of proceedings here at a time when there is 
growing concern among judges, lawyers and other authorities over the prospect 
of long delays in the review of California capital cases in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court under Lucas has sharply accelerated its review of 
death-penalty cases, upholding 54 capital sentences in just two years. But the 
death verdicts upheld by the state court are being challenged further in what 
officials expect will be a wave of constitutional appeals in the federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and other witnesses cited as an example of their concern the case of 
Robert Alton Harris, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders 
of two youths in San Diego in 1978. His is the furthest along of any California 
capital case now in the federal court system and has been before federal judges 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' conviction and sentence were upheld in separate appeals by the state 
Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and, last July, by the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. But his subsequent petition for a rehearing before the 
federal appellate court is pending -- nearly a full year later. 
</P>
<P>
The governor urged the panelists to seek reforms in the process that would 
impose new time limits on federal habeas corpus appeals and require federal 
judges to defer to the factual findings made by state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. George M. Palmer told the panel there 
could be substantial additional delays when capital cases that have been in the 
state courts for years begin to flow into the federal courts. "When the bulk of 
the California cases hits the federal system, the road to final judgments will 
be long indeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, six habeas corpus petitions from condemned California inmates have 
been filed in federal courts. But the number is expected to increase 
considerably in coming months and a special committee of judges, lawyers and 
officials has been at work preparing new procedures to deal with the influx. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent rebuke to Deukmejian, San Francisco attorney Dennis P. Riordan, 
representing California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a group of defense 
lawyers, said that appeals to the federal courts would present little problem 
if state court judges would act to protect the rights of capital defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan noted that unlike federal judges, state judges do not enjoy lifetime 
tenure and warned that thus they are far more subject to election 
considerations and other political pressures that could influence their rulings 
in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the bitter 1986 California election that saw three high court 
members rejected by the voters, largely because of their reluctance to affirm 
death judgments, Riordan said: 
</P>
<P>
"A state judge who rules in favor of any capital defendant on any issue can be 
assured his ruling, no matter how clearly dictated by controlling 
constitutional precedent, will be publicly attacked by an opportunistic 
politician too dense to understand our system of constitutional rights or too 
cynical to care about its preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan observed that in the seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court 
reinstated capital punishment in 1976, federal appeal courts, reviewing cases 
mainly from the South, found constitutional violations in 73% of the state 
court death rulings they reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as more cases from the Western states are taken to federal courts, there 
is no less reason for careful review of death verdicts, he said.
