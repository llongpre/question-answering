   WASHINGTON -- The House passed an anti-crime bill that
would expand the federal death penalty and increase spending
for local law enforcement and state prisons.
   The package, approved 305-118, differs in several aspects
from legislation passed by the Senate in July. Lawmakers must
iron out those differences in a conference before sending a
bill to President Bush.

   The major point of contention at the conference probably
will be how much to curb state prisoners' rights to file
appeals in federal courts on constitutional grounds. The
House version would limit the availability of these so-called
habeas corpus petitions in many cases. The Senate version, in
contrast, would in effect eliminate these appeals, according
to Democratic lawmakers. President Bush favors the more
stringent approach.
   Last year, both houses passed anti-crime bills, but
conferees were unable to work out compromises; the final
package was stripped of its most controversial provisions,
including those limiting habeas corpus petitions.
   Compromise is somewhat more likely this year. For one
thing, the House passed death-penalty provisions similar to
those approved in the Senate. Both versions would expand the
federal death penalty to cover 50 additional crimes,
including murder of high government officials, espionage and
certain drug crimes. The House, as the Senate did earlier,
struck from its bill language that would have allowed a
defendant to avoid execution if he could prove that capital
punishment had been applied in a racially disproportionate
fashion in that jurisdiction.
   The passage of the death-penalty provisions, stripped of a
"racial justice" defense, is a major victory for President
Bush, who has made capital punishment a centerpiece of his
anti-crime program. Eager to appear just as "tough" as
Republicans, most Democrats supported the death-penalty
provisions.
   Both houses also have passed variations of a weeklong
mandatory waiting period for handgun purchases. Mr. Bush has
said he will sign such a gun-control provision only if
Congress presents him with death-penalty and habeas corpus
measures to his liking. The Senate passed a ban on nine types
of semi-automatic "assault" weapons; the House rejected a
similar provision.
   The House bill includes a broader exception to the
so-called exclusionary rule, under which judges prevent
illegally gathered evidence from being admitted in court. The
Senate version would allow admission of such evidence when
police made a "good faith" mistake but did seek a search
warrant. The House version would apply even when police
didn't get a warrant.
