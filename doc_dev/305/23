<LEADPARA>  The Senate today approved President Bush's plan to severely limit legal
maneuvers by death row inmates seeking to delay their executions.;    The
White House proposal, passed 58-40, would block so-called habeas corpus
petitions in federal court unless the judge found that state courts treated
the defendant unfairly, and those petitions would have to be filed within six
months.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BACKING BUSH, SENATE LIMITS DEATH ROW APPEALS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Democrats had proposed a time limit, but without such strict standards for
the initial appeal. After the first petition, subsequent efforts would be
barred unless new facts came to light or if the Supreme Court changed the
law.;    Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., argued the Bush plan would "rid us of
abuse" but "at the very high price of endangering our constitutional rights.";
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the Democratic proposal had too many
loopholes. "There is no reason why the federal courts must hear every claim,
in every case at every time," he said.;    The plan to limit death row appeals
was approved a day after the Senate voted to expand the federal death penalty
to dozens of additional crimes.;    The amendment are part of an overall crime
bill touching on many controversial subjects.;    Senate leaders planned to
finish the bill this week but that was put in doubt Tuesday when Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., an amendment to ban all job preference based on race, national
origin or similar factors -- an issue other lawmakers didn't want to tack on
the crime bill.;    By votes of 73-25 and 68-30 Tuesday, senators affirmed
their support for expanding the federal death penalty to 49 more crimes,
including everything from assassination of the president to the slaying of a
federal poultry inspector.;    Additional crimes might be added before the
Senate finishes the bill. Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, has proposed the death
penalty for drug-related killings in the District of Columbia.;    But before
voting on more capital punishment provisions, the Senate planned to deal with
its frustration that in some cases, by filing multiple petitions, people
sentenced to death have managed to avoid execution for years.;    "Americans
cannot understand why it takes so many years . . . why it takes so much of the
energy of our legal system . . . to have the consequences of truth and justice
executed," said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.;    Graham was sponsoring an amendment
that would put a six-month time limit on the filing of a habeas corpus
petition. After the first, additional attempts would be allowed only if they
went directly to the question of guilt or innocence or, under limited
conditions, to the appropriateness of the death penalty.;    Graham also would
require states to provide qualified lawyers to handle such appeals for
indigent inmates.;    Republicans said the Democrats' plan would attract a
veto by the president because it was not restrictive enough. And providing
lawyers would result in more petitions than currently clog the courts, they
said.;    Democrats contend Bush's version would virtually eliminate habeas
corpus, seriously hurting justice in the interest of expediency.  </TEXT>
