   The House is nearing approval of an anticrime
bill that would expand the use of the death penalty, but it first
must choose between two plans designed to shorten delays in
carrying out executions.
   ``We who are the lawmakers believe that when the death penalty
is meted out, it should be done fairly but it should be done
expeditiously,'' Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., said Wednesday as
debate got under way.
   Conservatives clamoring for tougher death penalty provisions
were blamed by the chief sponsor, Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., for
turning the bill into a ``political football'' a month before
congressional elections.
   Under the bill, federal courts could impose the death penalty
for assassination of a range of government officials. The offenses
of treason and espionage also would be punishable by death.
   The bill also seeks to limit the number of habeas corpus
petitions inmates under death sentence could file and thus postpone
execution, by a decade or more in some case. Such petitions
challenge whether a prisoner is being held legally.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   If approved, the bill would go to a conference committee for
resolution of differences with a Senate-passed version.
   President Bush has criticized the House bill, saying some
features are less stringent that current law. He has been critical
of provisions that would allow death row inmates to use racial
statistics to bolster their appeals.
   Bush also has attacked the habeas corpus provision, saying that
far from speeding up the appeals process, it would stretch it to
greater length.
   Conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., are pushing for
a tightened version and last week succeeded in blocking floor
action until Democrats agreed to a vote on their plan.
   The bill would require those under death sentence to file their
habeas corpus petitions within a year after exhausting their direct
appeals. It would limit them to one petition but provide for a
number of exceptions. Hyde wants to substitute a provision that
would allow state to impose the limits as long as the defendants
were represented by competent lawyers.
   Republicans also have forced sponsors to allow a vote on an
amendment sponsored by Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio, that would
permit confiscation of the homes of those convicted of savings and
loan fraud. ``I'm tired of the lavish lifestyles of the S&amp;L
crooks,'' Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., declared.
   Hughes pleaded with Republicans not to try to pepper the bill
with unconstitutional amendments. He said a tough bill was needed,
but also ``a bill we can all be proud of, a bill we can all go home
and campaign on.''
   GOP lawmakers, however, made it clear they wanted a substantial
reshaping of the legislation.
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., denounced ``endless appeals and
twisting the rules to prevent the will of the people from being
carried out.''
   ``In its present form, it would not help law enforcement, it
would hinder law enforcement,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.
   ``Some of my Republican colleagues want to play political
football with this issue,'' Hughes finally said. `` ... But the
Republican colleagues in my opinion are wrong in their belief that
the American public will award the moral high ground to whoever
claims to be the most bloodthirsty.''
