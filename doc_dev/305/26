   When screenwriter Barry Morrow first met
Kim, his original model for the central character in ``Rain Man,''
Kim already knew Morrow's past and present phone numbers and the
number of freeway exits to his house.
   They met in Texas where Kim and his father, Fran, were attending
a 1984 meeting of the American Association of Retarded Citizens.
Kim, 37, is an extremely rare prodigious savant, capable of
recalling virtually anything his senses have ever told him.
   But while Kim has a seemingly unlimited ability to absorb and
recall facts and figures, he has limited reasoning power and his IQ
is a below-average 88. He always has lived with Fran in the Salt
Lake City area, accompanying him on frequent business trips since a
1981 divorce from Kim's mother.
   ``I am Rain Man,'' Kim said in an interview. ``This is an
important time for me. I have many talents now.''
   Morrow, who calls Kim ``an island of genius,'' believes the movie
has changed Kim.
   ``When I first met him, after he talked to me he dashed across
the room and made low moaning sounds,'' Morrow said. ``Now, he would
walk into a room and offer you his hand.''
   Kim's father, who asked for privacy reasons that his and Kim's
last name not be used, agrees that his son is changing. After a
special screening of ``Rain Man'' for the Utah Legislature, Kim
stood up and stressed the importance of understanding the needs of
the handicapped.
   ``I had no idea he could talk to those guys that way,'' Fran
said. ``He is really learning to put his thoughts together.''
   After meeting father and son, Morrow decided he would pair a
savant like Kim _ trusting and sometimes childlike _ with a greedy,
self-centered and impatient brother.
   ``Then I put them in a car and had them drive across the country
together,'' said Morrow, nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay.
It chronicles the relationship between Raymond Babbit, an autistic
savant played by Dustin Hoffman, and his brother, Charlie, played by
Tom Cruise.
   ``I don't want to take away from the other people that helped
Dustin create the character,'' Morrow said by telephone from
Claremont, Calif., ``but Kim was the first inspiration for the
story.''
   Coincidentally, Fran and Kim were rolling down the freeway when
they heard the news last week that ``Rain Man'' had been nominated
for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor.
   Kim has seen the movie three times, the first seated at the
premier between Morrow and Fran. Kim stared at his hands and the
floor during most of the movie. When Morrow asked him why, Kim told
him he had seen it with his ``heart.''
   While there are behavioral similarities between Kim and Hoffman's
film character, Kim is far more outgoing. Two years ago he spent an
afternoon with Hoffman on a movie set, the actor mimicking his
movements and his walk.
   When it was over, Kim recalls, Hoffman said, ``I may be the star,
but you are the heavens.''
   Daniel Christensen, medical director of the Western Institute of
Neuropsychiatry at the University of Utah, has made a thorough study
of Kim.
   ``He has a photographic memory, but no way to minimize stimuli,''
Christensen said. ``He's the closest I've seen to a human
computer,'' unable to filter or forget information, or assign it
relative importance.
   He can answer untold thousands of questions covering history,
sports, maps, literature, mathematics and other subjects.
   ``You'd expect someone with these mental skills to have something
extra in his brain, but there's actually something missing,''
Christensen said. Brain scans show an absence of the bundle of nerve
fibers _ the corpus callosum _ that connects the two halves of the
brain.
   ``Kim is probably one in 10 million,'' he said.
   Morrow offers another insight. ``Kim has been called a savant
with some autistic characteristics, but the real answer is that,
like all of us, Kim defies human labels.''
   The screenwriter said Hoffman has received a flood of mail from
people touched by the movie, people who know other Rain Men. Morrow
takes little credit for the response.
   ``That was an accident,'' he said. ``The bigger story, bigger
than the movie, is that people are coming out of their prisons and
growing. The awards will go away, but the people like Kim will not.''
