<LEADPARA>  The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear an appeal from a Virginia death row
prisoner, despite objections from three justices who said he may be innocent.;
  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who usually sides with law enforcement in
criminal cases, joined two liberal justices in unsuccessfully urging federal
court review of the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell. He faces the electric chair
for the rape and murder of a Virginia Beach secretary in 1985.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Because of the gross injustice that would result if an innocent man were
sentenced to death, O'Dell's substantial federal claims can, and should,
receive careful consideration from the federal court with . . . jurisdiction
over the case," wrote Justice Harry Blackmun, who was joined by Justices John
Paul Stevens and O'Connor.;   One vote too few;   The appeal fell a vote short
of the four required for a Supreme Court hearing. The majority did not explain
why the petition was spurned.;   Their denial was representative of the
conservative court's continuing efforts to limit federal habeas corpus, a
complex and controversial legal procedure that enables inmates to go to the
federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of their state convictions
and sentences.;   Supporters of strictly limited habeas corpus rights argue
that death row inmates have used repeated appeals to delay their executions
for an average of eight years. Backers of less limited rights cite statistics
showing that federal judges have found serious constitutional errors requiring
reversal of nearly 40 percent of death penalty cases brought before them.;  
Unable to get to court;   So far, O'Dell, 49, of Roanoke, Va., who
consistently has asserted his innocence, has been unable to get into federal
court.;   His lawyer says that, contrary to other tests produced at O'Dell's
trial, DNA tests prove that blood found on his clothing -- a key piece of
evidence against him -- cannot be linked to the blood of the murder victim.
O'Dell claims that his clothing was bloodied in an unrelated barroom brawl.;  
O'Dell argues that he should not have been allowed to represent himself and
that he should have been allowed to try to prove that a fellow inmate, who
testified that O'Dell had confessed in prison, had offered to manufacture
evidence in other trials to avoid imprisonment.;   O'Dell made headlines last
summer when he asked that his sperm be frozen and used to inseminate his
girlfriend.  </TEXT>
