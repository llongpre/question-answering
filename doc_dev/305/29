   Nancy Clark rode her sailboard over
the northern edge of Hurricane Gilbert on Friday to the cheers of a
surfside crowd that gathered after word their city would be spared
the brunt of the hurricane.
   Much of Corpus Christi seemed abandoned Friday, but Ocean Drive
was jammed with traffic as residents and tourists flocked to the
city's seawall with the news that Gilbert would hit farther south
than expected.
   The eye of the hurricane came ashore Friday afternoon about 120
miles south of Brownsville, or about 280 miles from Corpus Christi.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road in
Corpus Christi, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined
by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their
boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Ms. Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds after
fleeing Port Isabel near Brownsville.
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen surfers who rode high tides
at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay in Corpus
Christi had heard repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn
toward the north, striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus
Christi with heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''
