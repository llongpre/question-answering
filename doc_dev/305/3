   High school students pose the
greatest menace at spring break time, said officials reeling from a
wild weekend that included a riot, four stabbings and the deaths of
two youths whose car plunged off a dock.
   ``That's our worst time, when the San Antonio high school
students are here,'' City Manager Gordon Beck said Sunday.
   Beaches were again packed with partying teen-agers early today.
An estimated 30,000 students were staying in this resort island
town near Corpus Christi, said Coast Guard spokesman Anthony E.
Lloyd.
   ``I think things are back to normal for a spring break, which is
in no way normal,'' Beck said.
   Authorities said mainly high school students appeared to be
involved in early Sunday's three-hour disturbance by 3,000 youths,
authorities said.
   ``What you have down there is a tremendous amount of
intoxication going on. All it takes sometimes is for someone to
bump into someone else. The crowd just turned into a riot,'' said
Officer Jim Kaelin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   The disturbance began when a motorist struck a 16-year-old girl
on the beach and then attempted to leave, said Police Chief Don
Perkins. Angry youths began to attack the driver, but he was pulled
away by police.
   The youths then tipped over the man's car and torched it,
Perkins said.
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a University of Texas
student.
   More than 100 officers aided by tear gas and hovering Coast
Guard helicopters with searchlights worked to restore order.
   The accident victim was treated for minor injuries. The driver,
John Montanes, 26, of San Antonio, was charged with failure to stop
and render aid and was in jail Sunday night in lieu of $500 bond.
   Two police officers were injured and eight people, including one
accused of inciting a riot, were arrested as a result of the melee,
police said.
   Authorities reported at least four people were stabbed in
unrelated attacks and a car containing the bodies of two young men
was found in Corpus Christi Bay. About a mile from the riot site,
the car crashed through a barrier hours after the disturbance and
sank in water 20 to 25 feet deep, said Coast Guard spokesman
Anthony E. Lloyd in Corpus Christi.
   The victims' identities were not released.
   Perkins said all eight of his officers were on duty late Sunday.
   ``You never expect a riot,'' Perkins said. ``You don't want it
to occur, and with the cooperation of the students it won't occur.
However, last night we got no cooperation.''
   He said his officers felt seriously threatened at one point
during the melee.
   ``When bottles and cans are being thrown at you, you get to
feeling endangered,'' Perkins said.
   While most of the injured were treated and released Sunday, a
17-year-old stabbing victim remained hospitalized in satisfactory
condition today at AMI Coastal Bend hospital.
