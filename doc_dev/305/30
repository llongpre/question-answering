   MCorp will sell its interest in MBank Corpus
Christi to the bank's managers, company officials said Friday. It
would be the second such transaction in less than two weeks.
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory and bankruptcy court
approvals, would leave MCorp, once the state's second-largest bank
holding company, with three subsidiaries to sell.
   A group of investors led by Jerry Gates, chairman and chief
executive officer of MBank Corpus Christi, will become the bank's
owner under an agreement with MCorp. The sale is expected to be
complete by July 31.
   The bank had assets of $582 million and deposits of $502 million
on Dec. 31, 1989.
   The bank's name will be changed to Corpus Christi National Bank,
the name under which it was originally chartered 100 years ago.
   ``Over the past few months, as events unfolded which made it
appear that local ownership of the bank was a possibility, we've
received hundreds of comments from customers and community leaders
expressing their support for the return of Corpus Christi National
Bank,'' Gates said.
   Terms of the agreement call for MCorp to receive an undisclosed
amount of assets, mostly loans and real estate, for the bank's
stock. MBank Corpus Christi will simultaneously issue $20 million
in new stock.
   MCorp, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since March
1989, last week said it had reached an agreement to sell MBank El
Paso to its managers.
   The Dallas-based firm is trying to sell its remaining banking
subsidiaries in Brownsville, New Braunfels and Waco.
   ``We are looking to sell those assuming we can get what we view
as adequate or proper value for the benefit of our shareholders,''
said MCorp spokesman Doug Hughes.
   The five banks remained with MCorp after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. stripped it of 20 banking subsidiaries following
the bankruptcy filing. Those 20 banks were bought by Banc One
Corp., an Ohio banking company, and now operate as Bank One-Texas.
   MCorp's federally assisted bailout was the third largest in
history after those of Continental Illinois in 1984 and First
Republic Corp. of Dallas in 1988.
