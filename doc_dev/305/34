   A disturbance erupted late Saturday
among more than 1,000 students on spring break, leaving four people
with stab wounds and two police officers with injuries, authorities
said. A car was missing after going off a ferry dock into the water.
   ``It's an all-out riot,'' said Anthony Lloyd, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Port Aransas. ``They are setting cars on fire. People
are hurt on the beach.''
   The disturbance began when a motorist hit a girl on the beach at
this popular Gulf Coast vacation spot and tried to leave the scene,
said Corpus Christi Department of Public Safety officer A.G.
Michniak.
   ``There was a hit-and-run accident on the beach that injured
one,'' Michniak said. ``The crowd stopped the car, took out the
occupants and tipped it over and burned it.''
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a student at the
University of Texas.
   At least eight people were arrested, Michniak said.
   Coast Guard divers Sunday morning battled a strong rip current
to search for the missing car.
   A ferry captain and deck hand watched the car ``drive through a
barrier and into the water because there was no ferry to catch the
car. They witnessed the car going down and we were called out. We
have no idea how many were in the car,'' said Coast Guard spokesman
Steven E. Sander
   The car broke in half a barrier similar to those at railroad
crossings and equipped with red flashing lights, he said.
   ``Most likely, whatever was in the car is still in the car,'' he
said.
   The car was in water about 18 feet deep. Coast Guard vessels
dragged the water, and divers hunted for the vehicle.
   ``We feel it is related to the spring breakers,'' Sander said.
``It happens every year. Just drunk college kids not thinking.''
   More than 100 law enforcement officers from south Texas and the
Coast Guard, using two helicopters and tear gas, responded to the
disturbance on the beach, the Corpus Christi Caller Times reported.
   Michniak estimated the crowd on the beach at about 3,000, while
Lloyd put it at about 1,000. Lloyd said most of the students
appeared to be high-school age.
   Law enforcement officials in Port Aransas said ambulances were
unable to get through the crowd to assist the injured.
   ``There are injuries, but we're unable to pull them out,'' said
a Port Aransas police dispatcher, who did not wish to be identified.
   Paul Guerra of Port Aransas said he witnessed a stabbing as he
left the beach.
   ``I walked by a group on a roadway. All of a sudden, somebody
yelled and a guy fell. He had blood all over his chest,'' Guerra
said. ``I heard them shout, He's stabbed! He's stabbed!' They
started tearing at his clothes, and then the police came running
over.
   ``I left,'' Guerra said. ``I hate to say it, but I was afraid
for my life.''
   Helicopters from the Coast Guard and the DPS swept the area with
searchlights.
   Michniak said the DPS received the first call at 11:35 p.m. and
declared the disturbance under control at 2:40 a.m. Sunday.
   About 30,000 students were staying in this island resort for
spring break, Lloyd said.
