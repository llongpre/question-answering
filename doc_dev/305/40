   Democratic leaders are trying to revive a
major crime bill that conservatives derailed in a protest over
death penalty provisions they said are too weak.
   ``This is a travesty,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
said Tuesday as he and other conservatives fought the measure on
the House floor. They said it needed stricter provisions to end
excessive delays in carrying out death sentences.
   The conservatives, who usually lack enough support to win such
fights in Democratic-controlled House, managed to defeat, 258-166,
a rule that would have barred the House from considering a tighter
version of the death penalty provision.
   The vote forced Democratic leaders to pull the bill from the
floor after only brief debate and search for a new procedure that
would withstand any such attack.
   It was a bad day on the anti-crime issue for House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash. He also came under fire from police lobbying
groups over a separate provision barring consideration of an
amendment to increase controls on handguns.
   The overall anti-crime package calls for the death penalty for
10 federal crimes, ranging from assassination of the president to
espionage. It would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed search warrants if police had acted ``in good faith.''
   A major controversy is brewing over ``habeas corpus'' provisions
designed to end delays of a decade or more in carrying out
executions while the condemned file repeated appeals claiming they
were treated in an unconstitutional manner.
   The bill is designed to limit death row inmates to one such
petition in many cases to be filed no later than one year after
their other appeals are exhausted. The Bush administration and
conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., say however that
it needs to be far stronger.
   As it stands, the bill would ``reduce the degree of finality of
convictions by weakening procedures relating to habeas corpus,''
the administration said in a statement Tuesday.
   The administration also called for approval of warrantless
searches if police acted in good faith and it attacked a provision
of the House bill that would enable convicts to use racial
statistics as a basis for appealing death sentences.
   Defenders of the bill said it could be improved but that it did
provide not only powerful weapons for police in the war against
crime but ones that could win approval on Capitol Hill.
   ``It puts more arrows in the quiver of law enforcement,'' said
Rep. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky. But there were many Democratic
defectors.
   Meanwhile, police groups said at a news conference that controls
on semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police
are to be effective in fighting crime.
   ``Should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers and
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of Congress before we
pass sensible gun legislation?'' asked Fraternal Order of Police
leader Dewey Stokes.
   The police groups criticized a Rules Committee decision Monday
barring consideration of an amendment that would require a
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   ``Right now, Speaker Foley is not permitting the (amendment) to
come to a vote on the floor of the House, so who else can we
blame?'' Stokes said.
   Foley's spokesman, Jeff Biggs, noted the House Judiciary
Committee had approved the anti-crime package and the handgun bill
as separate measures and said the speaker often goes along with the
wishes of committee chairmen. He also said that Foley had not ruled
out consideration of the gun bill as a separate item.
