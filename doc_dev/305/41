   The Supreme Court today sidestepped deciding
whether a criminal defendant's right to be tried by his peers is
violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their
race.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague,
sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago
supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot
after the robbery.
   Four justices _ one vote short of the majority needed to set
binding legal precedent _ said Teague should not be allowed to raise
the representative-jury issue.
   The four, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said federal courts
should not establish new constitutional guidelines when ruling on
so-called habeas corpus appeals by criminal defendants.
   Such appeals attack a defendant's state court conviction or
sentence on grounds that federal constitutional rights were
violated. The appeals always follow unsuccessful state court appeals
by the defendants.
   The justices in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may disqualify
potential jurors based on their race. The court said such tactics
violate equal-protection rights.
   But a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive effect
of the 1986 ruling. The court said previously that the 1986 ruling
does not apply to convicted criminals who, like Teague, had
exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to when the 1986
ruling was announced.
   Teague's habeas corpus appeal did not raise the equal-protection
issue, but instead attacked a prosecutor's exclusion of 10 potential
black jurors on grounds that it violated Teague's right to a jury
selected from a cross-section of the community.
   Teague, who is black, was convicted in 1978 by an all-white jury.
   If Teague were to win on the fair cross-section challenge, he
would be entitled to a new trial even though the high court's 1986
ruling came too late to help him.
   Past Supreme Court rulings have applied the Sixth Amendment's
fair cross-section requirement to pools of potential jurors but not
to juries actually selected.
   O'Connor said the court should not decide whether the fair
cross-section requirement applies to selected juries as well because
that ruling could not apply to Teague.
   Her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens
also voted to uphold Teague's conviction but for differing reasons.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The case is Teague vs. Lane, 87-5259.
