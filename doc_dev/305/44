   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court upheld Labor Department
regulations that make it tougher for several thousand coal
miners or their families to be eligible for black-lung
disability benefits.
   The 7-1 decision, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, will
make it easier for coal companies to defend themselves
against as many as 3,500 miners' disability claims, valued at
as much as $650 million.

   The ruling resolved a dispute over claims filed between
1973 and 1980 by workers who said they were disabled by lung
disease resulting from prolonged exposure to coal dust, or by
the families of workers who died after such exposure. These
disability claims, to be paid by coal companies, are reviewed
by the Labor Department.
   The legal issue was whether coal companies may avoid
paying disability claims only by proving that miners were or
are still capable of doing their mine work, or whether
companies may present other evidence, such as medical
problems that aren't mine-related.
   The federal appeals courts were divided over how many
defenses Congress allowed to the coal companies. The high
court yesterday deferred to the Labor Department's assertion
that Congress meant for the coal companies to have some
flexibility in fending off black-lung claims, which are
generally easier to prove than more-traditional disability
claims.
   The court ruled in two separate appeals. In one, the high
court affirmed the ruling of a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia, and in the other, it reversed the ruling of a
federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. Justice Antonin Scalia
dissented, saying the Labor Department regulations weren't a
plausible interpretation of federal benefits law. Justice
Anthony Kennedy didn't vote in the case.
   The companies involved in the high court decision were:
BethEnergy Mines Inc., a Bethlehem Steel Corp. unit;
Clinchfield Coal Co., a unit of Pittston Cos.; and
Consolidation Coal Co., a Du Pont Co. unit. (Pauley vs.
BethEnergy Mines Inc.; Clinchfield Coal Co. vs. Director,
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs; Consolidation Coal
Co. vs. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs)
                                                                                                       

   Nuclear Plants
                                                                                                       

   The justices left intact a Maine state court ruling that
federal, not state, law governs the cost and process of
decommissioning a nuclear power plant to take it out of
service.
   The Maine Supreme Court ruled in October 1990 that federal
law pre-empts a 1982 state law regulating the conditions for
decommissioning nuclear plants when their licenses have
expired. Federal law gives federal agencies authority to be
certain that nuclear plants have reserve funds to pay for
taking plants out of active service when their licenses
expire and that their nuclear material must be removed.
   The Maine Public Utilities Commission objected to a plan
submitted by Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission for charging customers the
estimated future costs of decommissioning the Maine Yankee.
The Maine Yankee plan, approved by the FERC, calls for a
reserve fund of $167 million, in annual payments of
$9,070,000. The state regulators said the fund should be $178
million, in annual payments of $9,790,000.
   But the state supreme court ruled that the Maine
regulators couldn't interfere with the funds set by federal
officials. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by state regulators.
   Other utilities, including Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire and New England Power Co., own Maine Yankee. (Maine

Co.)
                                                                                                       

   Criminal Appeals
                                                                                                       

   The high court further curtailed the ability of people
convicted of murder or other crimes in state court to
challenge the constitutionality of their convictions in
federal court.
   The case involved habeas corpus, a civil lawsuit most
often filed by a convict whose appeals have been rejected. A
habeas corpus petition typically argues that the inmate's
rights were violated during the arrest or trial. The Supreme
Court in the past few years has expressed concern at abuse of
the system by inmates who file one habeas petition after
another, and the justices have tried to limit the number of
such petitions and time in which they can be filed.
   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the high
court, by a 6-3 vote, erected new procedural obstacles to
federal courts' consideration of inmates' first habeas
petitions. The decision makes it tougher for inmates who
violate state court habeas procedures to then file in federal
court.
   The decision appeared to overrule finally a 1963 ruling
that markedly opened up federal court review of state
criminal convictions. The 1963 ruling has been eroded by the
high court in the past 15 years, but never overruled.
   Justice Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices Thurgood
Marshall and John Stevens. (Coleman vs. Thompson)
