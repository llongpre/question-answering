   President Bush on Tuesday said a
Democratic anti-crime bill is ``a sheep in wolf's clothing'' and
promised he will recommend record spending on drug education and
treatment.
   After a tour of a once drug infested street, Bush said that an
anti-crime bill pending in the Senate under the sponsorship of Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., is merely a ``Trojan Horse.''
   ``It looks like a real crime bill. Sounds like a real crime
bill. But in actuality it will be tougher on law enforcement than
on criminals,'' he told a gathering of Kansas City law enforecment
officials. ``America needs a crime bill with teeth, but this is a
sheep in wolf's clothing.''
   Biden said in Washington that the primary difference between the
versions of the bill is over how much resources should be committed.
   ``The president called my proposal `a Trojan horse standing at
the gates of Congress,''' Biden said in a release. ``Well, the
Trojan horse was filled with soldiers who won their war, and my
crime bill is loaded with money for more police and drug agents _
soldiers we need to fight the war on crime today.''
   The White House contends Biden's bill falls short as it pertains
to exclusionary rules of evidence, habeas corpus and the death
penalty.
   Biden's provisions in those areas, Bush said, ``will only
entrench and extend the legal loopholes and red tape that disrupt
law enforcement and have angered the American people for far too
long.''
   Bush toured a street where three so-called crack houses were
boarded up, and visited with residents who had helpled organize the
neighborhood against crime.
   Several members from a committee called Black Men Together
demonstrated for the president how they discourage drug users by
chanting: ``Hey Pusher, hey you. Black men out here are watching
you,'' and ``You better run dope pusher, better run.''
   Bush will announce the second phase of his national anti-drug
strategy Thursday in a speech to newspaper publishers, said White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Our national drug strategy calls for record levels of new
funding for both education and treatment,'' Bush said, referring to
the plan his drug policy coordinator William Bennett put forward
Sept. 5.
   The administration has not given any specific figures for the
second phase.
   Fitzwater also said Bush still intends to go to the Feb. 15 drug
summit in Cartagena, Colombia, despite a news report tht druglords
are procuring anti-aircraft missiles in a plan to shoot down Air
Force One.
   ``The Secret Service assures us they can provide security,''
Fitzwater told reporters flying with the president Tuesday.
   Bush professed as he flew to Kanas City to be holding out a hand
of cooperation to Congress on its return Tuesday from a two-month
recess.
   ``We're renewing the spirit of cooperation,'' he said.
   But he later noted one of points festering between the White
House and Capitol Hill.
   He said Congress ``deserves our thanks for providing the new
federal troops we asked for _ new agents, new prosecutors, and new
prisons to catch, convict and contain those who prey on our
cities.''
   ``But it's time for Congress to finish the job. Because it does
no good to send the troops into battle wearing handcuffs,'' he told
the law enforcement audience.
   Bennett is developing the second stage of an anti-drug plan,
which features money for eradication and interdiction in the South
American drug production countries, as well as more money for
prisons, education and treatment programs and federal assistance
for state and community crime-fighting efforts.
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Congress for enacting only part
of his anti-crime plan. In November, lawmakers voted $4.2 billion
to expand federal prison capacity, hire more prosecutors and
federal agents and take other measures in the war on crime.
   That was $500 million more than Bush had asked for, according to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   But Bush also is urging passage of tougher sentencing for
hardened criminals, restrictions on plea bargaining and the death
penalty for drug dealers who kill police.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration
considers Biden's bill too weak because it:
   _Contains ``too many exceptions'' on the death penalty.
   _Does not incorporate Bush's request for exclusionary laws to
permit officers a ``good faith'' exception in evidence gathering if
it is later found the search violated constitutional protections.
   _Does not follow Bush's proposal for ``habeas corpus reforms to
stop the frivolous appeals that are choking the courts.''
   _Lacks the elements for coordination and cooperation between law
enforcement agencies that Bush is pushing.
   A Judiciary Committee aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Biden's legislation is similar to Bush's but bans ``racially
discriminatory executions'' and allows good-faith exceptions to the
exclusionary rule only if the illegal search was conducted with a
warrant.
   Biden's bill would also ban the assembly, sale or transfer of
assault weapons. Bush has banned import of semiautomatic assault
weapons.
   Biden's bill would nearly double the amount of federal aid for
local law enforcement recommended by Bush, from $350 million to
$600 million, and add 1,000 FBI agents, 350 drug enforcement agents
and 300 prosecutors.
