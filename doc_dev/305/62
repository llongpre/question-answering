<LEADPARA>  The White House today threatened a veto of crime legislation drafted by
House-Senate negotiators, charging that Democrats "gutted the bill" of
provisions sought by President Bush.;   Bush "expects to veto it" if the crime
package comes to his desk as drafted Sunday night by House-Senate negotiators
over the vehement objections of Republicans, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Democrats who controlled the House-Senate conference turned up the
political heat on Bush by crafting a crime package that expands the federal
death penalty and regulates handgun sales but weakens key provisions sought by
the president.;   "They basically gutted the bill in all of its meaningful
provisions," Fitzwater said as the White House sought to cast Democrats in
Congress as soft on crime.;   Senate Republicans vowed to fight the crime
bill, threatening a filibuster as several other major measures await final
drafting and floor action.;   The $3.1 billion anti-crime package, approved by
Democratic-led House and Senate negotiators, would apply the death penalty to
about 50 federal crimes and impose a five-day waiting period for handgun
purchases.;   House Democrats said they hoped to bring the bill up for a vote
today.;   But Senate Democrats faced a tough battle from Republicans over less
sweeping provisions limiting appeals by convicts and allowing court use of
some illegally obtained evidence. "I think every avenue will be taken to stop
this bill in the Senate," said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who led the GOP
opposition in the conference.;   Both houses hope to adjourn for the year on
Tuesday or Wednesday after completing action on the crime package, a $151
billion highway program, more bailout money for failed banks and savings and
loans, extended unemployment benefits and a general emergency appropriation
bill.;   On the banking bill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
predicted that a conference committee beginning work on the measure today
would not agree to a Senate-passed provision capping interest on credit cards
but "perhaps to some interim measure." He did not elaborate.;   Habeas corpus
changes; Besides an expanded federal death penalty, Bush has sought to sharply
restrict the ability of state prisoners to file habeas corpus petitions in
federal court to appeal their convictions. He also sought to give police wider
latitude to seize evidence.;   The negotiators chose a tough but
less-restrictive habeas corpus provision that was passed last month by the
House rather than the Senate measure supported by the administration.;  
Negotiators also opted for the Senate's narrower exception to the so-called
exclusionary rule, which bars the use of illegally obtained evidence. Bush had
supported a broader exception passed by the House that would apply to searches
without warrants.;   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said "the president has to veto
this" because the bill set up a mechanism for "frivolous appeals" by inmates
on death row to delay their executions.;   "The administration will not accept
a bill that guts the tough provisions passed by the House and the Senate,"
Paul J. McNulty, a Justice Department spokesman, said Sunday night.;   But
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said: "I'll bet money that if this bill
reaches the president's desk he will sign it. He doesn't want to veto a tough
crime bill.";   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said "the president would be happy if we didn't get
anything . . . so he could have a political victory.";   Thurmond led a
Republican effort to stall action in the conference, accusing Democrats of
trying to "ram this bill through regardless.";   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,
said "the president of the United States will beat up all the Democrats on
this issue.";   House negotiators refused to accept a Senate-passed ban on 14
semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The House had rejected a similar
provision when it passed its crime bill last month.;   Money for drug therapy;
  The anti-crime package would also give states money to improve drug
treatment for prisoners and put more police on street patrols.;   It would set
up 10 regional drug prisons and designate drug emergency areas that would
qualify for more law enforcement assistance. The bill also stiffens penalties
for drug trafficking and crimes involving guns.;   Republicans suffered
another setback during an unusual Saturday session as Democrats brushed aside
a call for a vote on a GOP economic stimulus package that includes a tax cut
on capital gains and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts.;   Mitchell said
Sunday that Congress would not stay in session and act on an economic plan
because Bush does not plan to propose his own package until his State of the
Union address in late January or early February.;   "Without presidential
participation and presidential involvement and presidential activity, there
isn't any plan or program going to become law," Mitchell said on NBC-TV's
"Meet the Press."; CONGRESSIONAL CRIME-FIGHTING; Here are the major provisions
of the anti-crime package approved Sunday night by House and Senate
negotiators. The bill, which blends differing features of measures passed by
the House and Senate, now goes back to both chambers for more action.;   DEATH
PENALTY: The death penalty would be newly imposed for 50 federal crimes,
including murder of federal officials, espionage, treason and terrorist acts
resulting in death. Drug kingpins who operate large-scale operations that sell
massive amounts of illegal drugs could also be executed.;   GUN CONTROL: A
five-day waiting period would be required for handgun purchases to allow for a
criminal record check.;   CRIMINAL APPEALS: State prisoners' appeals in
federal court would be restricted.;   POLICE SEARCHES: Improperly seized
evidence could be introduced in federal court cases if police acted in good
faith while executing a search warrant.;   DRUG TREATMENT: Money would be
earmarked for states to provide drug treatment for prisoners, and drug testing
and treatment of federal inmates would be required.;   TOUGHER PENALTIES: The
bill would triple the penalty for drug crimes that involve minors and dictate
tougher penalties for selling drugs in public housing and truck stops.;
