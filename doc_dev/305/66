   Residents of this quiet town, where
``everybody knows everybody,'' were stunned and scared after a
young woman said a group of men raped her repeatedly while
onlookers ignored her pleas.
   ``It's something horrible,'' said Jesse Castanon, owner of the
J.C. Windmill Restaurant on State Highway 44, the main road through
this South Texas county seat about 70 miles west of Corpus Christi.
   ``I don't know how to explain it to you because all of the
people are shocked because this never happened here,'' Castanon
said. He said he knew most of the 11 men arrested in the case.
   Four men were arrested and three surrendered to police Thursday,
said Duval County Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez.
Four others were arrested Wednesday. The suspects, 21 to 29 years
old, were charged with rape, kidnapping or rape and kidnapping.
Bonds were set at $20,000 to $50,000.
   ``Some of them we've brought in have admitted it. Some are not
talking,'' said Ricardo Carrillo, another assistant district
attorney.
   There may be more arrests, and the Texas Rangers will help local
authorities in the investigation, according to Jerry Galvan, an
investigator with the district attorney's office.
   San Diego, with a population of about 5,200 people, sits in
rolling hills covered with mesquite trees. Ranching, oil and
uranium mining are major industries in the area, but the biggest
employer is the county. Like many small South Texas towns, the
dominant buildings are the courthouse and the Roman Catholic church.
   ``You expect something like this to happen in Corpus (Christi)
or San Antonio or Dallas, but not in San Diego,'' said a woman, who
asked not to be identified because ``everybody knows everybody.''
   The 19-year-old victim told authorities she was walking home
Saturday night after visiting a relative when four men forced her
into a car and took her to a ranch north of town.
   She said the four and several others repeatedly raped her for
several hours in the back seat of a car while as many as 30 people
attending an illegal cockfight either ignored her pleas or joined
the attack.
   ``Some were holding her by the legs and by the arms, and some
were covering her eyes and mouth,'' Carrillo said.
   The mother of two said several of the men took her to another
remote location and raped her again before releasing her.
   Gutierrez said the woman knew some of her attackers and that
others were identified by witnesses, including a 12-year-old boy.
   ``The 12-year-old said (the victim) was screaming and crying and
told them to take her home,'' Gutierrez told the Corpus Christi
Caller-Times. ``They were just watching ... and she kept calling
for help.''
   The woman was treated at a Corpus Christi hospital and released
earlier this week.
   Carrillo said the woman's husband, who spent all night looking
for her after she disappeared, persuaded her to file charges Monday.
   Gutierrez said that people who stood by and did nothing may not
have been legally responsible for what happened, but said they were
morally obliged to help the woman.
   Schoolteacher Johnny Salinas said he wasn't surprised that
onlookers did nothing to help.
   ``These people feel a kinship with each other,'' he told the
Caller-Times. ``I would have tried to stop it, but then again you
might be afraid to try because you'd get beat up.''
   A 77-year-old woman told the newspaper she was appalled that no
one came forward to help.
   ``Poor girl, no one deserves anything like this,'' said
Esperanza Ibanez. ``What kind of barbarians would have done this to
her?''
