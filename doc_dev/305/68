   The Coast Guard gave up hope of
finding a woman and her two young children alive in the Gulf of
Mexico after their single-engine plane crashed in turbulent
weather, officials said.
   ``We are presuming all three have drowned,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Lt. Mark Kasper said Thursday.
   Sophia Mifsud, 26, her daughter, Ariel, 3, and 2-month-old son,
Martin, were lost after the Cessna 210 piloted by Mrs. Mifsud's
husband, Thomas, crashed in stormy weather about 8:30 p.m.
Wednesday, officials said.
   The husband was treated for shock, hypothermia and minor cuts at
Memorial Medical Hospital in Corpus Christi and released.
   Mifsud, 32, a U.S. citizen who lives in Guatemala, grabbed
Martin and swam about 100 feet to an oil rig after the crash. After
climbing onto the rig's ladder, a large swell washed his son from
his hands. Mifsud never saw his son again, said Coast Guard Lt.
Robin Starrett.
   Once atop the platform, Mifsud saw his wife and daughter
floating face down in heavy seas, he told officials.
   Mifsud tried to throw them a life preserver, but apparently
missed, Starrett said.
   ``I'm sure he was exhausted at that point, in addition to being
in shock,'' said Petty Officer Ron Atteberry said. ``It looks like
he did the best he could.''
   Mifsud called the Coast Guard from a telephone he found on the
unmanned oil platform.
   He reported that the planes engine failed on a flight from
Brownsville to Houston and he ditched about 30 miles off Palacios,
a town about halfway between Galveston and Corpus Christi.
