   Lawmen along the Texas coast braced
for another wave of tourists Monday after a wild weekend that
included a riot, four stabbings and two drownings.
   Hundreds of sailors will flood the coast near Galveston this
week when their ships dock, Navy officials said as law officers in
the surrounding areas made plans to bolster their forces.
   ``We're going to have to have more law enforcement,'' said J.P.
Luby, a county commissioner whose district includes nearly 20 miles
of public beaches.
   ``We want the spring breakers to have a good time, but things
should be worked out so that we have a better understanding of the
problems,'' he said.
   Over the weekend, eight spring break revelers were arrested
following a late-night riot, four stabbings and several drunken
driving incidents. Two San Antonio men were killed when their car
crashed through a flashing barrier and plunged off a ferry dock,
sinking in 20 to 25 feet of water.
   ``We had 35 units patrolling the area of Port Aransas and the
Padre Island National Seashore. But at night, there are not as many
to go around,'' Luby said. ``The Department of Public Safety had 18
officers out and that wasn't enough.''
   Luby said he and constables, police and emergency workers met
two weeks ago to prepare for the onslaught of college students
converging on Corpus Christi-area beaches.
   But no one was prepared for the fracas that erupted Saturday
night on nearby Mustang Island, he said.
   The melee erupted shortly before midnight when a motorist struck
a 16-year-old girl on the beach and then attempted to leave, said
Police Chief Don Perkins. Angry youths began to attack the driver,
but he was pulled away by police.
   The mob tipped over his car, smashed in the windows and set it
and a nearby portable toilet afire, police said.
   Police estimated there were 3,000 rioters and about 100 officers
on hand. Officials used tear gas and helicopters with search lights
to quell the uproar.
   Two law enforcement officers were injured in the melee. Four
people were stabbed in unrelated attacks, police said.
   ``The real problem is we have 21{ miles of beach in Nueces
County and Port Aransas has 3 miles and everyone congregates in an
area of about 1{ to 2 miles of beach,'' Luby said. ``You've got too
many people in a small area.''
   Authorities said it was calm along the beach Monday.
   Still, there is one more weekend of large crowds expected for
spring break before the Easter weekend, when more tourists are
expected.
   In Galveston, 230 miles to the northeast of here, officials say
1,650 sailors from the USS Lexington and two other Navy ships will
be mixing with the students.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jim Fallon in Dallas said the training vessel
USS Lexington, the submarine rescue platform ship USS Petrel and a
research submarine will be berthed at Galveston on Tuesday through
Friday.
   Many of the sailors who serve aboard the ships will get shore
leave during the visit, he said. He estimated about 1,000 sailors
will be off the ships at one time.
