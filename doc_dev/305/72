<HEAD>Senator Says Girl Scouts' Cookie Crunch Resolved</HEAD>

   A shipment of 402 boxes of Girl Scout cookies
will finally reach sailors aboard the USS Midway after being
blocked once by Japanese officials and returned to Corpus Christi,
Texas.
   ``That's good news for our sailors and for the Brownies from
Troop 807,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Monday while
announcing that the dispute with Japanee customs officials had been
resolved.
   Bentsen said the cookies should be on their way sometime today
now that Japanese officials have relented.
   Japanese customs officials initially blocked the shipment of
cookies from the Brownie troop in Corpus Christi and assessed a
$2,000 duty fee, which Brownie officials said was too steep for the
children.
   The cookies were shipped April 26, then spent four days in a
Japanese customs warehouse before being returned to the airport in
Corpus Christi.
   Thirty-five servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier had ordered
cookies from the Brownies, who had sent the men Christmas cards and
a Valentine's Day box of candy.
   The Midway's home port is Atsugi, Japan.
