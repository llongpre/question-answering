   Federal agents are investigating
suspected links between syndicated crime bosses in Chicago and a
cult-influenced drug ring blamed for 15 slayings near Matamoros,
Mexico, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Charles Harrison, agent in charge of the U.S. Customs regional
office in Houston, confirmed his agency is investigating a
relationship between Chicago mobsters and suspects in the Matamoros
drug and killings case, The Brownsville Herald reported.
   ``We can acknowledge we are looking into a relationship, but I
really can't go into any details,'' Harrison said. ``It's an ongoing
investigation.''
   Agents are looking into a possible narcotics and money laundering
enterprise involving the cult figures, the Chicago-based syndicate
and Manuel ``Poncho'' Jaramillo, who lives in Mission, Texas, the
newspaper reported, citing court transcripts, indictments,
affidavits and police records filed in drug and racketeering cases
from south Texas to Illinois.
   Jaramillo's associates include Albert Caesar Tocco, a reputed
Chicago mob boss arrested in January by FBI agents and charged in a
48-count federal racketeering indictment, the Herald reported.
   Other Jaramillo associates include members of the Matamoros-based
Hernandez family, which Mexican and U.S. agents believe was central
to a gruesome cult accused of slaying 15 people, according to
federal investigators. Some of the victims were sacrificed in
rituals intended to protect a narcotics ring, police said.
   Dennis Yates, a Houston attorney representing Jaramillo, called
drug and racketeering allegations against his client ``harassment.''
   ``Those accusations, as far as we're concerned, are absolutely
untrue,'' Yates said. ``They aren't substantiated, they have not
been substantiated and they never will be substantiated.''
   Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrested Serafin Hernandez
Garcia, 22, and his uncle, Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22, during an
April 9 drug raid at the family's ranch close to the Rio Grande near
Matamoros. There, they found the remnants of the ritual slayings and
unearthed 13 bodies.
   Police later found another two victims on a nearby ranch.
   Police have said the narcotics ring smuggled tons of marijuana
and cocaine into the United States.
   A principal figure in the Texas-Chicago investigation is Michael
Habiniak, 37, of Harlingen, the Herald reported. Habiniak was
convicted Jan. 11 in Corpus Christi on federal charges of conspiracy
and possession with intent to distribute marijuana on board a U.S.
vessel under American jurisdiction.
   Customs agents on Aug. 20, 1988, arrested Habiniak on a boat in
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and confiscated 597 pounds of
marijuana.
   A government motion filed in Habiniak's case alleged ``a criminal
enterprise connection between some of (Habiniak's) associates in the
Rio Grande Valley and in Chicago, Illinois, with Albert Caesar Tocco
of the Accardo organized crime family.''
   An investigation by the customs office in Corpus Christi revealed
Habiniak was a business partner of Ramona A. Jaramillo, Manuel
Jaramillo's wife at the time, in a Texas-based corporation named La
Esperanza Mining Co.
