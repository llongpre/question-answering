The 4th District Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a judge's order finding 
embattled San Diego lawyer Richard Degallegos in contempt of court for his 
failure to turn over a former client's files to another attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon found Degallegos in contempt for 
misbehavior, willful neglect and violation of his duty to a client. Degallegos 
was sentenced to five days in jail, but he filed a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus, prompting the appellate court to release him pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a three-judge panel of the court heard brief oral arguments from 
Degallegos and Deputy County Counsel Gary Seiser before issuing their decision 
denying the petition. In an 11-page ruling, the panel rejected Degallegos' 
claim that he was unaware that attorney Diane Campbell was seeking the files of 
his former client, Victoria Manriquez. The court noted that Campbell had 
written two letters requesting the materials. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also found that Degallegos had the ability to comply with 
Campbell's request to deliver the files but "willfully" failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos, 48, said he will appeal the decision. The court ordered the lawyer 
to surrender at the County Jail downtown at 9 a.m. March 15 unless a reversal 
or a stay of the order is granted by another court. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was signed by Acting Presiding Justice Howard Wiener and Justices 
William Todd and Richard Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Bar took over Degallegos' San Diego law practice after 
Superior Court Judge Michael Greer found Degallegos incapable of serving his 
clients. Degallegos is appealing Greer's order. The Bar also is pressing 
charges against the attorney in connection with many complaints from clients 
who claim he failed to complete work he was paid for, missed court appearances 
and misappropriated funds. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos also is under investigation by the county district attorney's office 
and a federal grand jury.
