   A Brownie troop's hopes of sending
Girl Scout cookies to U.S. sailors have been snarled in red tape
because of a half-baked $2,000 Japanese import tax slapped on the
goodies, a troop leader said Friday.
   The 402 boxes of Thin Mints, Golden Yangles, Scot Ts, Savannahs,
Jubilees, Classic Cremes and Hoedowns are piled up at the Corpus
Christi International Airport while officials try to figure out how
to get them to their destination.
   ``We thought there would be a small import fee, but not this
much,'' groused Marchetta White, leader of Brownie Troop 807 in
nearby Beeville.
   The 18 girls in the troop sold the cookies to crew members of
the USS Midway, berthed in Atsugi, Japan, and were eagerly awaiting
letters from the servicemen who bought them, Mrs. White said.
   American Airlines shipped the cookies April 26 to Japan without
charge. However, when Japanese customs officials demanded a $2,000
import tax, the boxes sat in a customs warehouse for four days
before being returned to Corpus Christi. They have been in storage
in one of the airline's offices this week.
   The troop's top cookie seller, 8-year-old Nickelle Clark, said
she did not like how the plan crumbled.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' she said. ``I'm mad.''
   Jean Titus, general manager for the airline in Corpus Christi,
said it probably will fly the cookies to Honolulu, where the Navy
will pick them up, but it could take several weeks for the shipment
to arrive.
   ``I'm quite sure that they will be leaving in the morning,'' she
added.
   Iso Mura, with the Department of Customs Inquiries in the
Japanese Embassy in Washington, said cookies would have a duty
equal to 24 percent of the item's value and its freight costs. He
said the $2,000 fee seemed high.
   ``It may be a mistake,'' Mura said.
   The cookie crisis even got Sen. Lloyd Bentsen involved. The
Texas Democrat has been working through diplomatic channels since
Thursday ``to get those cookies on the way to the sailors on the
Midway,'' a spokesman said.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Curtis Coker said
that if the situation were reversed, ``we would let it go right
through to the Japanese in their ship or at their base. You have to
apply a bit of common sense in regulating the food supply.''
   Mrs. White said that she chose the Midway because her son-in-law
is stationed on the ship, and that the Brownies have been
corresponding with the crew since they sent Christmas cards to the
sailors last year.
   Girl Scout leaders have not told all of the first-, second- and
third-graders that their cookie scheme met an international barrier.
   ``They decided at this point, since the cookies are going to get
to the sailors, they didn't want to complicate the Brownies'
lives,'' said Ann Diaz, executive director of the Paisano Girl
Scout Council in southern Texas.
   However, some of the girls' parents have told them about the
detained cookies.
   ``Some of the younger ones weren't real comprehending about what
happened, and the older ones do understand and are a little
disappointed the guys didn't get their cookies,'' Mrs. White said.
   Next time, she vowed, they will go through the military or the
mail.
