<HEAD>Navy Trio Says Untested Part Used On Navy Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two Navy airman and a former civilian co-worker
allege that untested parts from a wrecked Huey helicopter are being
used to keep a pair of rescue helicopters in operation at the
Navy's Corpus Christi base.
   Petty Officer Bryan Sims of Houston, and a former petty officer
who did not want to be identified, told the Houston Chronicle they
have been punished for objecting to the practice of installing
unproven parts from a Huey that crashed in 1985, killing three
crewmen.
   Their former co-worker, a mechanic, also asked not to be
identified, the Chronicle said.
   The former petty officer received an honorable discharge this
year. Sims, 27, faces a court-martial. Both maintain that
accusations against them, ranging from alcohol abuse to losing
gear, are false.
   Sims, a helicopter mechanic still assigned to the Corpus Christi
Naval Air Station, says gauges, hydraulic equipment and flight
control rods were switched from the wrecked helicopter to the pair
still in service.
   A base spokesman said the Hueys have been tested and are safe,
but he would not immediately discuss how spare parts are obtained.
   Lt. Barbara Kent, a spokeswoman at Navy headquarters in
Washington, said the Navy does not routinely use parts from wrecked
equipment.
   She said any part that is recovered from a damaged aircraft
``must be properly tested and certified ready for issue.''
   ``Any naval aircraft which has had maintenance performed on a
part of the flight control system, engine or any other
safety-of-flight related component or system, is flight tested
before final clearance for normal operations,'' Kent added.
   The three who talked to the Chronicle said orders to transfer
the parts were issued by chief petty officers, and the parts were
not examined or tested before being installed.
   The mechanic told the newspaper that the helicopters could crash
if the control rods malfunction.
   Sims and the other men acknowledged they have no proof that the
recycled parts have malfunctioned during flight.
   The Hueys are used primarily to rescue airmen from trouble
during training flights from bases in Corpus Christi, Beeville and
Kingsville. They also back up the Coast Guard during any rescues of
civilians in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Base spokesman Lt. Robert Stevens said the Hueys are being
inspected by an Army maintenance team and are safe. The
inspections, he said, are not in response to objections from any
airmen.
   Base commander Capt. C.L. Reynolds said the Navy ``is not
attempting to harass or discriminate against'' Sims.
   Personnel records supplied by Sims contain several positive
assessments. But, Sims said, he started receiving negative ratings
in 1986 after he refused an order to transfer a control arm from
the wrecked helicopter, which was stored outdoors, to a working one.
   One 1988 evaluation says Sims should not remain in the service
because he is ``self-serving and self-seeking'' and has ``a sullen,
arrogant and condescending attitude.''
   None of the criticisms mentions any refusal by Sims to transfer
the helicopter parts.
