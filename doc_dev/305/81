   A house fire apparently caused by an
electrical short circuit killed a woman and her four children early
Sunday, authorities said. Two other relatives pulled from the
burning home were critically injured.
   The woman's husband, Joe Amador, learned of the tragedy when he
returned home from work and found firefighters battling the blaze.
   ``He told me thanks to his faith he wasn't going crazy.
Otherwise he wouldn't be able to face this tragedy,'' said the
family's pastor, the Rev. Jesus Garcia of Sacred Heart Roman
Catholic Church in Mathis, a town of about 7,000 in southern Texas,
30 miles northwest of Corpus Christi.
   Neighbors discovered the fire and called the Mathis Volunteer
Fire Department about 2 a.m., said Fire Chief Larry Wallek. He said
Department of Public Safety troopers made their way into the
burning home and carried out a woman and her grandchild.
   Nicolosa Gonzalez Amador, 67, and her grandson, Michael Rosales,
1{, were in critical condition at Corpus Christi hospitals,
officials said.
   The victims were identified as Yolanda Lopez Amador, 29; her
daughters, Yvette Amador, 2{, Leslie Angelica Amador, 4, and Lisa
Amador, 8; and son, Joe Angel Lopez, 9.
   Yolanda Lopez Amador was the daughter-in-law of Nicolosa
Gonzalez Amador and the aunt of Michael Rosales, who was staying
with the family for the night.
