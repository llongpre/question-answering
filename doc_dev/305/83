   A judge today ordered state officials to
release a carpenter who has been jailed for 18 months under the
state's 156-year-old sodomy law after he admitted having oral sex
with his wife.
   DeKalb County Superior Judge Robert Castellani ordered the state
to free James Moseley on his own recognizance by 3 p.m. unless a
satisfactory reason for keeping him in jail is found.
   Moseley, 35, was convicted in February 1988 on one charge of
sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison after he testified that
he engaged in oral sex with Bette Roberts, his common-law wife of
four years. The couple have since divorced, and Ms. Roberts won
custody of their two children.
   Castellani ruled that Moseley be freed until it could be
determined if he should have a new trial or if his conviction should
be overturned.
   Moseley, of Clayton County, was charged with two counts of rape,
two counts of aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated
anal sodomy in connection with two encounters with Ms. Roberts. He
was acquitted of those charges, but a jury found him guilty of
sodomy because of his admission on the witness stand.
   Sodomy, even between a consenting husband and wife, is a felony
in Georgia. Moseley is believed to be the first man convicted under
the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners.
   In today's hearing, Clive Stafford Smith, an attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union, argued that state prosecutors should
be required to disqualify themselves from the case if they had
engaged in oral sex.
   Castellani declined to order prosecutors to reveal such
information.
   The judge gave Moseley's attorneys until Tuesday to review
transcripts from the original trial and to file additional motions
in the case. They were seeking a writ of habeas corpus which, if
granted, would void Moseley's conviction and free him. Failing that,
he wants a new trial.
   Steven E. Lister, Moseley's original lawyer, testified today that
he advised Moseley not to appeal the conviction because he believed
an appeal would delay a release from the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles.
   Smith argued that Lister's advice effectively deprived Moseley of
his right to appeal.
   Senior Assistant Attorney General Mary Beth Westmoreland said the
state was not trying to interfere in private marital relations, but
became involved because of Ms. Roberts' contention that she did not
consent to the acts.
