   An anthology of English poetry has
been returned to the library _ 50 years and six days overdue.
   The copy of W.H. Auden's ``The Oxford Book of Light Verse'' was
returned Monday, said Gloria Garcia, automation coordinator for the
Corpus Christi Public Library.
   ``We were in shock,'' Ms. Garcia said.
   The date-due card was stamped Aug. 21, 1940. It had been checked
out from the old La Retama Library, which was the city's central
library for 75 years until 1986, when the Corpus Christi Public
Library opened.
   The tattered book was returned by an unidentified man, described
by a library worker as in his 30s.
   ``He just said that he and his wife had been going through some
stuff and found the book,'' said Joan Roith, a city reference
librarian. ``I teasingly asked if he'd like to pay the fine and he
just laughed.''
   The book was so ``old and moldy,'' Ms. Roith said the library
probably won't put it back on the shelves, let alone levy a fine.
   The maximum fine would only have amounted to $4.47, or half the
book's current $8.95 purchase price, said Mark Gretchen, the
library's reference services manager.
   ``The maximum fine we ever charge is half the price of the book
because we don't want to discourage people from returning overdue
books,'' Gretchen said.
   Since the library didn't retain its old records when it
converted to a computerized checkout system two years ago, the
borrower's identity probably will remain a mystery.
   ``Even if we could identify him, we couldn't divulge the name.
All of that is confidential,'' Gretchen said.
