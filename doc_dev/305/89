   Healthcare International Inc., an Austin, Texas, hospital
management company operating under bankruptcy-court
protection, said two of its units filed bankruptcy petitions
after a landlord tried to terminate two leases in Corpus
Christi, Texas.
   The company said that Safecare Co., the landlord at its
Bayview psychiatric hospital, notified it that Safecare had
terminated the leases for the hospital and a medical office
building, and had arranged for a Columbia Hospital Corp.
affiliate to take over the facilities effective Feb. 1.

   Healthcare said it refused to relinquish possession of the
68-bed hospital and adjoining office building and sought
Chapter 11 protection for its Healthcare Corpus Christi Inc.
and Bayview Management Co. units. Healthcare, which said it
didn't receive prior notice of the terminations, said its
rents are current and that it intends to contest Safecare's
move.
   Healthcare and certain nonoperating subsidiaries filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in
Austin last November.
