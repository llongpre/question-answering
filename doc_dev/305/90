   A state court jury in Corpus Christi, Texas, awarded $30
million in punitive damages to the parents of a girl born
with birth defects allegedly because her mother took
Bendectin, an anti-nausea prescription drug, while she was
pregnant.
   The jury also found that Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.
should pay Ernest and Marilyn Havner $3.8 million in
compensatory damages. Bendectin, which was taken off the
market in 1983, has been the target of suits filed by at
least 1,800 women who took the drug during pregnancy.

   David Thompson, a spokesman for Merrell-Dow, now part of
Marion Merrell Dow Inc. in Cincinnati, said the company would
seek a new trial or appeal the verdict. Mr. Thompson said the
company had won 33 of the 35 Bendectin cases decided.
   Although some juries have been sympathetic to the plight
of Bendectin's alleged victims, several verdicts have been
overturned on appeal, in part because judges have failed to
find compelling the scientific evidence presented by the
plaintiffs.
   Barry J. Nace, the Washington, D.C., lawyer who
represented the parents of Kelly Havner, who was born in 1982
with birth defects, said that the $33.8 million award was the
second largest ever in a Bendectin case. Mr. Nace in 1987 won
a $95 million award in a Bendectin case tried in Washington.
That award, which included $75 million in punitive damages
was subsequently overturned.
   Mr. Nace, who has handled many Bendectin cases, said that
Merrell-Dow had inflated its win-loss record in the cases and
that he believed plaintiffs had won about half the cases. He
criticized federal judges for throwing out Bendectin
verdicts, saying they think "they know more than the juries,
that they're smarter and that they're not going to let {jury
verdicts} stand."
   George E. Berry, one of the lawyers for Merrell-Dow in the
Corpus Christi case, said that he would file a motion in
District Court of Nueces County arguing that the punitive
damages awarded should immediately be cut to $15 million. Mr.
Berry, of the Santa Monica, Calif., law firm Dickson, Carlson
&amp; Campillo, said the Texas Tort Reform Act of 1987 requires
that punitive damages, which are meant to punish and prevent
egregious behavior, not exceed four times the actual damages
awarded in a case.
   Mr. Nace, of the Washington law firm Paulson, Nace,
Norwind &amp; Sellinger, said he did not believe the statute
would apply in this case.
   Mr. Thompson, the company spokesman, said that there was
no scientific evidence to prove that Bendectin caused birth
defects. He said the drug is still approved by U.S. and
foreign regulatory agencies and was taken off the market
because of the "costs and pressures resulting from
litigation."
