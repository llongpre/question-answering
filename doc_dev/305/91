   Three people were missing from a
private, single-engine plane that crashed into the Gulf of Mexico
Wednesday night, Coast Guard officials said.
   The Cessna 210 with four people aboard went down about 30 miles
south of Palacios at 8:27 p.m. while en route from Brownsville to
Houston, said Petty Officer Steve Guy at Coast Guard district
headquarters in New Orleans.
   A man who was in the plane swam to a nearby oil platform and was
talking by cellular telephone to a Coast Guard duty officer in
Galveston, said Petty Officer Clifton Vigus in Corpus Christi. The
Coast Guard was trying to pinpoint the location of the platform and
rescue craft had been dispatched.
   The other three people were unaccounted for, Vigus said.
   Palacios is a coastal community about halfway between Corpus
Christi and Galveston.
