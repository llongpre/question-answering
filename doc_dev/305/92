   Like the grubby beggars on the streets
thrusting out their plastic coffee cups, Mitch Snyder was a goad.
   Unlike them, he would not be brushed aside.
   He made the destitute of this city visible. He got a roof over
their heads.
   He could be a nuisance. He could exasperate the city and the
citizenry. He drove critics and allies to distraction by an
insistent demand that the homeless be accorded the respect due
humankind.
   Now that he is dead, it dawned on Washington _ Washington the
community, not Washington the world capital _ what he meant to this
city.
   The dispossessed will have to fend for themselves. And so will
the possessed. The goad is gone. It will be up to people to see the
helpless poor without him.
   By common estimate, 15,000 homeless people live on the streets
and grates of Washington.
   One of Snyder's triumphs was the enactment of a 1984 law _ by
the citizens, in an initiative, over the objections of officialdom
_ compelling the city to guarantee them an indoor place to spend
the night.
   Of that number, 1,200 found a spot in the shelter that Snyder,
in his guerrilla warfare, wrestled from Ronald Reagan in 1984.
   He did that by fasting for 51 days. Snyder looked then like he
was nearly dead. CBS cameras were about to capture the showdown for
``60 Minutes.'' The presidential election was two days off.
   Reagan capitulated and gave Snyder's outfit, the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, a tumbledown federal building a few blocks
from the Capitol for use as a shelter and $6 million to
rehabilitate it.
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., didn't like the show boating. He
called Snyder ``a masochist who influences government by
threatening to starve himself.''
   Snyder had a genius for attracting attention. But no one ever
accused him of capitalizing on the poor. He hobnobbed with
celebrities, coming to their parties in the wrinkled clothes given
to the shelter. He always needed a shave.
   He held public funerals for homeless people who died on the
streets in the cold. He scavenged through dumpsters with members of
Congress. Once, he got movie stars to spend a night sleeping on the
street. He got Cher to dish out the mashed potatoes at Christmas
dinner at the shelter.
   He got the Navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear submarine
Corpus Christi, after the city in Texas. He said no warship should
bear the name ``the body of Christ,'' and the Navy changed it to
the USS City of Corpus Christi. That fast lasted only 11 days.
   But angry, scornful, confrontational Mitch Snyder had failures,
too. He walked out of a middle-class marriage, leaving behind in
New York City two small children and forcing his wife onto welfare.
He said he could not spend his life selling Electrolux vacuum
cleaners and Maytag washing machines.
   Eleven days ago, Snyder suffered his greatest defeat. He could
not keep the city council from voting to gut the homeless shelter
law or slashing spending on the destitute.
   The change, awaiting Mayor Marion Barry's signature, would
require homeless people to go though a screening process before
being approved for shelter.
   Washington has accustomed itself to the sight of people sleeping
on the streets. The outrage and passion have diminished.
   There were suggestions that difficulties with Carol Fennelly,
Snyder's companion for 15 years, led him to take his life.
   In his room at the shelter where he hanged himself, Snyder left
behind a note discussing his failed love relationship with Ms.
Fennelly, police sources said. He was 46.
   Maybe he was a victim of that disease of the upwardly mobile:
burnout. He had been at it for 17 years.
