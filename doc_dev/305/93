   Disregarding Iran's antagonism toward America,
U.S. church agencies have sent money and supplies to help the
thousands of victims of the devastating June 21 earthquake in the
northwestern part of the country.
   Church World Service, relief arm of the National Council of
Churches, last week airlifted 5,606 pounds of antibiotics, blood
bags and disinfectants valued at $286,557, assembled in cooperation
with Interchurch Medical Assistance.
   CWS also has raised $50,000 from member denominations as part of
a $150,000 appeal to meet needs for food, tents and sanitation
equipment in Iran, where an estimated 40,000 were killed, 60,000
injured and half a million left homeless.
   ``We are not looking at the political behavior of the Iranian
government, but at the needs of the Iranian people,'' said the Rev.
Dale Bishop of the NCC's Middle East office.
   Feed the Children of Larry Jones International Ministries in
Oklahoma City shipped 40 tons of medical supplies, food and
clothings. Catholic Relief Services gathered donations for victims,
and Lutheran World Relief sent 21,591 pounds of quilts and clothing
valued at $35,567 as an initial response, while United Methodism's
disaster relief agency sent an initial emergency grant of $10,000.
   U.S. churches are working with the Middle East Council of
Churches and the Iranian Red Crescent in coordinating aid.

   A synod of the Christian (Old)
Catholic Church of Switzerland has decided that the ``faith of the
church'' does not require that only men be ordained priests.
   Old Catholics in Germany also have voted in favor of ordination
of women. Old Catholics, also found in notable numbers in the
Netherlands, Austria, Canada and the United States, broke from Rome
over the 1870 edict of papal infallibility.

   Calling for ``even-handed treatment'' of the
Unification Church, its new president in America, the Rev. James A.
Baughman, says:
   ``The bottom line is that we no longer tolerate irresponsible
journalism. We will fight gratuitous use of the `Moonie'' or `cult'
pejoratives.''
   Those terms often have been applied to the group founded by the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon in 1954 in Seoul, South Korea, and spread in
this country in the 1970's.
   Baughman, who succeeds the Rev. Moses Durst, promised an
aggressive campaign against misconceptions and distortions about
the church.
