   The Unification Church's new president in
America, the Rev. James A. Baughman, says the church is not given
``even-handed treatment'' by the press.
   ``The bottom line is that we no longer tolerate irresponsible
journalism. We will fight gratuitous use of the `Moonie'' or `cult'
pejoratives,'' he said.
   Those terms often have been applied to the group founded by the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon in 1954 in Seoul, South Korea, and spread in
this country in the 1970s.
   Baughman, who succeeds the Rev. Moses Durst, promised an
aggressive campaign against what he called misconceptions and
distortions about the church.

of women. Old Catholics, also found in notable numbers in the

   Disregarding Iran's antagonism toward the United
States, American church agencies sent money and supplies to help
the thousands of victims of the devastating June 21 earthquake in
the northwestern part of the country.
   Church World Service, relief arm of the National Council of
Churches, flew 5,606 pounds of antibiotics, blood bags and
disinfectants valued at $286,557, assembled in cooperation with
Interchurch Medical Assistance.
   Church World Service also raised $50,000 from member
denominations as part of a $150,000 appeal to meet needs for food,
tents and sanitation equipment in Iran, where an estimated 40,000
people were killed, 60,000 injured and half a million left homeless.
   ``We are not looking at the political behavior of the Iranian
government, but at the needs of the Iranian people,'' said the Rev.
Dale Bishop of the National Council of Churches' Middle East office.
   Feed the Children of Larry Jones International Ministries in
Oklahoma City shipped 40 tons of medical supplies, food and
clothings. Catholic Relief Services gathered donations for victims,
and Lutheran World Relief sent 21,591 pounds of quilts and clothing
valued at $35,567 as an initial response, while United Methodism's
disaster relief agency sent an initial emergency grant of $10,000.
   American churches are working with the Middle East Council of
Churches and the Iranian Red Crescent in coordinating aid.
