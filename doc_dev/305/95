<TEXT>     Lower courts said such prayers violate the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.;    In the appeal acted on today, Providence
school officials said acknowledging God at such times does not amount to a
governmental endorsement of religion.;    The high court since 1962 has banned
organized prayer sessions from public schools. But Providence school officials
and the Bush administration told the justices that prayers at graduation
ceremonies are different.;    The school officials' appeal called such prayers
part of "the longstanding and broad tradition of official acknowledgment of
religious values in the public life of the nation.";    The appeal noted that
invocations and benedictions are recited in state legislatures across the
nation and in the Congress and that all Supreme Court public sessions begin
with the invocation, "God save the United States and this honorable court.";  
 Justice Department lawyers urged the scrapping in some cases of a three-part
test the court has used repeatedly since 1971 in deciding whether a
governmental practice violates that part of the Constitution banning "an
establishment of religion.";    Under the test, the governmental practice is
struck down if it does not have a secular purpose, advances or promotes
religion or fosters excessive entanglement with religion.;    The government
lawyers said the court should "jettison the framework erected by (the
three-part test) in circumstances where, as here, the practice under assault
is non-coercive, ceremonial acknowledgment of the heritage of a deeply
religious people.";    "Whatever special concerns about subtle coercion may be
present in the classroom setting -- where inculcation is the name of the game
-- they do not carry over into the commencement setting, which is more
properly understood as a civic ceremony than part of the education mission,"
the government lawyers said.;    The prayers in Providence were challenged two
years ago by Daniel Weisman when his daughter, Deborah, was a student at
Nathan Bishop Junior High School.;    Weisman, who practices Judaism, objected
when Rabbi Leslie Gutterman was scheduled to give an invocation and
benediction at his daughter's graduation ceremony.;    Weisman's lawyers said
he is "opposed to and offended by inclusion of prayer in public school . . .
graduation ceremonies.";    A federal judge and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled for Weisman.;    In another ruling today, the court refused to
reinstate a libel lawsuit against a Texas newspaper by a former state social
worker who says a false 1985 article destroyed her life.;    The court,
without comment, let stand rulings that defeated Elda Villarreal's suit
against the Corpus Christi Times.;    Villarreal had urged the justices to
rule she wrongly was found to be a "public official" who could not win a libel
suit without proving the article was published with knowledge or reckless
disregard of its falsity.;    Since a landmark 1964 Supreme Court ruling,
public officials and public figures who sue for libel must prove such "actual
malice." But private citizens can win libel suits by proving only that the
statement in contention was false and was made negligently.;    The 1964
ruling and subsequent decisions made it more difficult for those in the public
eye to win libel suits. But those rulings have never said specifically how far
down into the lower ranks of government employees the "public official"
designation extends.;    Villarreal was working as a child protective services
specialist for the Texas Department of Human Resources in Nueces County when
she was mentioned in one paragraph of a 1985 Corpus Christi Times article
about two preteen girls who had been made prostitutes by their family.;    The
article said, "Though police files dating to 1982 cite the 12-year-old as a
shoplifter, runaway and curfew violator, welfare agent Elda Villarreal did not
petition the court to remove the children until Jan. 25.";    The article did
not mention that Villarreal was first assigned to the children's case two days
previously, on Jan. 23.;    The appeal acted on today said, "The newspaper
destroyed" Villarreal's life. The appeal said she was ostracized at her work
and then fired. "Even though a court reinstated her in her job, she was
treated like a pariah by her fellow workers," it said.;     Other actions;   
Other decisions today by the Supreme Court:; (box)Punitive damages -- The
court sent back to lower courts for further study seven disputes over punitive
damage awards, including California cases involving former members of the Hare
Krishna religion and the Church of Scientology.; (box)Racial bias -- Justices
ordered a federal appeals court to restudy a ruling that the manufacturer of
Buster Brown shoes was guilty of illegal racial bias when it fired a white
supervisor at a Missouri warehouse.; (box)Minimum age -- The court agreed to
let states set minimum-age requirements for their legislators, leaving intact
Missouri's minimum age of 24.; (box)Libel suit -- Justices refused to
reinstate a libel lawsuit against the Corpus Christi (Texas) Times by a former
state social worker who says a false 1985 article destroyed her life.; (box)VA
negligence -- The court agreed to consider awarding more money to the widow of
a Wisconsin man left in a coma-like condition because of negligence at a
veterans hospital.; (box)Drunk driving -- Justices refused to let Connecticut
authorities file new, more serious charges against a drunken driver who ran
over a 13-year-old boy two years ago. They rejected arguments that prosecutors
should be free to file manslaughter charges against Susan Nelson, who pleaded
guilty to the lesser crime of vehicular assault before the boy died.; (This
