   Parishioners of Corpus Christi
Catholic Church received a written apology from one of their
priests Sunday for his public criticism of Pope John Paul II during
last weekend's Masses.
   ``I apologize for the injudicious use of the phrase `dead wrong'
with regard to the Holy Father's stand concerning celibacy for the
diocesan clergy,'' the Rev. Anthony Curran said in a letter printed
in Sunday's church bulletins.
   ``I acknowledge that I was in violation of canon law in speaking
publicly on the matter.''
   Curran's criticism of the pope's position on celibacy came a
week after a former Corpus Christi priest, the Rev. Anton Mowat,
was indicted on charges of molesting four altar boys at the church
in suburban Atlanta.
   Curran was summoned to Atlanta on Tuesday to meet with Monsignor
John McDonough, administrator of the Atlanta archdiocese. After the
meeting, church officials announced that Curran would write a brief
letter of clarification to parishioners but would not be
disciplined.
   Curran said he still thinks church officials need to deal with
the pressures on priests caused by the celibacy requirement and
other factors.
   ``The letter is an apology for saying the pope is `dead
wrong,''' he said. ``I am not recanting my statements about the
pain I have seen in the priesthood.''
