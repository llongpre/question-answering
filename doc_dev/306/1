   Forty years after a copy writer for a small
advertising agency took a taffy-like substance invented by accident
and called it Silly Putty, the toy in the plastic egg is still
making an impression.
   Binney &amp; Smith Inc., Silly Putty's maker, sells more than 3
million eggs a year of the bounceable, moldable, stretchable toy
capable of lifting images from newspapers.
   And this spring, the Easton-based company plans to add four
fluorescent colors of Silly Putty to the pinkish silicone rubber.
   These colors mark the first change in the product since Peter C.
Hodgson borrowed $147 in 1950 to market a researcher's failed
attempt at making synthetic rubber during World War II.
   ``Dads and moms may get a little jealous because they didn't
have these things, but maybe their kids will share,'' said Dennis
Malloy, Binney &amp; Smith's director of business development.
   The privately held company, which also makes Crayola crayons and
Liquitex fine arts products, bought the rights to Silly Putty in
1977, a year after Hodgson's death.
   Hodgson's son, Peter Jr., said Silly Putty's simplicity has
allowed it to stretch over two generations.
   ``It demands something of people so it animates you,'' said
Hodgson, a professor of Russian literature at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``It really is what it says it is: a liquid solid,'' he said.
``It's just a paradox, a kind of puzzle, an enigma you can hold in
your hand.''
   The elder Hodgson, who envisioned Silly Putty as a therapeutic
diversion for adults, began the business in a converted barn in
North Branford, Conn., and shipped the product to retailers in
pasteboard egg crates.
   Since then, more than 200 million eggs of Silly Putty _ more
than 3,000 tons _ have been sold.
   Silly Putty, which has survived copycats such as Nutty Putty and
Goofy Goo, has been pressed into service in some unusual ways.
   The elder Hodgson gave Apollo 8 astronauts Silly Putty in
sterling silver eggs for their 1968 trip to the moon, and they used
it to keep tools from floating away in weightlessness.
   Athletes squeeze it to strengthen their hands, and physical
therapists recommend it for patients recovering from hand or wrist
injuries.
   And New York City artist George Horner uses Silly Putty in his
work, which sells for as much as $5,000.
   ``I do consider myself a serious artist even though I work with
Silly Putty,'' said Horner, whose works inside Silly Putty-filled
frames address topics such as homelessness and AIDS. ``I sort of
like to fool people's expectations.''
   Malloy said he expects Silly Putty to continue to thrive _ even
in the age of the video game.
   ``I think a parent is ecstatic when a child requests a toy that
costs a buck and a half,'' he said.
   According to Malloy, baby boomers' children have hatched a Silly
Putty sales increase of 15 percent to 17 percent during the last
four years.
   He said he expects sales to grow by 25 percent to 30 percent
this year as children collect the new blue, green, yellow and
magenta colors scheduled to reach retail stores' shelves in May.
   But Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, said he didn't
think children would collect the different colors.
   ``Silly Putty is more of a one-trick pony,'' he said.
   At the modern plant in northeastern Pennsylvania, Binney &amp; Smith
makes an average of 300 pounds a day of Silly Putty, about 12,000
eggs a day.
   To make Silly Putty, silicone rubber is first swirled in
225-pound blobs with ingredients to keep it from puddling.
   After the pink goo _ warm from the stirring _ is poured from the
vat designed to mix mortar, it is cut up into chunks resembling
oversized loaves of homemade bread.
   These are then fed through a machine designed for cutting taffy.
Rows of Silly Putty drop onto a conveyer, and workers place the
13.3-gram disks resembling chopped hot dogs into red plastic eggs.
   Malloy said he expected the old-fashioned pink putty to continue
to sell well despite the bright colors and other innovations on the
drawing board.
   ``This isn't the last you'll see of new things in Silly Putty,''
he promised.
