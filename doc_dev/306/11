<LEADPARA>  Q I bought a heat gun to remove window putty so I could reglaze my windows.
The manufacturer recommended I buy a deflector for the gun for this purpose.; 
 I bought the attachment and I broke the glass on the first window I worked
on. Does heat work?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A Heat works, but with care. You'll have better luck with glass that has been
slowly warmed by the sun than with glass that is cool.;   To minimize breakage
use the deflector, but also tape a wide strip of Lytherm, a paper-like
insulating material, to the glass adjacent to the putty. Don't use more heat
than what is required to soften the putty and don't chip the putty out; wait
until it softens.;   Q I've had new carpet installed and now several doors
stick. How can I trim the doors without repainting them?;   A Very carefully!
Don't trim off too much. Remember the old saying, "measure twice and cut
once.";   Wrap masking tape around the door bottom. The tape should be wider
than what will be trimmed off, as you will mark your cutting line on it, and
it will also help keep the cut edge from splintering. With a pencil, mark the
tape at a point not more than 14 inches above the highest point of the floor
covering.;   Remove the door. Use a straight edge and a sharp knife to score
through the tape and into the surface of the door along the line to be cut.;  
Clamp a piece of wood across the door as a saw guide, adjusting the distance
from the cutting line for either a hand or power saw. (If using a power saw,
tape the foot -- the underside -- of the saw to prevent scratching the door.)
Use a sharp blade and cut slowly and evenly.;   Remove the masking tape by
peeling it off toward the cut. Seal the cut edge with a good quality primer or
wood sealer to retard moisture being "wicked-up" into the door.;   Q When I
install a vanity on a ceramic tile floor, how do I get a tight fit to the
floor? It seems if you don't get a tight fit, dust and water could get under
the vanity.;   A Once you have the cabinet scribed and cut for a tight fit to
the wall and the best fit you can obtain to the floor, make a "snake" out of
plumber's putty and adhere it to the surfaces of the cabinet that will touch
the tiles. Put the cabinet in place and apply downward pressure and twist at
the same time, the same procedure as setting a toilet in place. Then secure
the cabinet to the wall.  </TEXT>
