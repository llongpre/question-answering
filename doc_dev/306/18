   Q. _ The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can
handle most of the job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling
the few spots where there are openings in the wall without anything
behind them. Can I apply masking tapes over each opening and then
cover with a patching compound?
   A. _ Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill
is a ready-made patch available in most paint stores and home
centers. Tape it on according to the directions and you will find
it easy to disguise the patch when it is painted.

   Q. _ One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone
haywire. I am fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can
the cord be removed or is it too much of a job?
   A. _ Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the
stop mouldings on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work
very carefully, especially if you intend to use the mouldings
again. If your aim is to replace the sash cord with another of the
same type, be sure to observe how the cord is connected so you will
be able to replace it without too much trouble. Before you do this,
however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the market. They
are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible.

   Q. _ We want to paint the concrete walkway around the swimming
pool at the back of our house. Can a latex paint be used or is it
better to use an oil-based paint?
   A. _ Latex paint formulated for use on concrete is generally
considered better than an oil-based paint for such a purpose. Epoxy
paints are considered tops, but cost more.

   Q. _ We have an old bedroom bureau. It seems in very good shape,
but the finish is kind of messy. We do not know what kind of finish
it is, except we know it isn't paint. Will we be able to remove it
with an ordinary varnish remover or is something special required
if the finish is shellac, lacquer or something else?
   A. _ Go ahead with the varnish remover. The finish will yield to
it whether it is varnish, shellac or lacquer. What will determine
the toughness of your job is how many coats are on it. After the
varnish remover is left on the amount of time recommended on the
label, try a little scraping with a putty knife or scraper. If it
yields fairly easy, go ahead with the work. If it seems to resist,
apply another coat of remover without disturbing the coat already
there.
