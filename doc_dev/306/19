DON'T GET TIED UP ON REMOVING SASH CORDS 
</P>

QUESTION: One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone haywire. I am 
fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can the cord be removed or is 
it too much of a job? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings 
on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially 
if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash 
cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is 
connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Before you do this, however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the 
market. They are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible.

Can Plywood Be Nailed Directly to Studs? 
</P>
<P>
Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by 
nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is 
much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the 
studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail 
to the studs? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs 
warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven. The furring 
strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method, 
you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it. In any case, no matter 
which method of installation you use, buy the plywood ahead of time so it can 
be kept in the room several days before application. This will give it time to 
acclimate.

Powdered Pumice: Where to Buy It 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently told someone about using powdered pumice to smooth the surface 
of a piece of furniture that had just been finished. I was unable to get it in 
my local hardware store, which referred me to the local pharmacy. Sure enough, 
the drug store carried it. Thought your readers would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. While most hardware stores and home center dealers carry the 
powdered pumice, so do some drug stores and some art supply establishments.

Sawing Metal Takes Different Strokes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have cut a lot of wood, but I have never used a hacksaw. This time I have 
to cut some metal. Is there any trick to it or do I just saw the same way as 
with a crosscut saw? 
</P>
<P>
A: Forget about the way you cut wood. With a hacksaw, you do not apply pressure 
on the backstroke. The hacksaw must be held as flat as possible for an even 
cut. Put the pressure on the forward stroke, release the pressure on the back 
stroke. When possible, keep both hands on the hacksaw frame. Start the cut with 
several short foward strokes. When putting the blade in the frame, the teeth 
should slant forward.

Should Molding on Plywood Be Glued? 
</P>
<P>
Q: To cover the edges of plywood, I plan on attaching molding to them. Should I 
use glue or nails or what? 
</P>
<P>
A: Use glue and then a couple of well-placed nails. Depending on the kind of 
project you are working on, the finishing nails can be driven a bit below the 
surface and the indentations filled with wood putty or other filler.

Patches Available for Hiding Holes in Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can handle most of the 
job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling the few spots where there are 
openings in the wall without anything behind them. Can I apply masking tape 
over each opening and then cover with a patching compound? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill is a ready-made 
patch available in most paint stores and home centers. Tape it on according to 
the directions and you will find it easy to disguise the patch when it is 
painted.
