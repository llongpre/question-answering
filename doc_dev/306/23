Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant set in a shopping 
mall. Two chefs are in charge of the kitchen -- one is Cuban, the other 
Vietnamese. If you are wondering about the connection, I have a good 
explanation. The chefs are married. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese dishes here are as good as you'll find in Little Saigon. 
Imperial salad is a bowlful of cold, rice noodles and leafy greens with 
vinegared carrot, crushed peanut, barbecued pork and shrimp, plus Vietnamese 
egg rolls (crisper and more densely filled than in the rest of Asia). 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's five-spice chicken, a large plate of sauteed chicken and 
winter vegetables, is made with a pungent spice mixture that permeates every 
bite. You can also get Vietnamese fried rice, beef with mint and chili, and bun 
bo (beef noodle soup). 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Cuban dishes -- wonderful ham croquettes, for instance, 
which are crispy, deviled cylinders served with greaseless fried plantain chips 
and perfect roulades of smoky ham and Emmentaler cheese. Even smokier is the 
puree of green peas in hot soup form with chicharrones crumbled on top. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Cuban entrees, I sampled the picadillo and the pan de bistec. I can 
recommend both. Picadillo is ground beef served over rice with plenty of 
onions, garlic and raisins in a highly seasoned tomato stock. It's like a 
sophisticated Sloppy Joe. Pan de bistec (available only at lunch) is thinly 
sliced brisket on a soft roll with a large heap of grilled onions. 
</P>
<P>
If you come at night, you can choose from a French menu that includes 
choucroute garni and couscous Mediterranean with orange chili oil. Desserts 
like cascas, guava paste over white cheese, and a good rice pudding and flan 
are always available. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is inexpensive. Lunch items range from $2.95 to $5.95. Dinners are 
from $5.95 to $13.95.

As the carriage wheel in the parking lot indicates, a calesa is a horse-drawn 
carriage used in the Philippines. But Calesa, the restaurant, is a richly 
luxurious place that wouldn't look out of place in any first-class hotel in the 
Philippine capital. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent lanterns made from a Filipino shell called capiz are suspended over 
cloth-draped tables and ornate stainless steel carvings are placed throughout 
the dining room. Waiters wear tuxedoes and flame things at tables with great 
pomp and ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The motto here is "Around the World Dining," and indeed the menu is defiantly 
eclectic here. Everything from paella to Indonesian sate to pure 
Continental-style desserts (e.g., baked Alaska) shows up on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best dishes here is an appetizer called gambas al ajillo, a remnant 
Filipino favorite from colonial days. It's a sizzling casserole of golden brown 
shrimp with lots of minced garlic and crusty, oil-rubbed bread. The Shanghai 
fried lumpia are good shrimp and pork egg rolls, unfortunately served with a 
forgettable sweet red sauce that is supposed to be sour. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken tara -- grilled cutlets with sticky pineapple and mango chutneys on the 
side -- sounds intriguing, but is so sweet I thought the waiters would come by 
any minute and flame it for dessert. Better is caldereta, a spicy beef 
preparation from the little known Philippine province of Pampanga. It's a dish 
that doesn't seem Asian at all -- the beef is covered with a thick blanket of 
sauce made from duck liver paste. I pegged it as a French-Yiddish-Hungarian 
concoction, but the chef assured me it was purely Pampangan. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland crab cakes with a Mornay sauce on the side aren't bad at all. But 
lengua estofado -- sliced ox tongue in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and 
olives -- was a big disappointment. It was somewhat salty and hockey-puck 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
All the old-time hotel desserts are served at Calesa: crepe suzette, baked 
Alaska, flaming fruit jubilee. You can also get a Filipino meringue confection 
with several layers of butter cream that taste sort of like silly putty. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $5 to $6.50. Filipino dishes are 
$12 to $16. House specialties are $12 to $18. The paellas (for two only) are 
$27.50 and $30.50.
