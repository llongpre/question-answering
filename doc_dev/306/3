   President Bush's new defense budget doesn't
offer a long-range vision for the Pentagon in a time of
revolutionary change, but it gives some short-term clues about how
this commander-in-chief wants the military to prepare for the years
to come.
   Bush said his $292.1 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a
chance to ``restructure America's defenses'' in the wake of
Europe's revolutionary changes, and he made headlines with last
week's proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of U.S. and Soviet
troops from the European continent.
   But the budget proposal also reveals a conservative,
take-it-slow approach in many areas.
   The 1991 plan takes only tentative steps into a new era with a
modest troop reduction of 38,000 in the coming year, cutbacks in
about 20 minor conventional weapon programs, and continued funding
for several futuristic weapons systems from the Reagan
administration, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative.

   On the eve of his 79th birthday and a year
after leaving the White House, former President Reagan says he's
keeping in shape by pumping iron daily and trimming trees with a
chain saw.
   Reagan remains busy on the speaking circuit, delivering speeches
on issues dear to him, such as a balanced budget amendment and
line-item veto power for the president in dealing with budget
issues.
   Reagan, whose birthday is Tuesday, has embraced an active
retirement, saying he loves his return to California.
   ``I've always said that a Californian who is forced to live away
from California lives in a state of perpetual homesickness,'' he
said, adding, ``It isn't a place, it's a way of life.''

   The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest
death rate in crashes, while a four-door Volvo has the lowest,
according to a study released today.
   The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car
wrecks for every 10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United
States. It also found the Volvo 740-760 four-door had the lowest
rate, 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles.
   The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were
released by the Michigan Association of Professional Insurance
Agents.
   ``Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival
when driving a larger vehicle,'' said James Alexander, president of
the Michigan association.

   Forty years after a copy writer for a small
advertising agency took a taffy-like substance invented by accident
and called it Silly Putty, the toy in the plastic egg is still
making an impression.
   Binney &amp; Smith Inc., Silly Putty's maker, sells more than 3
million eggs a year of the bounceable, moldable, stretchable toy
capable of lifting images from newspapers.
   And this spring, the Easton-based company plans to add four
fluorescent colors of Silly Putty to the pinkish silicone rubber.
   These colors mark the first change in the product since Peter C.
Hodgson borrowed $147 in 1950 to market a researcher's failed
attempt at making synthetic rubber during World War II.
