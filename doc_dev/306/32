news conference at Willard Park, near People's Park, Paul Sawyer decried what
he said was the university's lack of compassion for the homeless.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Helmeted riot police fired putty pellets for the second night in a row to
break up demonstrators at People's Park late Friday.;    The action came after
scores of officers had surrounded about a hundred protesters near the
University of California campus as demonstrations over the fate of the park
continued for a third night.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That group had peacefully dispersed but regrouped about 11:30 at the park,
a few blocks south. After a garbage can was set on fire and some rocks were
thrown at police, riot squads tore through the park, chasing everyone out.;   
Through most of the evening, the situation had been far more peaceful than the
previous two nights, when protesters set bonfires, smashed store windows and
threw bottles and rocks at police.;    The protesters are seeking to block the
university from building volleyball courts and other facilities on the park, a
few blocks south of campus. Control over the park sparked a major riot in
1969.;    Marchers began attempting to roam the streets of the city again at 9
p.m. but police restricted them to a five-block area between the park and
campus, refusing to let them drift into business districts.;    At 10:30 p.m.,
most of the crowd had been moved into a block-long section of Bancroft Avenue
near Boalt Hall, the university's law school. Police then told the
demonstrators they should leave in small groups or be arrested. Slowly, the
crowd began to disperse.;    Earlier Friday, one People's Park supporter
thought the confrontation could soon resemble 1969's fatal battle over the
same piece of ground.;    "The university is the perpetrator of violence,"
said Paul Sawyer, a minister at the Berkeley Unitarian Universalist
Fellowship. "We're concerned someone will be dead by the weekend.";    Friday
night's incidents capped a day of finger-pointing and futile attempts to
defuse the situation.;    In separate news conferences, police and People's
Park protesters blamed each for the escalation in tension that led officers to
use putty and wooden bullets Thursday night on an unruly crowd.  </TEXT>
