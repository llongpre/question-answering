<LEADPARA>  In the high-stakes game of selecting where to put Santa Clara County's next
light-rail line, both competitors have their advantages:;    (check) Mountain
View has an appealing downtown -- complete with a spanking new performing arts
center -- to attract riders. Sunnyvale has only grandiose plans for one.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  2 CITIES BID TO BOARD LIGHT RAIL
HEARINGS DISCUSS ROUTE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) Sunnyvale is strategically located, making it easy to extend a
future light-rail line to Cupertino. Getting there from Mountain View would be
longer and costlier -- maybe $20 million costlier.;    Hearings help decide
issue;  This week, a series of three public hearings on where the line goes
next will help determine who will be the winner of what is known as the Tasman
Corridor extension.;    "It's pretty close," said San Jose City Councilman Jim
Beall, who serves on the Tasman Corridor policy subcommittee, which will play
a major role in selecting the line's terminus. The corridor runs from Milpitas
in the east to Mountain View in the northwest.;    "It's a very hard choice,"
echoed Santa Clara Mayor Sue Lasher, who also has a vote.;    The stakes are
high enough that each city has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on
public relations and consultants. Though Sunnyvale has a larger population and
employment base, Mountain View is denser, with a true downtown. Both offer
stations within a quarter-mile walking distance of about 70,000 people.;   
Final choice likely by July 23;  The winner must be decided by July 18; on
July 23, the county board of supervisors, acting as the Transit Board, in all
likelihood will rubber-stamp the subcommittee's decision.;    So far, no one
is predicting the outcome. Of the eight officials on the subcommittee, two are
clearly for Sunnyvale -- Supervisor Ron Gonzales, whose district includes
Sunnyvale, and Sunnyvale Councilman Larry Stone -- and two are leaning toward
Mountain View -- Supervisor Dianne McKenna, whose district includes Mountain
View, and Mountain View Mayor Art Takahara. The other four -- Supervisor Rod
Diridon, Milpitas Vice-Mayor Jim Lawson, Beall and Lasher -- say they are
undecided.;    One reason for the waffling is that the project's "numbers" are
like Silly Putty, and numbers -- such as which route would pull in the most
new transit riders at the lowest cost -- are what most say the decision should
be based on.;    Cost estimates vary; The line from Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space
Co. to downtown Sunnyvale could cost $66 million, for instance. Or $105
million. From Lockheed to downtown Mountain View could cost $75 million. Or
$93 million. Even the ridership figures in the draft environmental impact
report -- currently projecting the Mountain View option to attract about 500
more daily riders -- are subject to change.;    "If you build a big high-rise
building (near one line), things can change," said Beall. "Who knows what they
can be.";    Since the cost estimates do not make the choice obvious,
officials are developing their own set of criteria.;    Sweetening the deal; 
Diridon and Beall want to see how hard each city's politicians are willing to
publicly lobby for an extension of the county's half-cent sales tax. Diridon
also wants to know if either one is willing to make a cash contribution to
sweeten to deal.;    "If one of the cities were to step forward and say 'We'll
give you $20 million,' that would be important," said Diridon.;    Mountain
View, which just completed a performing arts and city hall complex, has no
extra cash. But Sunnyvale has indicated it might be willing to contribute $15
million toward the project if it goes to Sunnyvale and runs down Pastoria
Avenue rather than Mathilda Avenue, said Stone.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
There will be three public hearings on the Tasman Corridor light rail
extension this week. The first will be at 7 p.m. today at Techmart, Suite 113,
5201 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara. The second hearing will be at 7 p.m.
Wednesday in the Berryessa School District Board Room, 1376 Piedmont Road, San
Jose. The third hearing is at 2 p.m. Thursday at the Santa Clara County
Transportation Agency, in the auditorium of Building 2, 1555 Berger Drive, San
Jose.  </TEXT>
