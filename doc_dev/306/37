   People were tied up in knots over Silly
String until the City Council banned its sale and use.
   But since that action Monday, police face the sticky question of
enforcing the prohibition against the plastic shot from a can.
   ``We have the discretion to enforce the law and we will use it,''
acting Police Chief Joseph Barry said Tuesday. ``We're not going to
go up to people and say, `This is a Silly String raid.'''
   Silly String became a problem at this year's Labor Day parade
when vendors sold it to young spectators.
   ``Every kid had a can of the stuff,'' Barry said. They sprayed
passing cars, pedestrians, fire trucks and anything else they could
think of, he said.
   ``The Department of Public Works had a horrendous time cleaning
it up,'' he said.
   Violators of the ban face a fine as high as $200.
   Many Marlboro stores stopped selling Silly String after Halloween.
   ``I have to wrestle with my conscience every time I sell it,''
said one vendor, who asked not to be identified. ``It's horrible.''
   Nathan Rossi, 15, disagreed. ``The stuff is awesome!'' he said.
   ``You sit there and spray people when they go by, '' said Rae
Campbell, 15. ``It's great.''
