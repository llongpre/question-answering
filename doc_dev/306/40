REMODELER'S DIARY: GETTING HOUSE IN SHAPE EARLY FOR RETIREMENT SALE

<P>
My husband and I were impelled into the wilderness of remodeling in the spring 
last year. The impetus was our 40-inch kitchen stove, which was about 30 years 
old. The stove was still doing its job, but it was beginning to show its age 
and couldn't bake a level cake. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get a new one," said my husband, Wil. 
</P>
<P>
The stove was built into custom cabinets, so we tried to buy another just like 
it but couldn't find a 40-inch stove of any kind. We knew that some major 
cabinet remodeling would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Refitting the cabinets to accommodate a new stove would also mean rebuilding 
the ceramic countertops, and we knew we couldn't match the existing tile. 
</P>
<P>
With only one of our five children still at home, with college costs almost out 
of the way and retirement plans to be considered, we agreed that any 
improvements to the house should add to its resale value. 
</P>
<P>
Another important consideration was that we wanted to enjoy the fruits of our 
labor for awhile instead of making improvements and redecorating when we were 
ready to sell. 
</P>
<P>
So we made a list of things we wanted to do. In fact, we made several lists, 
juggling needed repairs against desired improvements until we settled on a 
combination we could afford: refinishing floors upstairs and down, getting new 
carpeting, windows, doors and entry tile, plus the final decorator items -- 
paint, wallpaper, draperies, bed covers, area rugs and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted to lighten and brighten our home in every way possible. And we wanted 
to build an all-new kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
We estimated costs, arranged the financing and then had to decide where to 
begin. We made mistake No. 1 when we started with the flooring. 
</P>
<P>
We knew the other projects -- remodeling the kitchen, replacing entry tile, 
redecorating -- should be done first, but we expected house guests through the 
summer and didn't want to offer them rooms. We made mistake No. 2 when we 
contracted for the floor refinishing and carpeting with a man sent out to 
measure our rooms by a vendor preparing an estimate. This man said he could 
save us quite a bit of money, and we accepted his offer. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would take two weeks to re-glue and refinish wood parquet floors in 
the master bedroom and hallway, install new wood parquet in the den, refinish 
the hardwood floor in the dining room and install carpeting in three upstairs 
bedrooms and a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The day he was to start he called to say his truck had broken down. He began 
working two days later with a crew of young men who were neither careful nor 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
They used the wrong stain on the wood parquet, which then had to be sanded and 
stained again, and installed a different shade of carpet than we ordered 
(though, ultimately, it proved to be better for our color scheme). 
</P>
<P>
The two-week schedule became a two-month nightmare, and we learned all over 
again that you get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Before the flooring was finished, we had the putty replaced on all windows 
(instead of installing new ones). While that was going on, our first house 
guests arrived and, in the midst of a severe heat wave, we were awakened each 
morning at 7 to the sound of the glazers chipping out the old putty. 
</P>
<P>
Folding closet doors were replaced with sliding, mirrored doors in all bedrooms 
and a closet organizing system was installed in the master bedroom -- all 
without mishap or delay. 
</P>
<P>
We shopped for other items, including a garden window for the kitchen. While 
ordering the window, we struck gold. The salesperson we worked with asked if 
we'd thought about consulting a kitchen designer. She highly recommended a 
woman with whom she had studied. Sandra restored our faith in people and our 
own good judgment. She met with us, asked many questions, followed up with 
letters and phone calls, and when we decided to contract with her for 
professional plans, she went into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
She advised us on how to verify the licenses of all contractors and 
subcontractors; how to prepare for interim cooking and dining facilities; which 
contractors and subcontractors to schedule, in which order. 
</P>
<P>
She counseled us on the latest lighting options and provided information on 
where to shop for good buys in fixtures, lighting and flooring. 
</P>
<P>
She also gave us great advice on the new kitchen sink: "Find a model you like 
with drains at the back, not in the middle. That way, your garbage disposal and 
plumbing connections will be at the back and you'll have a lot more usable 
space under the sink." 
</P>
<P>
When we ordered the cabinets at the end of October, we had to decide whether to 
begin construction as soon as the cabinets were delivered or wait until after 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractors said they could do the job in two or three weeks -- four at 
the most. Our designer said we'd be lucky to be back in the kitchen in less 
than six to eight weeks. We listened to her. It's a good thing we did, because 
demolition began on Jan. 9 this year, and we couldn't cook (let alone eat) in 
the kitchen again until Feb. 20 -- six weeks to the day. 
</P>
<P>
One subcontractor caused the delay. In dealing with him, we made Mistake No. 3 
-- which was to pay him for work not yet done. We learned that we must never do 
that for any reason. A reputable, responsible contractor or subcontractor has 
established credit with suppliers and enough capital reserve to expect payment 
only when the work has been done in an acceptable manner. 
</P>
<P>
While the final work was being done on the kitchen, we began scheduling the 
last of the remodeling and decorating, including some additional electrical 
work, exterior and interior doors, entry tile, ceiling fans in the bedrooms, 
wallpapering, and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Each time one of these projects was delayed (and most of them were), it meant 
rescheduling the workmen who were to follow. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was finally finished nine months after it began, and the results 
have made every minute of frustration and difficulty worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Our home has the bright, cheerful appearance we envisioned. The new kitchen is 
much more efficient and comfortable, with all-adjustable shelving, all base 
cabinets equipped with pull-out shelves or drawers, and a cabinet finish that 
is easily cleaned with cool water and a dry cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The entry is brighter and more welcoming, bedrooms appear larger and are easily 
cooled after a hot day, and the slightly imperfect flooring is easily 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
We can enjoy the results of this odyssey until we're ready to retire and sell. 
Then, whether we build our retirement home or buy one that needs remodeling, 
the first person we'll contact is Sandra.
