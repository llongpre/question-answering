<LEADPARA>  Q My small dinette area is paneled in unfinished pine barnboard. The kitchen
wainscoting is also barnboard. I would like to stain it light, but the Early
American stain I tried on a scrap piece of wood is too dark. Can I dilute the
stain to make it lighter? How can I get a light stain? -- M.S., Millis, Mass.;
   A Thinning down the Early American stain, which is fairly dark brown in the
first place, may work, but it's a matter of experimenting, trying a diluted
stain first and then diluting it more to make it lighter if necessary.
Diluting the stain will not change the color but will change the intensity of
the color, so it's worth a try. But for a light stain, try a beige stain or
keep trying with other light-colored stains until you find what you like. To
keep the stained wood from getting dirty (a stained surface is difficult to
clean), apply one or two coats of a flat (if you can find it) or semigloss
urethane varnish. You could also try the varnish directly on the unstained
wood; varnished pine often comes out a yellowish color that you might or might
not like.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q My finished basement floor got wet and the carpeting was soaked so badly
that I have to chuck it. I'd like to put down a vinyl tile, but a tile man
said that the peel-and-stick tiles won't work. Another tile man said that
industrial weight tiles with an adhesive would work. Now what? -- C.R.,
Franklin, Mass.;    A If the floor is rough, the peel-and-stick tiles won't
work because the thin tiles will follow the contours of the rough floor. If
the floor is very smooth, the peel-and-sticks should work. Heavy-duty tiles
put down with a waterproof adhesive will work well for a number of years. The
trouble with resilient tiles on a concrete floor is that water vapor comes up
through the concrete and tends to push the tiles right off. It might take
years before this happens.;    Q In my rented apartment, I suspect there is
some matchstick wainscoting in the kitchen behind some awful looking
wood-grain paneling. Can I take it off and paint the matchstick stuff if the
landlord approves? I think the paneling is nailed because I can see small
nails in the grooves. -- B. S., Belmont, Mass.;    A You can, but there are
several caveats to consider before trying it. If the paneling is glued on (and
sometimes it is glued as well as nailed), it can be pried off, but you would
be hard put to scrape or sand off the glue that remains. So, if it is glued,
don't take if off. If it is nailed, you should be able to pry it off and, if
the matchstick panels are intact, paint them. To find out, pry back a little
paneling at the top edge; prying back should indicate that it is glued or
nailed. If it is glued, you can put the paneling back without making a mess.
Since it is applied over wood boards (the matchstick), I would guess it is
only nailed.;    Q I am stripping wallpaper from plaster. Is it necessary to
remove all the remaining glue before painting? -- D. M., Quincy, Mass.;    A
Yes. Wash the walls with Spic and Span and water. If the glue doesn't wash off
completely, it should be soft enough that you can scrape if off with a wide
putty knife. After washing and scraping, let dry, and sand glue residue with
fine sandpaper. Then paint with two coats of a latex wall paint.;    Q I had a
maple table stripped, and finished it on the top with polyurethane varnish.
Now, after some years, the solid top, 3 by 5 feet, is warping. It never did
this before. I put it on its back, and some of the warp went away. --N.C.,
Lexington, Mass.;    A Solid wood table tops tend to warp no matter what you
try to do, because they are solid, and when they dry out, they shrink, causing
the warp. The fact that just the top was varnished may be contributing to the
warp, although it is doubtful that the bottom was ever varnished. First, check
to make sure that the screws holding the top to the apron under the top are
holding properly. If they are not, tightening them might straighten out the
warp. Turn the table over and set it on its top (on a rug or other soft, flat
surface). Place buckets of water on the top to try to bend it in the opposite
direction of the warp. Leave for days or weeks. If you do this in the winter,
when the wood is dry, it might work. When the top is flat again, apply two
coats of high-gloss urethane varnish to the bottom.  </TEXT>
