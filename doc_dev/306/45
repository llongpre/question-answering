<LEADPARA>  WHY would these distinguished children's authors get the idea that children
want to read about cleaning up?;   Perhaps it's good marketing. Children
seldom buy their own picture books. Order and cleanliness are adult
preoccupations. Would the children in Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" have
been so concerned about the Cat's frolicking devastation if their mother were
not coming back? The messiness inherent in being a child and the adult desire
to keep it tidy account for much of the daily stress of family life. (I also
suspect that children's book illustrators love the prospect of illustrating
chaos.)  </LEADPARA>

THREE NEW PICTURE BOOKS FIND THE NEATEST STORIES

<TEXT>     Of these three "mess" books, I think most children would pick "Fritz."
Rosemary Wells' plump animal characters with droll faces are always charmingly
dressed. I couldn't decide if Fritz and family are skunks or badgers. Never
mind. Fritz has the kind of room most children love. His favorite things are
Scotch-taped to the ceiling willy-nilly. The floor is littered with clothes,
toys, books, caps, ice-cream spoons stuck to dessert plates and an uneaten
peanut butter sandwich.;   On hearing the incessant parental litany, "Cleaned
up your room yet, Fritz?" Fritz agreeably shovels the stuff under his bed and
heads to the dinner table, where he endures his prissy sister Tiffany's
superiority and taints his milk with pickle relish so he won't have to drink
it. After picking raisins out of his toast and stashing most of his potatoes
under his seat cushion, Fritz doesn't quibble about doing the dishes. He does,
however, get distracted by the need to select and assemble a last-minute
science project. Fritz selects one that requires a raw egg, a feather, copper
wire, rose-water glycerin (from Tiffany's dressing table, natch) and a junior
rocket booster.;   Fritz is a single-minded scientist, oblivious to the dishes
he's left in the sink and the mess he's making. When confronted by all three
family members, he denies any responsibility, slams his bedroom door and
angrily punishes himself by throwing all of his trucks out the window into the
garden. He then falls into an exhausted sleep.;   The science experiment on
the floor beside his bed performs a once-in-a-lifetime chemical change,
producing a big pink Mess Fairy, a sort of Cat-in-the-Hat derivative who makes
Fritz look like a neatnik. Fritz watches in horror as the Mess Fairy snarls
extension cords, drinks lemonade from 23 glasses and mixes up board-game
pieces. He manages to banish her by reversing his rocket engine, but her
memory is so overwhelming that Fritz snuggles into the warmth and security of
his parents' bed. Oh, such cuddly, reassuring parents Wells' provides. "Did
you have a bad dream, my little carrot cake?" whispers the mother. "We love
you, Son," murmurs the father.;   Surrounded by such affection, Fritz is
suddenly ashamed of the mess he's left. He attacks the cluttered house with
resolve, and by dawn, "he feels good and clean and neat." Still euphoric about
his loving family, he determines to make them breakfasts in bed and, you
guessed it, cheerfully wrecks the kitchen while viewing himself as "the new
Fritz.";   Wells amuses children while offering wisdom to harried parents.
Children do not see clutter the way we do. The beads stuck in the clay are not
beads. They're berries. The sandwich under the bed may appease a dragon
lurking in the closet. Order is always temporary in childhood, perhaps
throughout life. Love must be forever.;   I have ambivalent feelings about
gorgeous, artistically exquisite, expensive picture books such as "Pish, Posh,
Said Hieronymous Bosch." On one hand, I favor exposing children to as much
visually stimulating color and line as possible. On the other hand, I thought
it was a pretentious ego-trip for parents when my own children studied
Michelangelo by lying on their backs painting under the nursery-school tables
a la the Sistine Chapel. I'm similarly unimpressed when a 4-year-old compares
her splatter painting to works of Jackson Pollock. Kindergartens should not
serve Perrier and Brie for snacks.;   Now comes Nancy Willard, who made
children conversant with William Blake ("A Visit to William Blake's Inn")
several years ago, to introduce the wee ones to the 16th-century painter
Hieronymous Bosch, a fantasist known for painting mysteriously tormented
creatures often with vegetable or bestial parts where heads and arms should
be.;   Willard dedicates this book to "James and Julie," who I presume are
children. The illustrators -- the much-honored Leo and Diane Dillon, working
here with their son, Lee -- are cagier about their market. Their dedication is
"To wives and housekeepers and mothers everywhere." I wouldn't let a
runny-nosed, grubby-fisted kid anywhere near this creamy paper with the
three-shaded, hand-lettered text. The illustrations, according to the
copyright page, were under-painted in acrylics on acetate, over-painted with
oils, spot-; varnished and printed on 100-pound Natural Karma paper. The frame
on each page was sculpted and cast in silver, bronze and brass, then assembled
on a wood frame and photographed. Like a collectible bisque doll, this book
would remain on a high shelf to be brought down perhaps once a year for a
closely supervised look-see.;   Like the title, the text is satisfying end
rhyming. Bosch's housekeeper, a remarkably patient and tolerant woman, is
finally fed up with trying to bring order to the bizarre artist's household:; 
 "I'm quitting your service, I've had quite enough;   of your three-legged
thistles asleep in my wash,;   Of scrubbing the millstone you use for a dish,;
  and riding to shops on a; pickle-winged fish.";   "Pish, Posh,";   said
Hieronymus Bosch.;    The housekeeper thinks she'd much prefer the quiet
ordered life of working for nuns in a convent to "wrestling with dragons to
get to my sink / while the cats chase the cucumbers, slickity-slink." She
packs her suitcase and departs. While she sleeps, her suitcase yawns and
unleashes an eerie, yet affectionate assortment of stowaway Bosch-type
critters: a mole in a habit, a thistledown rabbit, a troop of jackdaws and a
three-legged dish. The text takes a dark turn as the housekeeper says:;   
They're not what I wished for. When women are young;   they want curly-haired
daughters and raven-haired sons.;   In this vale of tears we must take what
we're sent,;   Feathery, leathery, lovely, or bent.;    Resigned to her fate,
the housekeeper returns, and the childlike artist Bosch, with a colander on
his head, crows with delight. He greets her as his "Salvation" with great
affection and wacky promises of reform. Like most wives, mothers and all
housekeepers, we know it's only temporary.;   Despite the bizarre creatures
that populate each page, the Dillons have not drawn a nightmare-inducer. In
fact, their footed beehives and broom-bottomed mantises recalled a game that
once kept me entertained during interminable church services. My mother would
draw the head of some creature, fold the paper and invite me to draw any sort
of torso without knowing what sort of head she'd supplied. When I'd folded my
portion, another child in the pew might be invited to supply the legs and
another the feet. We were always delighted with the unfolding. Would it have
been any better if we could have exclaimed, "How Boschian!"?;   Messes made by
children and imaginative artists are fair game for children's books, but what
of the messes made by angry adults? In "Alpha and the Dirty Baby," Alpha, who
looks to be about 7, observes her parents swapping angry words and making
careless threats. The self-pitying, childish father says, "Oh, yes, they'd be
sorry if I joined the navy and got drowned." A devil's imp overhears and
transforms him into a lump of coal. The aloof mother remarks, "If that fool
does join the navy and gets drowned, I won't care." The imp's wife transforms
her into a green egg. The imps appropriate the parents' clothes and with putty
faces pretend to be Alpha's parents. If that weren't horrifying enough, they
thrust a filthy baby sister at Alpha with instructions to "Hug it! Kiss it!
Love it up!";   With the devilish imps in charge, Alpha's life is totally
disordered. They are slobs who insist that the garbage be brought in, not out,
that beds be unmade, not made. The dirty baby tattles every time Alpha tries
to clean up. Lolling in their upstairs bed, the disheveled imp/parents hurl
threats at Alpha, "You'd better stop that, Alpha, or you're going to get it!";
  Soap and water to the rescue. Alpha triumphs by holding the dirty baby
hostage in the bathtub, which the imps won't touch for fear of getting their
hands clean. To retrieve their dirty baby, the imps agree to restore Alpha's
parents, a feat achieved by tossing the lump of coal and the green egg in the
soapy bathwater. The imps depart and Alpha stands, arms folded, a world-weary
little girl; her parents embrace, still standing in the bathtub.;   The
watercolor illustrations are lovely; nobody creates a flurry of gorgeous
disarray better than Brock Cole, the author and illustrator of such charming
books as "The Giant's Toe" and "The King at the Door." This book, however, has
a story line as dark as his young-adult novels ("The Goats" and "Celine"). It
seems to exploit a child's worst fears: that one's parents' angry words will
cause a cataclysm, that parents might just disappear, that strangers who
resemble one's parents might assume their role, that a filthy baby intruder
might transform the whole family beyond recognition, and finally, that the
child herself or himself might have to assume the responsibility abdicated by
the adults.;   On the other hand, if this is just a story about the wonderful
powers of soap and water, I can think of better ways to get a kid to take a
bath. (box)  </TEXT>
