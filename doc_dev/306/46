   Why does a shade of dusky crimson in Benjamin Moore &amp;
Co.'s current paint catalog bear the name Segovia Red?
Because the World's Fair is drawing attention to Spain?
Absolutely. Because Spain produces hearty red wines? Yes.
Because Segovia is the name of Kenneth Charbonneau's wife?
Maybe that, too.
   After all, Mr. Charbonneau, paint-nomenclature manager at
the nation's fourth-largest paint maker, is entitled to take
a liberty now and again. He's responsible for all 2,000 hues
on the Montvale, N.J., company's palette, and most of them
must be renamed -- euphoniously, fashionably -- every six to
eight years. When he goes to the movies, watches television
or flips through a mail-order catalog, he is thinking about
the nation's mood and how it may be expressed in paint.

   He has to know when to stop selling Tequila Sunrise,
Yellow Submarine and Magic Dragon and start selling Mesquite,
Rainforest and Rolled Oats. Ivory sounded elegant and
romantic until the early '80s, when it suddenly suggested
dead elephants; renamed Oriental Silk, its sales jumped.
Tobacco Brown is still in the catalog, but Mr. Charbonneau
concedes "its name is a little unfortunate these days."
   Mr. Charbonneau worked as a painter and graphic designer
before joining Benjamin Moore in 1967 as an illustrator. For
the past 19 years, his title has been color and merchandising
manager. An animated 53-year-old, he lives in a house named
Beau Geste and oversees a staff of six color developers from
a corner office done in Abingdon Putty (light green, about
the color of a margarita).
   Right now, with international news in the air, he favors a
foreign flavor: Majorca Peach, Bordeaux Rose, Dresden Blue. A
new favorite is a deep magenta he christened Caravaggio Red.
"We could have called it Picasso Red, but that would have
been brighter, more vibrant, more shocking, a little more
orange," he says.
   With the World's Fair and the Barcelona Olympics just over
the horizon, he's considering Toreador Red and Flamenco
Orange. For some reason, fruits and vegetables are on his
mind: Bitter Chocolate is now Raisin. And for the politically
minded, there's a Kennebunkport Green.
   Once in a while, a name just walks into his office --
literally. Mr. Charbonneau recalls: "I had all these colors
in front of me one day, and in walked a colleague wearing a
new grey-colored suit . . . and there it was." Grey Flannel.
