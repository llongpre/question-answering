<LEADPARA>  EXTERIOR house paint is now less toxic and less harmful to the environment
than it was. It is also easier to apply. But for paint to live up to
manufacturers' claims for durability and long life, surfaces to be painted
must be carefully prepared.;    Preparing outdoor surfaces for painting is
often the most difficult and tedious part of a painting project; it can also
pose a health hazard if the existing paint contains lead.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here are methods for preparing exterior surfaces found on most houses.;   
(check) Unpainted wood needs only an undercoating of primer. Use the type
recommended on the label of the paint to be applied.;    (check) To prepare
painted wood, find out first whether the existing paint contains lead. The
federal government banned the use of lead-based paint in housing in 1978, but
all houses with paint applied before 1980 should be considered at risk.;   
The only way to determine whether paint contains lead is to have the paint
tested. Local policies and services regarding lead testing vary; for
information, contact your state or local health department or a lead-poisoning
control center.;    If the paint contains lead, the wisest plan is to have the
surface professionally stripped by a contractor specializing in this.;    If
the paint does not contain lead, remove all loose particles with a scraper or
by sanding, and sand shiny but sound paint to roughen the surface so that new
paint will adhere tightly.;    Thick layers of paint should also be scraped
off.;    To soften these, use a heat gun resembling a hair dryer. Do not allow
paint to smolder, which can cause harmful fumes. Also avoid using a torch; its
open flame can start a fire.;    Excessive blistering or peeling, particularly
if it exposes bare wood, often is a signal that there are indoor condensation
problems.;    These can usually be cured by reducing the level of household
moisture, installing a vapor barrier of plastic sheeting or painting the
inside walls with special vapor-barrier paint and increasing ventilation by
using exhaust fans.;    After removing loose particles or if the paint is
sound, wash the surfaces to remove dirt and powdery paint residue. Both
prevent new paint from bonding tightly with old and as a result, the new paint
may fall off when the paint weathers a bit.;    Use household detergent mixed
with water according to the manufacturer's instructions. If surfaces have
mildew on them, add a cup of borax per gallon of water to the solution, or
separately apply a liquid mildew remover containing bleach.;    In both cases,
wear goggles and rubber gloves for protection. Rinse washed surfaces with
plain water.;    Drive all protruding nails below the surface. Then fill the
depressions with waterproof putty. Replace old or crumbling caulking.;   
Cover stains and areas of paint that remain powdery even after washing by
applying a stain-blocking primer-sealer. Cover other bare spots with whatever
primer is recommended for the paint to be applied. If the new paint will be a
significantly different color, consider priming the entire surface.;   
(check) Aluminum siding can be painted. To prepare it, wash and rinse as if it
were wood. If the existing paint is flaking, sand or brush the surface with a
wire brush before washing.;    (check) Vinyl siding, too, can be painted with
reasonable success provided the new color will not be significantly darker
than the original. (Heat from the sun can warp dark siding.);    To prepare
vinyl siding, simply wash and rinse. Sanding or brushing is unnecessary and
will scratch the siding.;    (check) To prepare unpainted concrete, brick and
stucco, or if paint on these materials is sound, scrub the surfaces with a
wire brush to remove loose particles, then rinse by spraying with a garden
hose. Allow it to dry completely before applying paint.;    If the cement in
masonry is less than six months old, it is necessary to apply an undercoating
with alkali-resistant primer before painting.;    To remove flaking paint from
concrete brick and stucco, use the same procedures as above but have the paint
tested for lead first.;    After removing the paint from surfaces in poor
condition, coat them with masonry conditioner. Some conditioners can be mixed
with paint.;    (check) Metal gutters and downspouts that may be coated with
lead paint should be tested and professionally stripped, if necessary.;    If
the paint is free of lead, these items can be prepared for new paint simply by
scouring their surfaces with a wire brush and applying rust-resistant primer.
Rust spots should be sanded down to bare metal or treated with rust converter
before primer is applied.;    Primer is not needed on galvanized metal that is
in good condition. But new, unpainted galvanized surfaces should be washed
with detergent to remove oils left on them from the galvanizing process.;   
Afterward, rinse the surfaces with water and allow them to dry before applying
paint.  </TEXT>
