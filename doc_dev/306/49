Mrs. H. S. Weir of Laguna Hills would like to find a bead-restringing kit for 
her Venetian-glass and other costume-variety jewelry. Can you help with a few 
pearls of wisdom, or will she feel she's being strung along because nobody 
wants to draw a bead on a source?

Because of a medical problem, Alice Zrodlo of Valencia needs old-formula 
Questran, as made by Mead Johnson. The changed medication, now manufactured 
elsewhere, does not seem to do the job as well. Can you spell relief the old 
way for Zrodlo, or perhaps even come up with the name of a laboratory that will 
make the formulation, or will Zrodlo just have to grin and bear it?

Ann Shelton of Arleta cannot get her hands on Plasti-Tak, a reusable adhesive 
that's used like putty and was manufactured by Brooks Manufacturing Co. of 
Ohio; you roll it into a ball and press it between surfaces that you want to 
join together. (If it's no longer on the market, she'll settle for something 
similar.) Can you help without pressing the issue too hard, or will Shelton not 
have a ball until she puts the squeeze on another manufacturer?

Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Mrs. Witman at (714) 984-7220 needs a Marsh Farms 
Mini Incubator Model TX6 for hatching desert tortoise eggs; the company seems 
to have moved. Please help before these tortoises take their place in the 
pecking order, or else Witman will know she's laid an egg. . . . Speaking of 
deserts, Claire at (619) 347-8656 wants a copy of "Desert, the American 
Southwest," by Ruth Kirk, which has long been out of print. Please see to it 
that Claire gets her just desert. . . . Frances at (818) 344-3685 needs several 
Melmac dinner plates; because these are her everyday dishes, almost any pattern 
will do. Because Frances is hungry for information, let this request be food 
for thought. . . . Priscilla at (213) 863-3508 needs five books of Green Stamps 
and is willing to exchange Blue Chip stamps for them. Please do something 
colorful for Priscilla as soon as you've read this.
