   Police say they will enforce the law no
matter how sticky the problem.
   They're up against liquid plastic shot from a can that's meant to
entertain youngsters, but the City Council wasn't laughing and
decided to ban the yucky stuff.
   ``We have the discretion to enforce the law and we will use it,''
Acting Police Chief Joseph Barry said Tuesday. ``We're not going to
go up to people and say, `This is a Silly String raid.'''
   The council banned the sale and use of Silly String on Monday.
   Silly String became a problem at this year's Labor Day parade
when vendors sold it to young spectators.
   ``Every kid had a can of the stuff,'' Barry said. They sprayed
passing cars, pedestrians, fire trucks and anything else they could
think of, he said.
   ``The Department of Public Works had a horrendous time cleaning
it up,'' he said.
   Violators of the ban face a fine as high as $200.
   Many Marlboro stores stopped selling Silly String after Halloween.
   ``I have to wrestle with my conscience every time I sell it,''
said one vendor, who asked not to be identified. ``It's horrible.''
The runny plastic has no known practical application other than the
amusement of young minds.
   ``The stuff is awesome!'' said Nathan Rossi, 15.
   ``You sit there and spray people when they go by,'' said Rae
Campbell, 15. ``It's great.''

   Talk of a high-tech radar system that
snaps a picture of the license plates of speeding cars and then
allows Connecticut police to send tickets in the mail is just that _
talk, say police.
   Rumors that state police were using the devices in 18 locations
around the state prompted a Waterbury-based insurance agency to send
out hundreds of letters to its clients last month, warning them to
slow down.
   ``It's absolutely not true,'' said Sgt. Robert Slattery, a state
police spokesman. ``If we had that we would publicize it. We don't
sneak up on the public with something like that.''
   Slattery said that although such a device is used in other states
and in Germany, it could not be used in Connecticut.
   ``The way the law was written, the owners aren't responsible for
speeding like they are for evading responsibility,'' Slattery said.
   However, Richard Bozzuto of BSD Insurance in Waterbury, a former
state senator, said he heard from ``a very good source'' that the
radar devices were going to be set up at 18 locations on state roads.
   On Oct. 6, Bozzuto sent 400 to 500 letters to clients warning
them that the devices ``will operate 24 hours at day, take a
photograph of your car and send the infraction notice directly to
your home via U.S. mail.''
   ``We sent it to clients to warn them. Insurance rates are
certainly dependent on driving records,'' Bozzuto said. ``The more
violations and convictions, the higher the rates are.''
   Joseph Santaniello, a state Department of Transportation traffic
engineer, said the department does have monitoring devices in 25
places across the state. The department compiles the data for
federal funding programs under which the average speed for 50
percent of the vehicles must be 55 mph or less.
   Santantiello said the devices are not used as law enforcement
tools.
