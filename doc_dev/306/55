<LEADPARA>  WAINSCOTING is wood paneling used to cover the lower portions of walls from
the floor level usually to a height of about three feet.;    Wainscoting is
sturdier and less susceptible to staining than paint or wallpaper; therefore,
it better withstands rubbing by furniture and is easier to clean.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But wainscoting has an aesthetic value as well. It can add elegance to a
den and charm to a kitchen or dining room.;    Wainscoting kits usually
include solid pine or cedar tongue-and-groove boards 32 inches long, about 3
1/2 inches wide and 1/516 inch thick.;    The boards interlock side by side
and are meant to be attached vertically. Where the boards meet, their edges
are either rounded and grooved to form a narrow bead or tapered to form a V.; 
  Both styles come with horizontal baseboard and chair-rail molding that is
notched on the back to cover the ends of the vertical boards. When assembled
from some kits, the height of the wainscoting is 35 1/2 inches.;    The
contents of a single kit will cover about five linear feet. Depending on the
dealer, pine wainscoting costs about $18 to $25 and cedar about $25 to $40.;  
 Wainscoting can be attached directly to wallboard or plaster walls if the
surface is reasonably flat. Over masonry walls or bare studs, nail horizontal
strips of 1-by-3 lumber (called furring strips) at 16-inch intervals and
around the perimeter of the area to provide support and a suitable fastening
surface.;    Before installing wainscoting, unpack it and let it adjust for
about 48 hours to temperature and humidity.;    On a finished wall, begin
installation by prying away the baseboard molding and discarding it.;    Next,
cut the new baseboard molding to length. If wainscoting is to be installed on
adjacent walls, cut all of the baseboard molding first, mitering or coping the
ends where they meet.;    For mitering -- cutting the ends of the molding at a
45-degree angle -- use a miter box and back saw, or rent a power miter saw,
also called a chop saw.;    Coping involves cutting the end of one piece so it
fits over the front of another piece at a right angle.;    Miter the end of
the piece to reveal the molding's profile, then saw the mitered part off
squarely, using a coping saw to follow the profile's contours. When finished,
the coped piece should fit precisely against the other piece, whose end is
left square.;    Mark the height of the chair-rail molding on the wall, then
cut these pieces to length and miter or cope them if necessary. Identify all
pieces on the back so they can be reassembled exactly.;    Apply finish to
wainscoting before installing it; otherwise, unfinished portions may show if
the vertical boards later shrink.;    If paint is to be used, sand with
150-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit, and coat the wood with primer and one
coat of paint.;    After installation, apply a second coat. If a natural
finish is planned, sand as described and coat the wood with penetrating
sealer.;    Then apply stain if desired, followed by either a penetrating
finish (some of these contain stain) or a single coat of surface finish like
polyurethane. Coat the edges of boards as well as the side that will be
visible.;    When the finish is dry, nail the baseboard lightly into place
with annular-ring paneling nails about 1 1/2 inches long. Supplement these
with construction adhesive if desired.;    Start applying the wainscoting at
the more difficult corner so that the last board will fit in easily. If the
adjacent wall will receive wainscoting also, simply place the first board's
tongued edge against the inside of the corner so that the grooved edge can
receive the next board, and so on.;    Hold a carpenter's level against the
grooved edge and adjust the board until it is vertical.;    If the walls are
not straight, causing the tongued edge of the board to slant more than a
quarter of an inch away from the inside of the corner, set the arms of a
drawing compass to the widest space between board and the corner.;    Then, by
holding the pointed arm against the corner and sliding the compass up or down,
scribe the surface of the board with the arm containing the pencil.;    Trim
the board with a saw or plane to the scribed line; the board should then fit
perfectly against the corner.;    This process should also be performed if the
adjacent wall is not to receive wainscoting; if the walls are straight, you
need merely remove the tongue of the board with a plane.;    Fasten the board
to the wall at 16-inch intervals with the same nails used for the molding and
with construction adhesive if desired.;    Install the remaining boards the
same way. Drive the nails at an angle to the wall for maximum holding power.
When nailing into a V-groove, drive the nail into one side of the groove, not
into the center. Scribe and cut the grooved edge of the final board to fit by
following the instructions for the first board.;    After the vertical boards
are in place, fit the chair-rail molding over their tops and nail it to the
wall, using adhesive also if desired.;    Then drive all nails below the
surface with a nail set, fill the depressions above the nail heads with putty,
and either touch these up with penetrating finish or apply the final coat of
paint or surface finish to the wainscoting as directed earlier.  </TEXT>
