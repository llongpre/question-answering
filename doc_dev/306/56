Any wood door with a plain, flat face can quickly and easily be given a whole 
new look through the application of moldings. Almost any lumber yard or 
hardware store carries a large selection of inexpensive stock molding patterns 
that will suit any taste, and you can combine moldings for even more pattern 
possibilities. The look you choose is limited only by your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by studying some of the designs shown here, suggested by the Wood 
Moulding and Millwork Producers Assn. You might also want to examine actual 
doors, either in magazines and catalogues or by driving around your 
neighborhood, to get an idea of what look you'd like to achieve. You can then 
try a few sketches and experiment with different patterns. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the lumber yard is next. They'll have a molding chart or a sample 
board that you can look at, which will show you what patterns are available and 
what their actual sizes are. You may wish to use only one design, or you may 
choose to combine two or more of them into other patterns. When actually 
purchasing your moldings, first determine how many feet you'll need, then add 
about 20% for waste at the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
You will find it easiest to work on the door if it is taken off its hinges and 
laid flat on a pair of sawhorses. Simply remove the hinge pins, then have 
someone help you slip the door out of the frame. Exterior doors are very heavy 
and awkward, so be sure you have help. 
</P>
<P>
With a pencil, a straightedge and a framing square, measure and lay out your 
design directly on the door. This will let you further experiment with the 
design and modify it as desired. When you have it exactly as you'd like it, the 
drawn-out design can serve as a pattern for cutting the moldings. 
</P>
<P>
You will need a miter box to accurately and cleanly cut the moldings. If you 
only have a few cuts to make, you may wish to purchase an inexpensive miter box 
that can be used with any type of hand saw. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of moldings to install or if the cuts are at angles other 
than 45 to 90 degrees (the only cuts you can make on the inexpensive boxes), 
you may want to rent a professional-quality hand or electric miter box. 
</P>
<P>
Moldings that meet in a 90-degree corner, used when forming a square or 
rectangle, needed to be mitered at 45 degrees on each piece. To make an 
octagon, where the corners are each 45 degrees, the miters are cut a 22 1/2 
degrees each. Other angles can be made by simply measuring the desired angle 
with a common protractor, then cutting the miters at half that angle. 
</P>
<P>
Attach the moldings to the door with yellow woodworker's glue (lightly sand any 
glossily-painted surfaces first) and small brads. If the moldings are thin or 
if you're nailing near the ends, pre-drill the wood to prevent splitting. 
Finally, set the nail heads, fill the holes with wood putty or exterior 
spackle, and stain or paint the moldings to match the door.
