<LEADPARA>  Q I had a new oak threshold installed at my front door. The original was only
15 years old and rotted out. Can I put urethane varnish on it to preserve it?
It's only five inches above the pavement in front of the door, and is exposed
to the weather.;    A Don't use varnish; it will not stand up outside. The
best and easiest treatment is to apply one or two coats of an oil-based
semitransparent preservative stain. Do the underside as well, where the
threshold juts out a bit. When the preservative begins to wear, just slap on
another coat. Another preservative method you could use is to apply a mixture
of one part boiled linseed oil and one part paint thinner. This will turn the
threshold very dark.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q My cedar closet is 8 years old and has lost its aroma. How can I restore
it?;    A Sand all exposed wood with a medium-fine sandpaper; that will expose
new wood and should produce more aroma.;    Q We installed new knotty pine in
our addition; it is tongued and grooved, but there are some nails showing
where they had to be nailed directly into the wood. How can I make those nails
disappear, and how can I keep the wood as light as possible? I heard an
acrylic clear spray will keep the wood light.;    A Countersink the nail heads
and fill them with a wood filler; this puttylike material is light beige in
color. Fill the nail holes and smooth off, trying to get as little filler as
possible on the wood. When it dries, sand off any excess. The clear acrylic
spray is worth using, although an aerosol spray is expensive for a whole room.
Practice first on a piece of scrap pine. Excessive spray or spraying too close
to the wood will cause wrinkling and dripping; too far away will not apply
enough spray. Two coats will probably be necessary. Semigloss urethane varnish
is acceptable, too, but may darken the wood more than the acrylic.;    Q I
have one coat of paint on a plasterboard dry wall in my condo. I want to put
up wallpaper. Is there anything that I have to do to the wall before putting
up the paper? I have heard that wallpaper is impossible to remove from
plasterboard.;    A You heard right. If paper is applied to bare plasterboard,
removing it is, indeed, impossible. The water or steam that softens the paste
behind the paper during removal also softens the paper facing of the
plasterboard, and scraping is sure to gouge it. The solution is to paint the
plasterboard with an oil-based primer; this waterproofs the plasterboard so
that it is unaffected by water or steam when the paper is removed. The one
coat on the plasterboard you have now is probably latex, so apply a coat of
oil-based wall paint or primer. Be sure to apply a glue size to the wall
before papering. The glue size will make the paper stick better and also make
it easier to remove. If the walls were plaster or skim-coated Blueboard (the
modern dry wall) there would be no need for priming.  </TEXT>
