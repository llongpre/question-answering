   There's one rare black mink coat for a mere
$50,000, a gem-encrusted butterfly brooch for a quarter million,
and a New Orleans Mardi Gras excursion for about six grand.
   For less extravagant shoppers, how about the lead item in this
year's Neiman Marcus Christmas catalogue: His and Hers 1990
``chairpersons.''
   Straight-backed wooden chairs designed by artist Philip Grace
become life-size portraits of your choice. At $6,000 each, they're
art you can really use.
   ``People are always interested in seeing what we have for the
His and Hers gifts. Every year we look for something that hasn't
been done before,'' said Jan Roberts, Neiman vice president of
public relations in New York.
   ``Some years they're really expensive gifts, some years they're
animals. It doesn't always have to have the same feel,'' she said.
   The tony, Dallas-based department store on Tuesday began sending
out 3 million copies worldwide of its holiday wish book famous for
items ranging from the silly to the sublime.
   This year there's the usual Russian caviar packed in gold-lined
tins at $295 per gram, as well as knickknacks, clothes, food and
other things, many at regular department store prices.
   In the one-of-a-kind category is an original Gypsy house
trailer, ornately carved and painted, supposedly ``once both home
and transportation to an important English Gypsy.''
   Ms. Roberts said the caravan, obtained from a Midwestern
collector is ``really spectacular ... a little museum on wheels.''
   ``We will probably sell it,'' she said.
   She said the company already has received inquiries about
another singular item _ Napoleon's spectacles.
   The gold-rimmed reading glasses used by the French emperor,
possibly for occasions of state, are priced at $90,000 and come
with a certificate of authenticity and leather case.
   The 1991 Mardi Gras trip offers ``a special cachet to join the
elite inner circle'' of New Orleans revelers. It includes five days
and four nights of debauchery for $5,898 for one person, $600 each
additional person.
   ``And there's a lot of stuff in this book that's just for you
and me,'' Ms. Roberts said. ``Things that are still whimsical and
unique, but aren't necessarily expensive.
   ``One of my favorites is the gold Slinky. It would make a great
executive gift,'' she said.
   The gold-plated toy, which is a large spring that ``walks'' down
stairs, is $55.
   Also for executive-level children is a dollop of Silly Putty in
its own engraved sterling silver egg for $95 to commemorate the
40th anniversary of the novelty.
   And for the family pet there's a Pooch Palace, described as ``a
canine dream home.'' It's 6 feet tall with an AstroTurf base and a
car door window permanently rolled down. All for only $3,220.
