   Rick Baker is an Academy Award-winning makeup
man, but not many stars would ask him for a touch-up before facing
the camera.
   Well, maybe Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi. Lon Chaney would have
been delighted.
   Baker's specialty is creating movie monsters. He won the first
annual Oscar award for special makeup effects in 1981 for ``An
American Werewolf in London.'' Last month, he won a second Academy
Award for his makeup work in ``Harry and the Hendersons.''
   His work can be seen every Friday on CBS' ``Beauty &amp; the
Beast,'' for which he created the face of the kindly Beast, Vincent.
   One of his most malevolent creatures stars in the NBC miniseries
``Something Is Out There,'' airing Sunday and Monday. Baker created
the ``something,'' a grotesque alien that comes to Earth and begins
a series of grisly murders.
   Joe Cortese stars as a detective investigating the strange
deaths. Maryam D'Abo co-stars as a mysterious woman he learns is
from another planet and is pursuing the creature.
   ``I started with a sketch, which I showed to the producer,''
said Baker, in an interview at his Glendale studio. ``Once we all
agreed, I did a clay mockup.''
   Two assistants hauled out the mockup, which was about 4 feet
long and looked like a mutant scorpion. It also has some spider
features and its back is covered with huge spikes, like a dinosaur.
   ``It's a space bug,'' Baker explained, ``and we call it Spike
because it has so many spikes. It's able to change appearance and
take over the body of its victims. We constructed a tail section
that's 12 feet long. The creature we built for the movie is much
nastier looking than this. It has a number of finger-like feelers
on its face, which makes it look like someone stuck a big spider on
his face.''
   With looks like that, imagine Spike's personality. ``It has a
terrible personality, if you can call it that,'' Baker said.
```It's really just a killing machine that's trying to survive.''
   Baker said it's much more graphic than what's usually allowed on
television.
   ``I don't know how much they'll allow on the air,'' he said.
``It was difficult to do and keep it acceptable.''
   At an age when most kids were playing cops and robbers or
cowboys and Indians, Baker was creating monsters.
   ``I already knew what I wanted to do with my life when I was
10,'' he said. ``I was fascinated by Frankenstein. I wanted to know
who made it. My father was an artist and he taught me a few basic
things. I bought books on sculpting and mold making.
   ``I lived in Covina, but I had no connection with the movie
business. That made it very difficult to get started. I grew up
working with grease paint, putty and making rubber masks.
   ``I was very shy and I found that when I made myself up I could
things I wouldn't do otherwise. Also, I loved to fool people. The
first time I did a gash on my arm, my mother thought I was really
hurt. I did a lot of blood-and-gore stuff when I was a kid. I
scared so many people I wasn't allowed in a lot of houses.''
   His first job, while still in high school, was making up stage
actors. Then he went to work for a stop-motion animation studio
making models for ``Gumby'' and ``Davy and Goliath.''
   ``I did my first film my second year in college,'' he said. ``It
was `Octo-Man,' part octopus and part man. I made the costume for
$500. I used almost all the money I got for the job to make it as
good as possible. After that, I never really had to look for a job.
People came to me.''
   His first major job was making Cicely Tyson look 100 years old
in ``The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.'' He was only 20 and
won an Emmy.
   For the remake of ``King Kong,'' he made the ape suits and even
played the part of the big gorilla. ``They couldn't find anyone
else stupid enough to wear the suit,'' he said.
   He made most of the creatures in the cantina scene in ``Star
Wars,'' including the grotesque band.
   His study of gorillas came in handy for ``Greystoke: The Legend
of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,'' for which he made all the ape
costumes.
   ``I made 27 costumes,'' Baker said. ``I had to have different
heads, different hands. It took 10 months to do the suits with 90
people. We kept working right to the end of the picture. They
wanted people to think those were real apes. They weren't.''
