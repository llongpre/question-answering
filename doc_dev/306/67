<LEADPARA>  Q Some hairline cracks are developing in the stucco coating on our house.
What's the best treatment?;    A Shallow hairline cracks in stucco are often
best left alone since they seldom endanger the stucco or wall, and repair can
be uglier than the defect.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If cracks are wide enough to be unsightly and for water to seep into them
and cause trouble, a flexible caulking compound can be used for patching.;   
A high-quality acrylic-latex caulk works well and can be painted if necessary.
Cut the tip of the caulk cartridge so the bead of caulk will be about the same
width as the cracks.;    If an air compressor is available, clean the cracks
with puffs of compressed air; otherwise, use a small brush to remove loose
particles and dust. Use a caulking gun to squeeze caulk into the cracks.;   
With a wet putty knife, smooth or texture the caulk to match the stucco
surface. If the stucco is white and white caulk is used, painting is not
usually necessary. Otherwise, wait till the caulk cures -- check curing
directions on the label -- and use an exterior latex paint and touch-up brush
to tint it to match the stucco.;    Larger cracks in stucco sometimes indicate
that the foundation or wall is shifting. Repairs may not last long because the
cracks can change in shape or size.;    If shifting is suspected, it is best
to have the house checked by an experienced masonry contractor or structural
engineer. If larger cracks appear to be stabilized, or there are small peeled
areas, repairs can be made with ready-mix stucco patch, sold at some
building-supply outlets in several common stucco colors. Patches will
generally hold better if the edges of stucco around the damaged area are
undercut with a sharp chisel to help lock the patch in place.;    Severe
damage to stucco is best repaired by an expert. Three coats of stucco are
usually needed, and the wire grid or lath that grips the stucco may also have
to be repaired.  </TEXT>
