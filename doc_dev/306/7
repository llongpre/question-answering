   Finding a chip, gouge or hole on a piece of furniture does not
mean it's ruined. Damaged furniture can be restored with a patching
material made just for wood.
   Most furniture will receive some damage with heavy use. Chances
are that furniture bought at a yard sale or auction will have at
least one chip or gouge.
   Restoring furniture is simple, rewarding, and saves money on
professional repair bills. The trick is knowing what materials to
use and how to do the work.
   For your repair work, a premixed, synthetic compound gives good
results. One kind is made of latex and pulverized wood for a patch
of maximum workability and woodlike texture.
   For generations, cabinet-makers made their own patching material
by mixing hot animal glue or vinyl resin with fine sawdust. Some
purists still make their own wood patch, substituting woodworkers
glue for animal glue.
   Synthetic latex compounds are easy to use. You apply them from
the container with a putty knife, or directly into voids from a
plastic squeeze tube. They can be nailed, sawed, sanded or drilled,
and can be used for repairs both indoors and out.
   Patching damaged furniture, whether unfinished, painted or
stained, is easy enough for any do-it-yourselfer.
   First, to remove dirt, grease, oil and loose particles from the
damaged area, rub the surface with a lint-free cloth dampened with
mineral spirits, paint thinner, or a liquid sander.
   Wait 30 minutes for the surface to dry, then dampen the area to
be repaired with water. Water stops the wood from absorbing
moisture in the latex wood patch. Otherwise, the patching material
cures too quickly and might shrink and crack.
   John Molski, technical director of United Gilsonite
Laboratories, Scranton, Pa., offers these tips for using a latex
wood putty:
   ``Press the patching material tightly into the void with a putty
knife. Fill holes that are less than one-quarter inch deep and wide
in one application. Make sure the patch is slightly higher than the
surrounding wood.
   ``Wipe off the excess material around the hole with a dampened
cloth. When the patch is dry, sand it until it's level with the
surrounding surface.''
   Holes more than one-quarter inch deep and wide, Molski says,
should be filled with several layers of patch. Let each layer dry
befre applying the next.
   Sand the repair, using medium-grade sandpaper attached to a
sanding block. Failure to use a sanding block can result in ripples
on the patch and surrounding wood. This is especially true when
sanding softwoods like pine.
   Always sand with the wood grain. When done, wipe the surface
with a tack cloth or clean rag dampened with mineral spirits to
remove dust.
   The drying time for wood patching products differs. Read the
label before sanding, painting or staining.
   Follow normal surface preparations before refinishing the
damaged area.
   A refinishing tip: to improve the color match between the latex
patch and the wood, mix some finish with the patching material
before repairing the damage. Test the patch on an inconspicuous
part of the wood _ the underside of a table, for instance _ to see
if it blends with the original finish.
   If you have trouble matching the patch with a stained surface,
mix a combination of maple, mahogany and walnut stain with the
patching compond. With a little work, you can match almost any
stain using these three colors.
   Do not confuse wood patching products with paste wood fillers.
The fillers are designed for filling the open grains in certain
hardwoods like oak, mahogany and walnut prior to finishing.
   Hiding minor scratches does not require the use of a wood patch.
For a simple fix, rub a wet tea bag or shoe polish on the scratch.
Specially designed wax sticks can also be used. They are available
in different colors.
   If you're looking for the country look, repair major damage such
as broken legs or rotted wood, but leave surface blemishes and
minor scratches alone. These random markings give the piece its
character.
