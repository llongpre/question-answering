<LEADPARA>  THE MUMMIFIED man discovered in a melting Alpine glacier in September is older
than first believed, dating from the late Neolithic rather than the Early
Bronze Age, scientists and historians say.;   Two independent tests of
radiocarbon dates have been conducted on pieces of grass from a woven mat
found with the man. They show he died at least 4,600 years ago, or about 2,600
B.C., said Sigmar Bortenschlager, director of the Institute of Botany at the
University of Innsbruck, which commissioned the datings.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Historians then discovered that an ax found with the man is of nearly pure
copper, not bronze, as first believed, said Markus Egg, a prehistorian from
the Romisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum in Mainz, Germany, where the man's
equipment is being studied. "Axes of pure copper were no longer used in the
Bronze Age," Egg said.;   The man was first believed to be from the Early
Bronze Age because the ax is of a style common to that time. But Egg said the
style was also used in the Neolithic Age and had been found throughout
Europe.;   Pieces of the body, which is being kept in Innsbruck, will also be
dated at laboratories in Zurich and England.;   Examination of the body, which
is the oldest naturally preserved corpse ever found, has been stalled because
of a dispute over its ownership.;   Geographers determined in October that the
man, who was discovered at 10,500 feet by mountain climbers on the Similaun
glacier, was actually on Italian territory. Austrian and Italian officials
were expected to sign a contract this week giving the University of Innsbruck
the right to conduct research on the body.;   In the meantime, evidence now
suggests that the man was a shepherd who was caught in a snowstorm on his way
over the mountains.;   "Not one arrow was prepared for shooting," said Egg,
noting that a hunter would most likely have been ready to fire his weapon.
"This means that he didn't feel threatened.";   But he added that the man had
with him all the necessary arrowheads and feathers and a type of putty to
attach them to the arrow's shaft.  </TEXT>
