FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kalon makes Pounds 6.2m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalon, the paints group, is expanding its penetration of the specialist
decorative products market via the acquisition of the principal assets and
goodwill of Vallance &amp; Co, a subsidiary of Den Braven Sealants, for about
Pounds 6.2m cash, including Pounds 5.2m for tangible assets.
Products within the Vallance range include sealants, putties, fillers, fire
cement, tile adhesive, grouts and liquid nails. This latter has the fastest
growing sales.
Den Braven retains its trade sales of sealants. Because of this, no profits
figure can be attributed to the acquired business, though sales have been
stated as Pounds 12.5m.
