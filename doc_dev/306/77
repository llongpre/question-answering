<HEAD>British Revelers in Night of `Silly Horseplay'</HEAD>

   British revelers invaded a luxury
resort hotel and hauled off paintings and other objects in a night
of ``silly horseplay'' that drew banner headlines Monday in the
nation's leading tabloid.
   The Blick newspaper said 50 to 60 jeering partygoers entered the
hotel lobby Saturday night to the wail of bagpipes and ``tried to
take away everything that wasn't nailed down.''
   Some climbed to the roof and tried to haul down the Swiss flag
and others tried to steal a Rolls-Royce parked at the hotel, the
newspaper said.
   Authorities said paintings also were taken.
   Police described the events as the ``turbulent outcome of a
wager.'' They said the attack stemmed from a dinner party in nearby
Samaden, where a prize was promised to the person removing the
``most beautiful object'' from the Palace Hotel.
   About 20 people were detained but released without charges,
police said.
   ``It was more or less silly horseplay,'' said police officer
Werner Haffner.
