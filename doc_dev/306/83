   Former U.S. Rep. John Jenrette says his
arrest on charges of stealing a pair of shoes from a suburban
Washington store was ``a silly, silly mistake.''
   Jenrette, convicted in 1980 in the FBI's Abscam probe, was
charged last month with petty larceny and altering price tags at a
department store in Baileys Crossroads, Va., according to Fairfax
County District Court records.
   He is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 1, said his lawyer, Warren
McLain of Fairfax, Va.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette told The State
newspaper from Georgetown Saturday. He said if he hadn't lost his
temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the arrest ``probably wouldn't have
happened,'' the newspaper reported Sunday.
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes when
he heard that cars parked outside were being towed and that he
walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had parked
his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
A heated argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette, who lives in Myrtle Beach with his sister, denied
charges that he altered prices on a pair of pants and a shirt from a
clearance table.
   Under Virginia law, each misdemeanor charge carries a maximum
penalty of up to 12 months in jail.
   Jenrette was sentenced to two years in prison and five years'
probation on bribery and conspiracy charges in the Abscam sting
operation in which FBI agents posed as Arab sheiks and businessmen
offering bribes to lawmakers. He served 13 months.
   Jenrette, who describes himself as a recoverning alcoholic and
has helped establish a center from children of alcoholics in Myrtle
Beach, acknowledged this latest incident in his life ``is going to
be devastating.''
   He has applied for reinstatement to practice law, a matter that
is to be considered by the South Carolina Bar Association in May, he
said.
   ``I'm afraid this will affect their deliberations,'' he said.
