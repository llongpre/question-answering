Rudy Ramirez Jr. maintains that he is 5-feet-7 and weighs 145 pounds, but the 
standout senior running back for Bell Gardens High School has a difficult time 
convincing others that he is that big. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ramirez was listed at 5-6 and 140 when he was named to the 
Southern Section's Division IV team after gaining 1,049 yards and scoring 23 
touchdowns for the Whitmont League champion Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's Southern Section preview guide, which normally adds height and 
weight to returning players, Ramirez was pumped up to only 5-8 and 150. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell tends to play down Ramirez's size. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Rudy is 5-6 and about 139 pounds," Newell said. "And, he may 
be closer to 5-5." 
</P>
<P>
Even at home, Ramirez, who claims to be the second-tallest in his family, has 
to deal with questions regarding his size. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a sister who is two inches taller than me and sometimes I wish that I 
had her height," he said. "But, I am taller than my dad, even though he doesn't 
like to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
Debates regarding Ramirez's physical stature may go one forever, but there are 
not many questions about his talents on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
After six games this season, Ramirez is among the Southern Section leaders in 
scoring with 16 touchdowns, and in rushing with 615 yards. In Bell Gardens' 
47-14 win over California High of Whittier last Friday night, he rushed for 147 
yards and scored three touchdowns. "Ramirez has really carried the load for us 
this season," Newell said. "We have had to give him the ball more because we 
have had so many big games early. Despite his size, he is very durable. After 
every game he can barely walk, but he has not missed a practice in two years." 
</P>
<P>
Getting attention because of his football playing skills is nothing new to 
Ramirez, who began playing touch football in the street in front of his house 
when he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was small, I have always been pretty good and people looked up to me 
for that," Ramirez said. "I never doubted myself despite having people always 
tell me that I was too small." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez became known to Newell and his staff at Bell Gardens as a 5-4, 
110-pound freshman. In his first full season of contact football, Ramirez 
proved to be as elusive in pads as he was when he played touch football at Bell 
Gardens City Park in junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been pretty easy for me because I am quick and I know where I am 
going all of the time, while the defense doesn't," Ramirez said. "I am not all 
of that fast, but when I'm making a move, I just seem to make the right 
decision against the defense." 
</P>
<P>
One of Ramirez's biggest fans is Newell, who has coached Bell Gardens to 11 
consecutive playoff appearances. Newell says that sometimes he cannot believe 
Ramirez's toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"He is like Silly Putty," Newell said. "No one ever gets a full hit on him. He 
just flows like music. . . . He is constant motion on the field where sometimes 
a defender will get three chances to tackle him on the same play." 
</P>
<P>
Newell points to a game earlier this season against Montebello, which Bell 
Gardens won, 28-20, as an indication of Ramirez's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"In that game, he was almost knocked unconscious in the first quarter and 
missed a play and then in the fourth quarter he missed another after throwing 
up all over himself," Newell said. "All he did was account for over 360 yards 
in total offense while scoring four touchdowns. It was just a tremendous human 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
A Golden League football game between Palmdale and Saugus last Friday night at 
College of the Canyons was suspended in the fourth quarter after a Palmdale 
player allegedly attacked an official. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Palmdale's Darius Wilson, 18, grabbed back judge 
Bradley Woolley and threw him to the ground after three consecutive personal 
foul penalties were called against Palmdale. The game was suspended with the 
score tied, 0-0, and 7:40 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 175-pound Wilson was arrested after the game on suspicion of 
misdemeanor battery charges and may face criminal charges, according to Elliott 
Fisher of the Newhall district attorney's office. Wilson was released Friday 
night on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a wide receiver-defensive back, also faces disciplinary action from 
school administrators, according to Principal Linda Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale and Saugus school administrators met with Southern Section officials 
Monday to review videotape of the incident. The Southern Section office will 
rely on Golden League officials to determine the outcome of the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Southern Section officials are expected to make 
recommendations within the next two days regarding disciplinary action against 
either school, according to Saugus Athletic Director Randy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
With Beverly Hills teachers on strike, Beverly Hills High's fall athletic 
programs will suffer. Coaches of four of the school's five fall sports honored 
the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Jack Dyck said that the football, tennis, cross-country and 
volleyball coaches were out but that the water polo team will continue play 
under its walk-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches are very upset and frustrated regarding the strike but they will 
remain united," Dyck said. "Every fall team is in playoff contention and their 
chances of making the playoffs will be hurt with the strike." 
</P>
<P>
A girls' tennis match has been canceled and Principal Ben Bushman said that 
Friday night's football game at Santa Monica will be forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the strike ends soon, but it doesn't look good," Dyck said. 
"As of now, everything in our athletic department is shut down and the 
possibilities of replacing the coaches with walk-on volunteers is not our first 
choice because we are concerned about the kids getting quality coaching without 
any compromises."

held this weekend at Mt. San Antonio College, featuring more than 300 schools
