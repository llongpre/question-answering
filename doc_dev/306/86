<LEADPARA>  There's no end to what people save. Like birds' eggs that are more than 100
years old. Back in the 1880s, Washington Township was an agricultural area
with creeks, orchards and wooded lands -- prime territory for finding bird
eggs.;    Just such a collection of 150 eggs was saved by Michael Justus
Overacker of a pioneer Fremont/Centerville family. The egg shells, packed away
in the original boxes, have been under the care of the Mission Peak Heritage
Foundation since 1977. (Yes, the contents have long since been blown out.)
Many of the best specimens are displayed along with bird photographs by noted
wildlife photographer Rachel Lamoreux and nature paintings by Thomas Cory,
both of Fremont, in an appealing exhibit called "Fragile Beauty: Wildlife
Images." The show opened at the Olive Hyde Art Gallery in Fremont last week.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A national, prize-winning wildlife photographer, Lamoreux has traveled from
the Arctic Circle to the Galapagos Islands photographing birds. Her work has
appeared on the cover of the National Wildlife Federation's Ranger Rick
magazine and has been used in National Geographic educational film strips.;   
At 81, she warns that wildlife photography is not for the faint-hearted. "You
need a lot of time, a lot of patience and a love of nature," she observes.
"And you have to stand the flies and the gnats.";    The beautifully colored
birds display a range of personality as diverse as human portraits in a
gallery. Some look as noble as Roman senators in profile or as silly as
clowns. A red-shouldered hawk conveys the message, "Don't mess with me." An
apricot-colored nesting avocet, seems wary -- just a millisecond away from
sensing an intruder.;    Labels accompanying the photographs are helpful,
indicating which birds may be found locally at such sites as Coyote Hills,
even though they were photographed, say, in Florida. Many of the birds are in
camouflage settings, where their speckled feathers blend with rocks or
foliage.;    Painter Thomas Cory, a Fremont art teacher, explores similar
relationships of winged creatures to their backgrounds in his realistic oil
and watercolor paintings of butterflies and moths. Often the viewer must
search to distinguish the butterfly from the rocks, twigs, lily pads or flower
petals on which it rests. Some paintings, such as "West Coast Lady" and
"Tailed Copper" display strong abstract design and color as well.;    Cory's
focus is on the intimate moment. The moth has just lighted on the branch. The
viewer has just spotted the moth.;    Lamoreux's and Cory's birds and
butterflies are meticulously identified. But the task of labeling the
Overacker egg collection was more formidable, said Cynthia Raap, gallery
director. She and Central Park Ranger Laurie Skaling spent hours with the eggs
and a clutch of reference books, cross-identifying them from Overacker's
handwritten -- and sometimes contradictory -- inventory. Sizes range from a
giant ostrich egg (obviously imported) down to tiny hummingbird eggs.;
IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; "Fragile Beauty: Wildlife Images" continues at the Olive
