<LEADPARA>  Q Little plants keep growing in the cracks in my concrete driveway and
sidewalk, and I'm afraid they'll make the cracks bigger. I was thinking of
using a weed killer to get rid of them, but my husband vetoed that, saying the
weed killer is hazardous, especially with a 2-year-old around. How can I get
rid of the plants?;   A First of all, the plants will not make the cracks
bigger. Second, weed killer, or any herbicide, is very hazardous to one's
health.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why not try digging out the plants by hand? Doing it after a rain makes it
easier. If you pull a weed and it breaks off at the sidewalk level, scrape out
the rest with a putty knife. You could use a salt solution to kill the weeds,
but the salt will eventually seep into the ground water.;   Q I am installing
quarter-inch pegboard in my garden shed. How can I paint it without plugging
the holes? Will painting it on both sides protect it from termites? Also, how
can I fill little dimples left in my concrete foundation when some masonry
nails were pulled out. They are half an inch deep and 1 1/2 inches wide.;   A
Painting both sides of the pegboard won't protect it from termites; I don't
think anything will except treating the garden shed for the insects. Use a
roller to paint; the holes are unlikely to fill up, and you can poke them open
again with a small dowel after the paint dries. Or, use a latex stain instead
of paint.;   Fill the dimples in the foundation with mortar, but apply a
bonding agent to the dimples first; nothing will work without the bonding
agent.;   Q I have noticed decay in one floorboard of my back porch, where the
porch meets the top step. There is also some rot on the bulkhead door. I don't
see any signs of destructive insects. Should I have these areas inspected? How
should I deal with the decayed wood?;   A I would bet those areas are ordinary
decay from water and possibly a fungus. After all, unprotected -- even painted
-- wood will decay if water gets on it for long periods of time. So no
inspection is needed.;   You should replace the rotted floorboard, possibly
with a pressure-treated board. As you remove the board, you may run into more
rotted boards farther back in the porch, and you'll have to replace those,
too. If the boards run at right angles to the house (with the end grain
showing over the top step) you may have trouble removing individual boards,
and might have to replace the entire porch floor, or at least remove several
of the boards before you get to the rotted one.;   When you remove the boards,
you might find the joists (beams) under the boards rotting, too. These will
have to be replaced.  </TEXT>
