   Safaris, Caribbean soirees and circus gymnasts were
just a few of the themes at Saturday's shows of 1990 summer
fashions. Curvy and feminine clothes emphasized the bust in
virtually all designs, from Claude Montana to Jean-Louis Scherrer.
   Montana, who has just been chosen to design couture for the
house of Lanvin, seemed to be skimping on his ideas for his own
house, perhaps saving up for January when he'll show for Lanvin. He
concentrated on rigorously honed-down curvaceous clothes, much
softer than many of his past styles.
   There was hardly a skirt in sight.
   Montana put very few accessories on the figure-hugging corsair
body suits and belted, drawstring-tied jackets with shorts. In
spicy shades of cinnamon, clove, curry, saffron and dill green,
some of the safari jackets with saddlebag pockets had daring
V-shaped decolletes.
   Memorable for color and shape were the tomato linen shortie
coats split into several panels, with pushed-up puffy sleeves worn
over shorts or long pants.
   Another terrific look is in Montana's version of the
opaque-transparent theme popular all over town. He paired long and
sober raw silk or linen jackets with flowing pleated sheer
georgette crepe pants.
   His most revealing styles were centered on see-through silk and
viscose cobweb tops _ another favorite Paris theme done daringly
here, paired with clinging silk stretch tights.
   Also in the ``second-skin'' vein were the clinging outfits with
matching string or rope decor strung like strands of pearls across
a shoulder, at the hip or on bare backs, the sober shades of brown,
rust, khaki and putty merely emphasizing the curvy figure
underneath.
   This was perfect in a sheath topped with a transparent, wide
organza jacket, showing the designer's sheer perfection of line,
although it's not for timid souls with figure problems.
   For Scherrer, there were no endangered species, as he brought
out every kind of animal print _ leopards, tigers, zebras, often
best worn by his favorite model, his blond daughter Laetitia.
   The big cat prints pounced onstage in bermudas and billowing
tops, in gracefully wrapped and draped dresses and bathing suits
cut out to show lots of skin, and even decorated lapels of tailored
suits.
   He, too, went for a transparent-solid look, combining sheer
animal-print blouses and pants with solid linen safari jackets.
Wild-animal prints are already all over the streets here, but it
still looked great at Scherrer.
   His more sober daytime ideas included soft paisley prints in
suits, sharp navy coat dresses with striking white lapels decollete
to the waist, and a range of lovely softly checked and glen plaid
pastel suits in silk and cool wools.
   Scherrer also laid on a Caribbean soiree. It was a blazing color
show, with casual, draped sarongs, knotted shirts and shorts or
cropped-pants outfits in multicolored batik flower patterns.
   His gorgeous evening clothes were delicately edged in arum
lilies, magnolias and garlands of sequined embroidery by master
embroiderer Francois Lesage. Coming out in satin sheaths, silk
pajamas or ball gowns with full organza skirts, the women had tank
tops or bustiers, always underlining the female curves.
   Issey Miyake's show was full of stretchy gymnasts' suits and
corsair pants, spotlighting the sportier side of summer fashion.
   His yellow, royal blue or red-and-white striped or
harlequin-patterned stretch cotton pant suits with their boxy
jackets would make a jaunty entry to the beach scene. The
turtle-shaped or chrome-hooped handbags added wonderful touches of
wit to this fun show of bouncy clothes.
   Yellow, black and white or turquoise tailcoats paired with
bicolored corsairs or cropped wider pants were another theme.
   An artist with silhouettes as well as fabrics, Miyake also
showed some great new shirt shapes over short-shorts, the tops
centered on triangular elbows in dolman sleeves, in striped cotton
or in pleated, stiffened fabrics Miyake often favors.
   Dressier and more feminine clothes were shown by Michel Goma at
Balenciaga in a show that was not only full of peppy stuff, but
sometimes had touches of the inimitable Balenciaga in couture
shapes and luxurious silk fabrics.
   The champagne lace and silk tunics and lean short skirts looked
just as easy to wear as the brightly colored crepe de chine
flowered dresses with long linen jackets.
   Some lovely white piques with caramel organza touches looked
great when cut out at the back _ as did the multicolored flowered
organza dance dresses, or the pastel crepe georgette pleated
Charleston dresses edged in lace at the hems.
   The billowy organza evening dresses were perfect for debutantes
and other young-hearted party girls.
   Most remarkable was the royal blue bustier dress with a huge bow
at the top, a big bell-shaped flounced skirt shorter in front to
reveal buttoned organza leggings underneath. It was worthy of
Balenciaga.
