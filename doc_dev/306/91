   When Nezar Hindawi wanted to blow up an Israeli
plane in 1986, he packed his girlfriend's suitcase with three pounds
of an odorless explosive called Semtex and sent her to London's
Heathrow airport to board an El Al Boeing 747.
   The bomb, which was pre-set to detonate, passed through an
airport X-ray machine, and it was discovered only after an El Al
security guard questioned the young woman, Anne-Marie Murphy, who
was unaware she was carrying the explosive device.
   Terrorism experts say Semtex, which is one of the substances
suspected in the bombing last week of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland, is a terrorist's dream. So far, it has defied all
detection attempts by X-ray machines, dogs trained to sniff bombs
and other devices.
   ``It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly
harder to detect than anything else _ it's more powerful than other
plastics,'' said George Carver, a senior CIA analyst in the 1960s
and 1970s who now is a researcher at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   Like its American cousin, C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and
shows up on an X-ray operator's screen as an indistinct, dense mass.
But unlike C-4 and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is odorless.
   Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it cannot
go off unless it is meant to. Terrorism experts, including Neil
Livingstone of Georgetown University, say Semtex is so reliable it
has been used by Arab terrorists sending letter bombs to Israeli
officials.
   Technology is being developed to overcome the Semtex threat, and
two experimental devices are in use at the Los Angeles and San
Francisco airports. The devices shoot neutrons which can interact
chemically with plastic explosives in luggage and indicate the
existence of a bomb.
   Czechoslovakia, which has a well-developed, state-run arms and
munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant called the Eastern
Bohemian Works, Livingstone said. State Department officials say
they have asked Czech authorities in the past to stop making Semtex
or at least to prevent its export.
   Recently, Czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop
selling Semtex, said Livingstone, who has served as a consultant to
government security and intelligence agencies and has written seven
books on international security and terrorism.
   Czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied Semtex to Syria and
Libya, said one State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In testimony at Hindawi's 1986 trial, British authorities said
Syria had supplied the bomb for the El Al plane. The British
government subsequently broke off diplomatic relations with Syria
over the affair, although ties later were restored.
   The State Department official said Libya has supplied Semtex in
several shiploads of weapons to the Irish Republican Army in 1986
and 1987 and may have given it to other terrorist groups.
   Semtex also is believed to have been used by a tiny Syrian- and
Libyan-supported Palestinian group once known as the May 15
organization and which is now known as the Hawari group.
   The group is believed to have been responsible for the April 1986
explosion aboard a TWA Boeing 727 flying from Rome to Athens. Four
Americans were killed in the blast, which Greek investigators said
probably was caused by a Semtex bomb the size of two or three
cigarette packs. The bomb was placed under a seat in row 10.
   The Hawari group specializes in plastic bombs, according to U.S.
counterterrorism experts. One of its operatives, Mohammed Rashid, is
being sought by the United States for questioning in the 1982
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Hawaii which resulted in one death.
