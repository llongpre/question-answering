Removing wallpaper is a messy job, but somebody's got to do it, and that 
somebody will probably be you. 
</P>
<P>
Finding somebody else to do it is probably more difficult than doing it 
yourself. Professional paperhangers often don't want to do it and when they do, 
they charge a premium rate. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, this job is more messy than difficult. It's a good example of the 
kind of grunt work homeowners can do themselves. This job requires little skill 
and few tools, just scraping and patience. With the advent of improved 
wallpaper and removing tools, teamed with time-proven methods, the job is 
easier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Not all wallpapers are created equal, meaning that some are more difficult to 
strip than others. The easiest to remove are the "strippable" wallpapers. They 
can be removed without tearing or being loosened by water or steam. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more difficult to remove are old, untreated and uncoated wallpapers. 
They simply need to be wetted and scraped loose. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult to remove are the paper with vinyl coating (washable 
wallpapers) or those with laminated surfaces of woven fabric or foils. 
Wallpaper that's been painted falls into this category. These papers are 
difficult to strip because water doesn't penetrate their surface as readily as 
with uncoated paper. 
</P>
<P>
Old-fashioned wallpaper comes off easily if you get enough moisture behind it. 
It's held up with wheat paste adhesive, a substance easily softened by water. 
These porous papers absorb water, hastening the decomposition of the paste. 
</P>
<P>
Stripping the paper is even easier if you mix some wallpaper remover in the 
water. The remover, sold at paint and hardware stores, has wetting agents that 
penetrate the paper and soften the paste. Some strippers also have enzymes that 
attack the wheat paste and dissolve it. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl, foil-faced and other moisture-resistant wallpapers are designed to be 
cleaned. The challenge, then, is to get moisture behind their water-resistant 
face to soften the glue. Wallpaper remover is not as effective on coated papers 
as uncoated. The solution is to steam the paper loose, then scrape it off the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
You have to prepare these papers before steaming them. The easiest way to get 
the steam or water behind a coated wall covering is to score the surface to 
allow moisture to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
If the paper is old and there are several painted layers, most of the layers 
can be scraped off with a razor scraper. This is harder work than steaming off 
individual layers, but it's much faster than trying to steam down through 
individual layers. 
</P>
<P>
Strippable wallpapers simply peel off the wall when gently pulled from a 
corner. At a seam, lift the corner of the paper with a putty knife or scraper 
and pull toward you. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully remove the adhesive left on the wall with a fresh blade in a razor 
scraper. Since the paste is dry and hard, most of the heavy residue can be 
scraped off. Then wash the walls with warm water and detergent.
