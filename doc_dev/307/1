   Tourists have chiseled so many souvenirs out
of the Berlin Wall that some sections are in danger of collapsing,
and police have had to cordon off one especially hard-hit area near
the Brandenburg Gate.
   The East German government plans eventually to tear down the
entire wall and replace it with normal border markings, President
Manfred Gerlach disclosed in an interview last week. But free-lance
demolition work has already proceeded on the 100-mile border
barrier, especially on the West Berlin side.
   East German border guards on Sunday welded steel bars over a
gaping hole near the Brandenburg Gate to shore up the reinforced
concrete structure.
   West Berlin police put up crowd control barriers Saturday around
the most damaged sections to keep adults and children from climbing
inside giant holes carved out of a double-walled segment. Police
cited a danger of collapse.
   Once covered by graffiti, the wall has been chipped bare at the
Brandenburg Gate, the 18th-century arch that now symbolizes German
unity.
   The wall has also taken a beating at Checkpoint Charlie, the
famed intra-Berlin crossing, but police said they do not fear a
collapse there.
   On Sunday, onlookers and chippers on the West Berlin side booed
when East German border guards welded steel bars over a 7-foot-high
hole at the Reichstag, the former seat of Germany's parliament near
the Brandenburg Gate.
   Enterprising vendors have been selling pieces of the wall for up
$30 and even rent hammers and chisels for do-it-yourself chipping.
   But each wall chunk removed means lost business for East Germany.
   An East German company said last month it plans to raise Western
currency by selling sections of the wall removed from the
Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, a square that was the hub of
1920s Berlin.
   Profits from sales are to go to humanitarian causes.
   Communist East German authorities have punched dozens of
crossings into the wall since their decision Nov. 9 to open borders
to the West, The action was the result of a sudden and peaceful
popular revolution that drummed hard-line Communist leaders out of
power.
