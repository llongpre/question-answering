<LEADPARA>  East German children used to present flowers every Aug. 13 to the troops who
guarded the Berlin Wall and supposedly protected them from fascism creeping in
from the West.;    Instead of flowers, Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared Monday
that prosecutions await guards in now-united Germany accused of killing nearly
200 would-be escapees from former East Germany.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The statement -- on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the erection of the
Berlin Wall -- reflects the changes in this country. Berliner Zeitung,
formerly an East German communist newspaper that reported dutifully how
important the Berlin Wall was as a barrier against fascism, devoted an
eight-page section Monday to the wall's history and the emotions that
accompanied its opening.;    Brandenburg Gate's new role;  The 200-year-old
Brandenburg Gate stood just on the east side of the 100-mile-long wall and
became part of the symbolism of divided Berlin, Germany and Europe. Now it is
refurbished and ready to take on a role as an east-west traffic artery.;   
Today, Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen will lay a wreath at the place where one
of the most heart-wrenching dramas occurred at the wall, in 1962, when
18-year-old Peter Fechter was shot trying to escape. He was left to bleed to
death.;    The Berliner Zeitung on Monday reprinted the death notice for the
last victim killed at the wall, Chris Gueffroy, who died Feb. 2, 1989. The
family said in the notice that he had died in a "tragic accident.";    Border
troops face charges;  A popular revolution forced the barricade open Nov. 9,
1989.;    Erich Honecker, who oversaw construction of the wall in 1961 before
he became head of the Communist Party, escaped to Moscow in March and will not
be prosecuted. But several former East German border troops already face
charges, and prosecutors are assembling evidence against other Communist
leaders of East Germany who issued the shoot-to-kill orders.  </TEXT>
