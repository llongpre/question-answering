Crosby, Stills and Nash, whose rock music roots reach back to the early years 
of the Berlin Wall, sang to several hundred chilly fans today in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate, telling them to keep chipping away at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Stills said the 20-minute performance with sidekicks David Crosby and 
Graham Nash was arranged on short notice, with help from the West Berlin 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"We just showed up yesterday and said, 'Hi, we're here, we want to sing,' " 
Stills told his audience, which included longtime fans of the group, curious 
tourists gazing across the wall at the gate's classical columns, as well as 
Berliners attracted by the music from the nearby snow-dusted Tiergarten park. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby, Stills and Nash, survivors of various headline bands from the 
mid-1960s, are the latest to bring music to the celebration of East Germans' 
new freedom to travel through the Berlin Wall, erected in 1961 to stem a flow 
of refugees to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and rocker Joe Cocker were among the musicians to 
perform near the wall on the first weekend after the Nov. 9 decision to lift 
travel restrictions.
