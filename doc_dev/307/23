   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz, in
an interview published Saturday, declared his country's allegiance
to socialism and said dismantling of more of the Berlin Wall
depends on West Germany.
   Krenz told London's Financial Times that a decision whether to
open the Brandenburg Gate will be based on cooperation from West
Germany and West Berlin.
   The newspaper quoted Krenz as saying, ``At the moment, we are
not planning to open it (the Brandenburg Gate). Whether we open it,
and when we open it, depends not on us but on the other side.''
There have been rumors that the crossing at the gate would soon be
open.
   The Financial Times reported Krenz said that although East
Germany opened its western border to virtually unrestricted travel
two weeks ago, the main Berlin Wall will remain in place to prevent
unification of East and West Germany.
   ``The falling away of the border would have significant
consequences for carrying out certain plans for reunification,''
Krenz said, and at the present ``the existence of two German states
is a question of stability and peace in Europe.''
   He also was quoted as saying it was unlikely that planned free
elections in East Germany could be held befsdore the end of 1990.
   Krenz became party chief Oct. 18 when hard-line leader Erich
Honecker was forced to resign.
   The Financial Times said the interview was conducted Friday in
Krenz's office at his party headquarters in East Berlin.
   It reported he criticized what he called West German efforts to
force East Germany into market-oriented reform in exchange for aid
and said, ``I cannot imagine East Germany as a capitalist country.''
   The newspaper said Krenz had these replies to questions on other
issues:
   East Germany's interest in joining the European Economic
Community is ``a difficult question to judge today.'' It is ``a
question ... to do with the common European house which we all want
to build.''
   East and West Germany could move toward a form of confederation
if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact alliance
dissolve.
   ``The question of reunification at the moment is not on the
agenda because it would totally change the power relationships in
Europe.''
   One reason for East Germany's economic difficulties is adherence
to an administrative system inherited from the Stalinist past.
   ``We are ready to take advice about making our state more
effective and attractive. But we are not ready to be dictated to
with conditions from any other country _ especially the Federal
Republic (West Germany).''
