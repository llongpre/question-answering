   West Germans vandalized the Berlin Wall, an
official called for its removal, and an East German tried to escape
to the West on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the day construction
began on the infamous barrier.
   Security forces also dispersed about 50 East Germans who tried
to demonstrate in East Berlin in front of the West German mission,
which was closed last week after a crowd of East Germans arrived
seeking refuge.
   Witnesses said the demonstrators tried to lay flowers at the
mission gates in an apparent act of solidarity with their
countrymen holed up inside demanding exit visas to the West. No
protesters were arrested.
   Dorothee Wilms, the West German minister for inter-German
affairs, criticized East Germany's effort ``to build up and perfect
the inhumane barriers'' between East and West. Her deputy chief,
Ottfried Hennig, predicted the wall would be taken down by the end
of the century.
   An unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the
Brandenburg Gate early Sunday, West German police said. The bomb
exploded when it crashed against the wall, but it burned out
without causing serious damage.
   The East German state news agency, ADN, said several masked
assailants from West Berlin damaged border barriers in the southern
sector of East Berlin.
   ADN, which did not describe the damage, said a diplomatic
protest would be lodged with West Berlin authorities.
   Witnesses at the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing between East
and West Berlin reported Sunday that at least one man attempted to
flee across the heavily guarded crossing just before noon. He was
arrested by East German border guards before reaching Western
territory, the witnesses said.
   In Budapest, Hungary, 200 people gathered at downtown
Voeroesmarty Square to protest the wall. The speakers, who included
young East German tourists, called for its demolition.
   Several displayed placards with slogans proclaiming, ``Make
Love, Not Wall,'' and ``We Have No Need of Any Control.'' No
violence was reported during the 40-minute demonstration.
   The August 13th Society, a human rights organization that
monitors East European refugee affairs, estimates that at least
40,000 East Germans have escaped across the borders with West
Germany since the wall was erected.
   Prior to 1961, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled to the
West, draining the Communist state of many of its top scientists,
artists and intellectuals. The number of escapes surged over the
last few months after Hungary began dismantling its border barriers
with Austria.
   East Germans can usually obtain permission to travel to Hungary,
a neighboring Communist ally, and an estimated 1,500 of them have
illegally crossed from there into Austria this summer.
   Several hundred East Germans have recently sought refuge at West
German embassies, which has prompted Bonn to close its embassy in
Budapest and its mission in East Berlin.
   East Germany on Saturday defended the Berlin Wall and said hopes
for its removal are ``illusory.'' Neues Deutschland, the newspaper
of the East German Communist Party, said the wall is ``a step
toward peace'' and that it will remain in place to prevent East
Germans from fleeing to the West.
