   Imelda Marcos' new attorney, trying to repair
the image of the former Philippine first lady, asks that people
compare her with Nancy Reagan.
   ``Suppose Mrs. Reagan were abducted from her home in California
and taken to the Philippines and charged in the Philippines with
crimes she allegedly committed in the U.S.,'' the attorney, Gerry
Spence said Friday. ``How do you think Mrs. Reagan would feel?''
   Spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on the
racketeering indictment that charged Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband, Ferdinand Marcos, with embezzling more than $100 million
from the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan real estate.
They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165 million in
loans. Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who had represented the family of
Karen Silkwood, was hired by Mrs. Marcos as part of changes in her
defense team that included the dropping of two other attorneys.

   East Germany will tear down a 600-foot
section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow
completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city
there, West German television said.
   Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage
points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of
passports or identity cards.
   The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section
without any official controls.
   ``The Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate will be torn down,''
the ZDF television network said Friday. ``East German border troops
will start the work on Monday.''

   Keith Haring, whose cartoon-like drawings
appeared in public spaces from New York City's subways to the
Berlin Wall, has died of AIDS. He was 31.
   Haring, who had been diagnosed with the AIDS virus more than a
year ago, died early Friday in his downtown Manhattan apartment,
said an assistant, Margaret Slabbert.
   Active in AIDS fund-raising, Haring returned from a European
trip a month ago and fell ill soon after.
   Haring's work, characterized by human and animal figures in an
energized setting, was admired worldwide and brought him a
lucrative business.

   A disease closely related to the AIDS virus
can almost certainly be traced back to an African monkey, which may
have given it to people by biting them, a researcher said.
   Dr. Vanessa M. Hirsch of Georgetown University said Friday the
West African epidemic of HIV-2 disease most likely comes from the
sooty mangabey, a nondescript charcoal-gray monkey that is now
endangered.
   The virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys. But
when humans contract the disease, it causes a serious illness that
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, although less
fatal.
   Hirsch said she believes HIV-2 was transmitted from monkeys to
people within the past century through a bite or some other close
contact.
