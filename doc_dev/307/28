   Vandals and New Year's Eve revelers
extensively damaged Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and neo-fascist
slogans were smeared on monuments in East German cities,
authorities reported Tuesday.
   Officials said one man died and about 300 people were hurt in
holiday celebrations along the Berlin Wall, the official ADN news
agency reported. They said many were treated for cuts from
shattered champagne bottles and for broken bones.
   More than 500,000 Germans gathered along the Berlin Wall to
cheer the arrival of 1990. Hundreds scaled the towering Brandenburg
Gate and nearby structures.
   The bronze chariot and horses atop the monument were damaged and
some sections will have to be replaced, said Horst Weiss of the
national office for protection of memorials.
   A laurel wreath affixed to a statue of the Greek goddess Nike
was stolen, and someone tried to break off an arm, Weiss told ADN.
   East Berlin police spokesman Michael Braemer told The Associated
Press the death of a 24-year-old West Berlin man found in East
Berlin was under investigation. Authorities first thought he died
when scaffolding holding up an outdoor projection screen collapsed
under the weight of revelers shortly after 1 a.m. on New Year's.
But Braemer said he may have fallen from a tree along Unter den
Linden.
   ADN said neo-Nazi groups smeared slogans on memorials in other
cities and some physical attacks were reported.
   In Pirna and Goerlitz near Dresden, ``Hitler Lives,'' and ``We
are here _ REP,'' the abbreviation for West Germany's ultraright
Republican Party, were scrawled on walls and windows, ADN said.
   In Goerlitz ``Foreigners Out'' and ``Jews Out'' were painted on
structures and a memorial to those persecuted under the Nazis was
daubed with swastikas, the agency said.
   Anti-communist demonstrators in Halle spraypainted ``SED _ No
Thank You'' on memorials, referring to the East German Communist
Party.
   ``Skinheads'' and neo-Nazi youths carrying homemade weapons
threatened passers-by in Erfurt and two people were hurt
confronting them, ADN said.
   The report said some of those arrested said they supported the
Republicans.
   ADN said Communist Party groups planned to protest in East
Berlin this week the recent spate of neo-Nazi activity in East
Germany.
