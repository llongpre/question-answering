   Berlin, so long divided by an ugly wall, is
being made whole again to resume its historic role as the capital
of a united Germany.
   Scaffolding covers the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of German unity,
for a facelift expected to take two years.
   There are plans to rebuild the Hotel Adlon, which sat on the
Pariser Platz in front of the towering gate, joined to the American
and British embassies in a sort of three-cornered sandwich.
   Hitler's brass, diplomats, foreign journalists, and everybody
who was anybody in the Berlin of the 1930s mingled at the fabled
Adlon.
   Bodo Freyer, one of East Berlin's leading city planners, is
reponsible for rebuilding old Berlin.
   Until the wall came down in November, Freyer's world ended at
Pariser Platz and the gate, which stands on the line dividing the
city.
   ``We never had to worry about what happened over there,'' he
said pointing at an empty white area denoting West Berlin on his
wall map. ``Now our task is to get the city to grow together
again.''
   To Freyer's delight, his job often takes him to the
once-forbidden zone to work with West Berlin planners on reviving
the central district, much of which is in East Berlin and went to
seed during four decades of communism.
   Less than 10 months after the wall opened, Berlin is booming. An
influx of 1.3 million East Germans has brought its population to
3.4 million.
   Planners don't know how many billions of dollars will be needed
to rebuild the city, but expect the process to last a decade.
   Between the world wars, Berlin was one of Europe's most dynamic
cities: an artistic mecca, a political and financial powerhouse,
and home to refugees escaping Communist upheaval in the east.
   In the 1920s, Marlene Dietrich electrified audiences in the
musical show ``Something's in the Air.''
   Great minds were drawn to Berlin. Albert Einstein taught physics
here, Jean-Paul Sartre came from Paris to philosophize, Vladimir
Nabokov wandered the streets in exile from Russia and wrote novels.
   The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s changed Berlin forever.
   Most of the Jewish community, the largest in Germany, fled or
perished in the Holocaust, and the world identified the city with
evil.
   When the Nazis cracked down on nonconformists, Berlin's artists
and independent intellectuals deserted the city.
   After the war, divided and desolate, Berlin became a backwater.
   West Berlin was an outpost of democracy in a sea of communism.
So many people fled to it from surrounding East German territory
that the Communist regime built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to keep
them in.
   The wall builders disregarded streets and subway lines, creating
an artificial strip through the city.
   ``It's a unique situation,'' Freyer said. ``A building boom will
occur to fix what happened due to the division.''
   During World War II, bombs razed the Adlon and most other
buildings in the city's historic center.
   Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's most famous prewar square, was cut in
two by the wall and became a vast no-man's land.
   A platform at Potsdamer Platz where U.S. presidents once peered
into East Berlin was an early Cold War symbol. It has been taken
down.
   Daimler-Benz, the industrial giant, wants the choicest piece of
real estate on Potsdamer Platz for a new headquarters.
   Foreign countries hope to recover embassy sites confiscated by
East Germany after the war.
   ``We have the right to the land where our embassy was before the
war,'' a senior French diplomat said. ``We would have to entirely
rebuild because it's grass now.''
   The French Embassy was across the Pariser Platz from the U.S.
Embassy and the Adlon.
   On the West Berlin side of the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag
waits silently. On Dec. 2, the two German legislatures will decide
whether to return a united German parliament to its original home.
   On Sunday mornings, groups of soccer players gather for pickup
games on the green expanse in front of the Reichstag, where Hitler
once addressed throngs of supporters.
   An army of rabbits that lived in the deserted area behind it has
invaded the meadows of the Tiergarten across the street.
