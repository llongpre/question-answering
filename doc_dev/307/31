</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss West Germany's offer of 
massive financial aid, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to 
German reunification and sharply criticized Westerners who suggest that 
socialism has failed. 
</P>
<P>
Activity on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate at dawn suggested that an 
early opening of the symbol of German unity as an East-West crossing point was 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no signs of construction work on the eastern side of the Berlin 
Wall, and West German police said their East German colleagues had told them 
not to expect an opening during the course of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the Brandenburg Gate is clearly a sensitive one for East Germany, given 
the symbolism of the six-column Grecian arch, scene of Prussian and Nazi 
triumphal parades. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are likely to be playing a significant role 
in East-West negotiations about opening the gate, which spans the main trunk 
road through the heart of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung 
that East Germany can manage its own economic recovery, an indication that 
Bonn's conditional aid offer may be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or external financial 
situation" of East Germany, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Bauern Echo, aimed at East Germany's farmers, warned 
of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout," the paper declared. 
"Yes to meeting again, no to reunification. The two German states are 
politically and economically too diverse." 
</P>
<P>
There was no official response from the government to West Germany's offer, 
which would require East Germany's ruling Communists to fundamentally reform 
their centrally planned economy. Communist officials have made it clear that 
they do not favor a full free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev for the second day warned Westerners not to expect German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking about reunification would mean interference in the affairs of West 
Germany and of the German Democratic Republic," Gorbachev said in a speech to a 
student meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said Westerners who claim the changes in the East signify the failure 
of socialism are engaging in "wishful thinking." He did not say who he was 
referring to. "We are expanding the potential of the socialist social system," 
he said.
