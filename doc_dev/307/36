   Former President Reagan, once lambasted by
angry demonstrators in divided Berlin, was hailed Tuesday as a
returning hero.
   On Wednesday, Reagan is to cross into East Berlin at the
Brandenburg Gate, where he gave a speech in 1987 challenging Moscow
to tear down the Berlin Wall. That visit was marred by
demonstrations by 25,000 people opposed to U.S. foreign policy.
   Now that East and West Germany are to reunite in October, the
atmosphere is transformed. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old saw only
cheerful faces in his brief contact with the public.
   About 100 Germans and foreign tourists gathered outside the
Bristol Kempinski Hotel to see Reagan and his wife Nancy leave for
a diplomatic dinner. They applauded and called for autographs.
   The Berliner Morgenpost daily welcomed Reagan's visit with a
headline saying his walk through the Brandenburg Gate will mean
``Reagan's Dream Fulfilled.''
   Reagan and his wife arrived in Berlin early in the day to open a
10-day European trip.
   During his 1987 visit, Reagan voiced skepticism about reforms
started by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He said the one
thing Moscow could do to advance the cause of peace would be to
dismantle the Berlin Wall.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate,'' Reagan said. ``Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.''
   The former Communist rulers of East Germany opened the wall in
November in one of their last, desperate acts to stay in power.
   On Wednesday, Reagan will travel about a mile into East Berlin
to meet with officials there _ now democratically elected.
