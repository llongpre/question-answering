   The big arm of the crane smashed into the
stacked slabs of concrete like a fist through a window, scattering
enough bits of Berlin Wall to fill a dozen souvenir stands.
   A small crowd lingered close to midnight Sunday to watch the
floodlit scene, wincing as a screeching, scraping array of machines
began clearing away the most famous section of the battered barrier.
   From this spot _ the gigantic Brandenburg Gate serving as a
breathtaking backdrop _ came the most vivid image of the collapse
of Communist East Germany.
   Thousands climbed the section of wall when the country's borders
were opened on Nov. 9, chipping away at the stretch of stone that
that was once an art gallery of political graffiti.
   ``I remember walking with my old mother here on Nov. 5 and
telling her that it won't be long before this wall is gone,'' said
West Berliner Hans Ulrich, 42, as he leaned on a guardrail and
watched the destruction.
   ``Of course, I'd been saying that for years.''
   When they built the wall around West Berlin nearly three decades
ago, Communist authorities put the most effort into the 575-foot
section that loops around the Brandenburg Gate. It was by far the
most heavily reinforced, a semi-circle of concrete slabs cemented
together and woven with heavy cable.
   With the 18th-century Brandenburg Gate the symbol of old Berlin,
this section of wall was the symbol of its division, splitting the
wide avenue that was once a main thoroughfare.
   After the wall was opened, a border crossing was cut into it at
Brandenburg Gate and the area became a major tourist attraction.
   Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything from Berlin Wall
keychains to membership pins worn by East Germany's notorious
former secret police.
   Much of the imaginative graffiti has been chiseled away by
souvenir hunters who place great value on paint-splashed pieces of
wall. New, post-revolution graffiti has taken its place.
   ``The wall is on its way to your hometown,'' read one comment.
   The new East German government has said it will remove all of
the 100-mile barrier that encircles West Berlin. A few weeks ago,
long sections adjacent the Brandenburg Gate were demolished.
   Late Saturday night, after most of the tourists had gone home, a
West German construction crew and East German soldiers began taking
down the section of wall directly in front of the gate.
   They planned to work only at night, completing the removal
within a week. Officials say they hope to restore auto traffic down
the divided street.
   About 400 people watched Sunday night as a giant jackhammer
hooked to the end of a crane continued the slow battle against the
wall's most formidable stretch.
   ``It is a symbol, but it kept people apart,'' said East Berliner
Fabian Evers, 18, as he sold chunks of wall on a blanket near the
gate. ``It is an ideological statement to tear it down.''
   Ulricht, a school teacher, said he has no desire to see this
part of the wall remain as a memorial.
   ``This section was a symbol not only of the division of Berlin
and Germany, but of East and West Europe,'' he said. ``I enjoy very
much that this wall is coming down.''
