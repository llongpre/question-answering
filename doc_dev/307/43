   The warming trend between East and West has
had a positive side-effect for foreigners, with visitors no longer
required to hand over a minimum of $14 for each day of their stay
in East Germany
   Under an aid agreement with Bonn, East Germany has ended its
age-old ``Zwangsumtausch,'' or the ``forced exchange'' that aimed
to increase the socialist state's hard-currency coffers.
   Officials from the two nations announced in December that West
Germans would no longer be required to make the minimum conversion
after Jan. 1. The extension of the benefit to other foreigners has
come as a surprise.
   ``We've heard that was the case, but we have nothing official on
it yet,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner commented when
asked if U.S. authorities had been informed of the change.
   Tourists from the United States, France, Great Britain and other
nations required to enter East Germany through Checkpoint Charlie
have found empty money exchange booths at that border crossing.
   No public announcement of the policy change has been made, but
East German officials confirmed Friday that all visitors can enter
free of charge.
   Franz Koeckerbauer, spokesman for the Finance Ministry, said
border authorities stopped demanding the exchange minimum on Dec.
23 when the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961, was opened at the
historic Brandenburg Gate. Hundreds of thousands poured through the
new opening in the wall to make the towering gate accessible to
pedestrians from East and West Berlin.
   East Germany's ADN news agency reported that 3.7 million people
passed between East and West Berlin over the New Year's holiday
weekend, although it did not indicate if that figure included an
estimate of the thousands who simply scaled the graffiti-splattered
wall rather than using designated border crossings.
   Bernd Schroeter, a spokesman for East Germany's state bank, said
the decision to suspend minimum currency exchange requirements for
all visitors was connected with the agreement reached with West
Germany in early December.
   Under the deal agreed to by Communist Premier Hans Modrow and
Rudolf Seiters, the chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bonn
is financing a special hard-currency fund for East Germans in
exchange for ending the conversion minimum for West Germans.
   Schroeter said the West German measures compensating East
Germany for the lost revenue extended to the entire fund, not just
the revenue from West Germans.
   Western diplomats estimate that East Germany earned between $294
million and $441 million annually from forced conversion.
   Schroeter said he could not estimate what percentage of the
total came from foreigners other than West Germans.
   Visitors are forbidden to take East German marks with them when
they leave the country, so in the past much of the currency was
left behind with friends or relatives, or squandered at overpriced
restaurants.
   Under the new currency exchange rules, foreigners can change
their hard currencies at a rate that gives them three times as many
East German marks as under the old system _ but only if they want
to.
