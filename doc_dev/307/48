   They came by the millions, pouring through the new
gaps in the Berlin Wall, rejoicing in the simple ability to move
freely in their city for the first time in nearly three decades.
   When East Germany suddenly announced on Nov. 9, 1989 that it was
opening its borders, I witnessed an outpouring of joy that became
the biggest party Berlin has ever seen.
   It was nearly 7 p.m. when the stunning announcement was made at
a news conference in East Berlin.
   I jumped into a car and toured several border crossings at the
wall. Confused guards on both sides still could not say exactly
when unhindered passage would be allowed.
   As midnight approached, thousands of East Germans massed on the
eastern side of the barrier that symbolized the Cold War. At
midnight, they rushed through crossing points, some on foot, some
in sputtering Trabant cars.
   West Berliners greeted them with champagne, tapping on the roofs
of the cars in boisterous welcome.
   At Checkpoint Charlie, Germans from both sides kissed, cried for
joy and danced. Relatives embraced for the first time in a
generation.
   I saw East German border guards transformed in minutes from
dour, arrogant guardians of communism into friendly helpers,
smiling and chatting with West Berlin police. They even stopped
checking documents.
   Hundreds of people danced atop the wal at the Brandenburg Gate
in one of the most memorable scenes of that incredible Thursday
night.
   By 2 a.m., West Berlin was one gigantic party. Thousands of
people streamed along the glittering Kurfuerstendamm outside the
Associated Press office.
   Authorities had closed the street to traffic and it became a sea
of people, ebbing and flowing in the chilly night to marvel at the
wonders of capitalism.
   A giant screen on a department store alternated announcements
that the wall was open with flashes of ``Welcome, Welcome'' to the
visitors from the east.
   Hardly anyone slept in Berlin. Bars stayed open through the
night, offering free drinks to East Germans.
   At 5 a.m., I set out on the 10-minute walk from the AP office to
my hotel, and spent nearly an hour wading through the dancing and
singing crowds. Strangers hugged me. Others handed me paper cups
filled with champagne.
   At 8 a.m., I watched the East Germans open a large section of
the wall at Bernauer Strasse, where some of the most spectacular
escapes and bloody failures had taken place.
   That weekend, Berlin became one, months before the official
reunification of Germany.
