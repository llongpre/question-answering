   The battle-scarred sandstone columns of the
Brandenburg Gate, which were the backdrop for Hitler's last stand
and a workers' uprising against Communism in 1953, once again tower
over the stage of history.
   The 200-year-old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, has stood
as the symbol of German division for 28 years.
   With the Berlin Wall quickly crumbling, the gate is being called
the symbol of German unity. It also has been the backdrop for much
of the television coverage beamed around the world in the past week
of fast-moving developments.
   East Germany has said it is considering opening a Berlin Wall
border crossing at the Brandenburg Gate. There was wide speculation
in West Berlin that an opening would be knocked through the wall
Thursday, although there was no official confirmation.
   The gate _ the size of a five-story building _ remained on the
Eastern side when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The famous
Unten den Linden boulevard ends at the gate.
   On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to the gate
was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the workers' uprising
in East Berlin in 1953 that was bloodily crushed by Soviet tanks.
   East Berlin workers, angered by the nationalization and
collectivization policies of the Communist government, began their
street demonstrations at the Brandenburg Gate and tore down the red
flag from the top of the gate.
   In the closing days of World War II, Soviet tanks rumbled by the
gate as they closed in on Adolf Hitler's bunker in the chancellery.
Only a few hundred yards away was the heart of Hitler's government
in a small complex on Wilhelmstrasse, which also served as the seat
of the imperial government. The Reichstag also is not far away.
   The Brandenburg Gate also marked Hitler's rise to power. Nazi
brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the gate when
Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   Built from 1788 to 1791 by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the
six-column gate was commissioned by Prussian King Frederick Wilhelm
II. When it was built, it opened the road to the region of
Brandenburg, getting its name.
   The gate was modeled after the Acropolis in Athens to reflect
the king's intention to make Berlin a city of learning and arts.
   On top of the gate is a bronze chariot with the goddess
Victoria. It was hauled away to Paris when Napoleon defeated the
Prussians at Jena and Auerstadt on Oct. 27, 1806. He marched into
Berlin through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The chariot was brought back to Berlin after Napoleon's defeat
in 1814. After the Franco-German war in 1870-71, the victorious
Prussians made a triumphal return to Berlin, the new imperial
capital, again through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The gate was heavily damaged in the last days of World War II
and marked the border between the Soviet and British sectors of
conquered Berlin.
   It was restored between 1956 and 1958. The chariot was repaired
and paid for by West Berlin under Mayor Willy Brandt, but East
Berlin authorities removed the Prussian eagle and the iron cross
from Victoria's staff before mounting it again.
   In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the
gate to prevent President John F. Kennedy from looking into East
Berlin when he visited West Berlin and delivered his ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech.
   The gate, the last of the 20 gates to Berlin still standing, is
66 feet high, 215 feet wide and 36 feet deep.
