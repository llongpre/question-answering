   West German protesters threw tomatoes and eggs at
East German guards at the Berlin Wall and communist police hauled
away protesting East German youths Saturday as both sides marked
the barrier's 27th anniversary.
   West Berlin politicians and peace groups lay wreaths during
solemn ceremonies at memorials for the 77 East Germans reported
killed in escape attempts to the West.
   West German newspapers condemned the wall, with one of them
calling it ``a monstrosity.''
   But Communist East Germany's state-controlled newspapers
celebrated the wall's construction and said it contributed to
East-West peace.
   Dozens of West German activists demonstrated in front of the
Brandenburg Gate, a stone gateway directly behind the wall in the
eastern sector. They carried life-sized portraits of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and called on the Soviet leader to pressure East Germany
to tear down the wall.
   In its evening broadcast, West Germany's ZDF television network
showed a handful of East German youths being taken away by East
Berlin police after trying to protest near the wall. The protest
appeared to have been dispersed peacefully.
   About a dozen young people from West Berlin protested late
Friday night at the ``Checkpoint Charlie'' control point between
East and West Berlin, witnesses said, hurling tomatoes and eggs at
guards on the eastern side.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
demonstrators left peacefully after British military police were
called in.
   East German border guards began hastily constructing the 13-foot
wall on Aug. 13, 1961, dividing the city into Eastern and Western
halves. Orders to construct the wall came as the rising flow of
East German refugees to the West threatened to cripple the
Communist nation's economy.
   The official East German explanation for the wall was that it
was needed to prevent a planned attack from the West.
   The East German youth newspaper Junge Welt said in its Saturday
editions the wall was built because ``those who oppose fascism once
promised: No more wars from German territory.''
   Another East German newspaper, Berliner Zeitung, said of the day
construction began: ``As the day dawned, the border was made safe.''
   West German commentators sharply denounced the wall.
   ``People who are in their 30s have grown up with this
monstrosity,'' the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper said. ``It belongs
to their everyday lives ... but the wall is still a horror in a
civilized world.
   ``The wall is also a test for the true value of Gorbachev's
reforms,'' the newspaper said. ``As long as this monstrosity is
standing, Gorbachev's words are only words.''
   Another West German newspaper, the mass-circulation daily Bild,
said in a commentary: ``Today, 27 years later, we speak of ... new
openness and reforms in the East. But the wall still stands _
inhumanity cast in stone, bondage poured into cement.''
   In Washington on Friday, President Reagan called the Berlin Wall
``dramatic proof of communism's failed dream.''
   ``Aug. 13 marks a sad anniversary,'' Reagan said in a statement.
``That wall is a both a scar across the city of Berlin and a symbol
of the division of the German nation and of Europe.''
   Today, armed East German guards patrol the wall around the
clock, and floodlights illuminate it at night.
   The August 13th Working Group, a West Berlin organization that
monitors human rights in East Germany, says 77 people have been
killed in escape attempts from East Berlin since the wall was put
up.
   The last reported death came on May 23, 1987, when a lifeless
body was carried away from the Wall on the East Berlin side.
