   Poles have poured into Berlin by the tens of
thousands, packing buses, jamming trains and sputtering along in
tiny cars. Their goal: one last, mad shopping spree to get Western
goods before German unification.
   Poles could freely come to East Germany and then pass unhindered
into the consumer nirvana of West Berlin. But at midnight today
East Germany won't exist and Poles and others will have to meet
rigorous visa requirements.
   Others seeking a quick profit in Berlin's frantic days before
unification were East European gypsies, a few Soviets, Germans and
even an enterprising Afghan.
   The Poles were especially noticeable on downtown streets Monday.
   There were Poles pulling baggage carts loaded with stereos,
video equipment, television sets and boom boxes.
   Rushing through Berlin's hectic streets, the Poles pushed their
goods and loaded them into dozens and dozens of waiting buses
parked along broad avenues.
   Berliners sat in outdoor cafes despite an uncomfortable wind and
threatening dark clouds.
   They seemed subdued compared with the euphoria of the days in
November when the Berlin Wall was opened. Millions of East Germans
then poured across the border and West Berlin's streets were a
circus of consumerism.
   But the most cosmopolitan of German cities was still enjoying
the show on Monday, throbbing with life as it prepared to become
Germany's capital, the biggest city between Paris and Moscow.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of tourists browsed through
the bazaar that has mushroomed along the former ``death strip''
that separated East and West.
   An Afghan sold his native-country rugs, East German soldiers'
fur aps, Soviet-made watches and Islamic literature.
   The symbols of an outdated ideology and its military might were
being auctioned off at the once-forbidding Cold War barrier.
   A German was peddling East German flags, Soviet army belts and a
large blue, gold-edged banner that said, `Always Ready for Peace
and Socialism.''
   Next to him, two Soviets were offering records of Lenin's
thoughts, excerpts from speeches by their late hard-line leader
Leonid Brezhnev, and heroic martial songs performed by the Red Army
choir.
   At row after row of stands, Eastern European gypsies were doing
brisk a business in Soviet military belts, spy glasses,
night-vision infra-red binoculars, pistol holsters, East German
army helmets and Soviet and East German uniforms.
   A Soviet woman was unloading a bagfull of red Lenin banners to a
gypsy seller. Another group of Soviets was selling Lenin pins to a
group of Americans.
   Above the crowd, television technicians used cranes to hoist
floodlights in preparation for unification, which comes at the
stroke of midnight.
   Asian manufacturers of electronics will be celebrating German
unification too; their countries are receiving another boost to
their bulging trade surpluses.
   West Berlin merchants were struggling to meet the demand on
Monday as Poles scrambled to beat the imposition of visas that will
come with unification.
   To get visas, Poles will have to have 50 marks (about $30) for
every day they plan to spend in Germany and will have to show they
have medical insurance coverage for their stay.
   Across from the seedy Zoo train station, a truck was unloading
TV sets. Impatient Poles were crowding around the truck. A worker
wiped his sweaty brow and begged for space so that he could carry
the packed sets into the store.
   In front of the City Radio store, ropes were put up to form
lines. The stereos, the TV sets, the videos never got unpacked as
scores of Poles snapped them up.
   Polish cars took nearly all parking spaces around the station,
and in some of them weary shoppers took naps. Families took breaks,
sitting on boxes of newly bought stereo equipment.
   Others fanned across the city to search for their buses. Perhaps
hundreds were parked along the broad avenues leading to the
Brandenburg Gate, even blocking the view to the Bellevue Palace,
the official residence of German presidents.
   Thousands went back to Poland in train cars packed with people,
food and the latest in electronic gear.
   One man pushed a supermarket cart on top of which a huge TV set,
too big to fit into the cart, swayed precariously, tied with a
rope.
   One woman took off her shoes and lay across several boxes
containing stereos. A large grocery bag served as her pillow.
