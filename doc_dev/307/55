<LEADPARA>  IT SHOULD come as no surprise that Germany is making peace the same way it
used to make war -- very quickly, very efficiently.;    It has been less than
a year since East and West Germany were reunited, and less than two years
since those incredible days in November 1989 when the Berlin Wall started
tumbling down. The changes in what used to be East Berlin have been dramatic,
sometimes staggering. It is not the same case in the other parts of eastern
Germany, but even there, the march of westernization is obviously under way.; 
  The signs of the new Germany hit you immediately after you cross what used
to be the old border. At almost every rest stop or pullout space along the
autobahn from Hamburg to the Berlin suburbs, eager capitalists have set up
food stands or small mobile trailers where passing motorists can grab a
bratwurst or beer. This is the same highway where two years ago the only place
to stop was a dreary roadside cafe or two.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I remember buying a Coke as I passed by this way once back in the dark
days; it was a horrid mixture made from terrible-tasting syrup and suspicious
water. The paper cup dissolved in a few minutes, and the food was socialist
terrible. The roadside stalls now have icy drinks, Western cigarettes, real
Coke in cans and smiling service. A small thing perhaps, but one of great
impact on your memories.;    The other great signs of change along the highway
are the guard towers. Once filled with sullen men watching every passing car
through binoculars, sitting along the autobahns like evil castles, the towers
are empty now. The barbed wire is gone, the checkpoints have been torn up, and
the signs warning motorists not to stray from designated routes are gone as
well. It is now common for passing motorists to slow a bit and make obscene
gestures at the towers. We tried it; it felt great.;    It is not surprising
that East Berlin has begun to change as rapidly as it has. Even in the years
when the wall divided the city, East Berliners had a taste or two of what was
happening in the West. TV signals know no boundaries, and at night, some in
East Berlin could see the neon and hear the furor coming from the manic
streets of West Berlin.;    The eastern side of the city is changing so
rapidly, in fact, that it might be smart for anyone owning a store along the
Kufurstendamm, West Berlin's major downtown artery, to move, immediately, to
somewhere near the Unter den Linden, East Berlin's main drag.;    East Berlin,
despite war damage and socialist oppression, has always had the potential of
being the most beautiful part of a reunited city. Its great churches, museums
and classic Prussian edifices will, once completely restored, make the area
around the Brandenburg Gate and the Unter den Linden one of the most beautiful
in all Europe.;    (Unless the often-sleazy glitter of West Berlin is allowed
to move in. In which case, the city should be given back to the communists
until somebody with a sense of style takes over.);    Just up
Friedrichstrasse, where Checkpoint Charlie used to sit, are a bunch of
buildings that two years ago represented the spirit of the German Democratic
Republic. Before, when you cleared the often-nasty inspection of East German
border guards and started your uneasy walk into East Berlin toward Unter den
Linden, these are what you spotted first. Drab, unpainted, dreary, soulless,
most unchanged from the days in 1945 when the Russians came to occupy Hitler's
capital.;    In two years, some have been torn down, but most are being
rehabilitated at breakneck pace. Bullet-pocked walls are being plastered over,
19th-century relics are being restored to their former glory, broken windows
are being replaced. The drab is being replaced with capitalist zest.;    On
the ground floor of an old building that stands maybe 100 yards from the
eastern side of Checkpoint Charlie, there is a brand new Mercedes-Benz
dealership. Where once nothing was for sale, those passing by can check out a
$90,000 Benz.;    Noise and laughter;  Across the street, there is a boutique
selling $100-a-bottle French perfume. Cafes, once filled only with silent,
slump-shouldered men, are packed with noise and laughter. Tourists mix with
Germans, traffic jams the streets, street cars are stuffed with people heading
into West Berlin, where once you were lucky if you saw 10 people aboard.;   
The greatest symbol of the division of East and West Berlin, the wall, the
hated wall, is gone, banged and cracked and chipped into a million pieces,
grabbed up by souvenir hunters or carted off by hordes of sidewalk venders
selling chunks to eager tourists near the Brandenburg Gate. (Make sure you
wait till the paint dries.) Except for one length of wall, all that remains
are a narrow ditch or broken pavement where the wall was torn out. Grass will
soon cover the scars.;    Across the river Spree from the Reichstag, the old
seat of German government, is what used to be, two years ago, a no-man's land.
The wall there, in contrast with the garishly painted stretches of wall on the
West Berlin side, was bare, ugly concrete.;    A memorial; Today, it is
painted, but in stark black and white, a moving testimony to the several
hundred people who died trying to cross it to freedom, 100 yards of former
deadly barrier adorned with works of art symbolizing the repression of the
communist government. In the middle, a dove of peace caught in the branches of
oppression; to the side, figures in agony reaching toward the sky, searching
for freedom. And along one long section, a series of black vertical bars with
dates showing the number of people killed trying to escape to the West from
1945 to 1989.;    Chances are, the German government will soon move the
capital from Bonn back to Berlin and take up residence again in the Reichstag.
The nation's leaders can look out their windows, over the Spree, and see the
new Berlin wall. This one might last.;    But the rapidity of the changes in
Berlin, as well as the rest of Germany and the other new democracies of
Eastern Europe, carries some very real human costs.;    For East Germans
coping with the sudden influx of Western goods, freedom is a mixed bag. It's
one thing to be able to live in a free society where you can look at a $90,000
automobile, but quite another to be able to even come close to buying it.;   
A case in point is an East German we heard about who was able, after waiting
several years, to buy a new Trabant, one of those small, plastic, horribly
inefficient East German cars. It's common to see them lined up on the streets
and highways in East Germany while their drivers try to get them going again.;
   50-mark lemons;  He paid the equivalent of several years' wages to buy the
car. Now, less than two years later, used Trabants are selling for 50 marks in
East Berlin -- about $27.;    Before reunification, the East German government
automatically registered cars and issued plates and insurance. Now, East
Germans are learning to cope with their own DMV. There are so many Trabant
owners getting rid of their lemons that whole legions of young Berliners, once
years away from car ownership, are snapping them up. But consider the rude
shock they have after putting up 50 marks for a car to discover that a year's
insurance on their new heap also costs 50 marks.;    The Trabant factory
closed a few months ago, putting 3,500 employees out of work. And the same
thing is happening all over East Germany as the new democracy struggles to
bring its eastern side into the modern, industrialized world. There have been
protests and strikes, some violent, as the euphoria of reunification dissolves
into the harsh reality of economic reorganization.;    For tourists used to
the ease and efficiency of West Germany, travel in the East still has its
uncertainties. In the West, it is almost a certainty that hotel rooms will be
clean and well-equipped. Dropping into a cafe or restaurant in Frankfurt or
Heidelberg almost always means fast service and good food. There are plenty of
gas stations. The trains are new and clean. The stores have things to buy.;   
New to service;  This is not yet so in the East. Having had virtually no
tourists passing through for the last half-century, East Germany is not yet
prepared to offer the level of service expected in the rest of the country.
Hotels in big cities tend to be holdovers from the days when the East German
government owned them all (expensive, rudimentary, depressing) and small
hotels, when you can find them, are often fairly crude.;    Some things are
the same -- good wurst, good beer -- but truly excellent restaurants haven't
yet arrived. The cities, such as Dresden, still have the faint odor of
hopelessness hanging around. The streets are dull and drab, the stores still
mostly unstocked, Mercedes Benzes and BMWs are few and far between.;    Things
will probably change quickly once tourists start rediscovering some of the
wonders that have been locked in the East these last 50 years. A bit of spit
and polish here and there, a can of paint, some new glass, maybe a couple of
dozen new power plants. And a final understanding that the way they lived, a
nation apart, is now seemingly gone forever -- and soon, the wound that tore
them apart might heal.;    Berliners call the miracle of 1989 die Wende, the
Change. And the way the tentacles of that change are rapidly slithering into
all parts of the East might be called die Blitzfriede -- the lightning peace.
If there is one thing that free Germans seem to have in abundance, it is the
capacity and temperament to get the job done, fast and right.;    It took the
Russians 50 years to sink Eastern Europe into the deplorable state it is in
today. Odds are, Germany -- all of Germany -- will be back among the living
before the end of the decade. If you want to see the leftovers of what used to
be dark and sinister East Germany, you'd better hurry. The autobahns -- and
all they mean -- are on the way.;    The old East Berlin, as depressing as it
was, was a shining light compared to other parts of eastern Germany. Driving
south from Berlin toward Dresden, one sees dreary countryside. The air is
filled with stifling coal smoke, the small villages are rude and shabby, the
road is full of smoke-belching Trabants sputtering their way along at a top
speed of 60 miles an hour.;    The autobahn is dreadful. For those who have
driven on the high-speed freeways of West Germany, arguably the best super
highways in the world, the roads in East Germany show you how far apart the
two societies were and how far they have to go. Buckled, rutted, chuck-holed,
battered. In places the already bad pavement gives way to ancient bricks, left
over from the days when the Third Reich created the autobahn system.;    It is
inconceivable that a modern German society would tolerate an autobahn in such
condition, given that the Germans produce some of the best high-performance
cars in the world and demand highways to accept them. So it is no surprise to
note that alongside the battered Berlin-Dresden autobahn, new pavement is
being laid in long, smooth, efficient West German-style stretches.;    The
road to freedom in East Germany might be arduous, but it will at least be well
paved.; COMING UP: Travel Editor Zeke Wigglesworth is on the road to
Czechoslovakia. Next week, the story of the pink Panzer in Prague.  </TEXT>
