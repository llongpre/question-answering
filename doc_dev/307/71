<HEAD>East German President Says Wall Superfluous, Will Be Dismantled</HEAD>

   East German President Manfred
Gerlach says the Berlin Wall is ``superfluous'' and will eventually
be dismantled, a West Germany newspaper reported today.
   East German officials previously have suggested that the barrier
be retained, at least in part, to prevent smuggling and the spread
of drugs, the AIDS virus and other social problems.
   ``We are tearing down the wall,'' the mass-circulation Bild
newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying.
   ``It is superfluous,'' Gerlach said of the wall, according to
Bild. ``It will be replaced with normal border markings.''
   Gerlach said he could not predict when the wall, erected in 1961
to stem an exodus of East German workers to the West, would be
taken down.
   Visiting Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel told reporters
Tuesday that Gerlach had said the dismantling of the wall already
has begun, referring to the more than two dozen crossings punched
through it in the past two months.
   East Germany lifted travel restrictions for its citizens on Nov.
9, unleashing a joyous rush by millions to the West for visits and
celebrations in the divided city.
   A new crossing near the historic Brandenburg Gate was opened
Dec. 23, facilitating the first joint New Year's celebration in 40
years.
