   Until Sunday, one of the most poignant sights in
this city scarred by enmity was that of the rusting tram lines
running under the Berlin Wall in West Berlin at Potsdamer Platz.
   From a wooden platform nearby, visitors peering over the grim
concrete barricade could see what had become of the square that
once was the vibrant city center _ the Times Square or Picadilly
Circus of central Europe.
   A vast death strip dotted with concrete watchtowers had replaced
the cafes where playwright Bertolt Brecht caroused in the 1920s.
   Where bustling Berliners once traded and changed trams, there
was only an eerie emptiness and silence.
   On Sunday, the silence and some of the ghostly atmosphere lifted
as East German soldiers removed enough slabs from either side of
the no-man's-land to allow the mayors of East and West Berlin, and
then thousands of their citizens, to meet.
   For the first time since the wall blocked them 28 years ago, the
tram lines could be seen in full, running through into East Berlin
on a cobbled street that survived both Adolf Hitler's war and the
ensuing Cold War.
   ``Perhaps,'' mused an East Berlin woman wistfully as she waited
in the gray mist to cross to the West, ``perhaps there'll be a tram
line running here again soon.''
   Only a week ago, that was inconceivable.
   ``We want to look through the Brandenburg Gate from the other
side,'' said East Berliner Wolfgang Rosenloecher, standing with his
wife Monika.
   ``Just last week, we were walking there, saying to ourselves
perhaps we'll get there before we are pensioners. But we never
thought it would happen so quickly.''
   Rosenloecher, 62, came here many times between 1951 and 1961,
when the wall was built. ``This was where the drivers of the trams
changed, between the Western and Eastern zones. Over there,'' he
pointed into the no-man's-land on either side of the wall, ``that
was the market where the easterners could buy stuff in their
currency.''
   ``And of course,'' he sighed, ``Potsdamer Platz was one of the
places where the most happened on June 17.''
   On that day in 1953, Soviet tanks rumbled over the cobblestones
to crush a workers' revolt against East Germany's Communist
government.
   On Sunday, such cruel memories were in the past.
   East Berlin's mayor Erhard Krack walked past the dismembered
slabs of the wall into West Berlin and shook hands with his West
Berlin counterpart, Wolfgang Momper.
   In contrast to the quiet, orderly crowd of about 1,000 on the
eastern side, the 10,000 or so in West Berlin were in noisy high
spirits.
   ``Let us in! We want to go and have breakfast on the Alex!''
they cried, referring to the Alexanderplatz square in downtown East
Berlin.
   Hundreds climbed the wall and swarmed into the former death
strip. Watched by bemused East German border guards, a long-haired
``rocker'' dressed in black leather careened around, shouting ``I
can't believe it! The Wall has gone!''
   Hundreds of impatient easterners left to seek another less
crowded crossing.
   Rosenloecher and his wife didn't budge. ``We used to use every
opportunity we could to look across to the West, climbing the high
apartment houses ... or to the top of the cathedral,'' said Mrs.
Rosenloecher. ``We can wait now.''
