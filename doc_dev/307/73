   East Germans starting new lives on the
western side of the Berlin Wall feasted on turkey, cranberry sauce
and stuffing Thursday, joining American soldiers for a mess hall
Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``We're sharing our holiday with the East Germans,'' said Maj.
Terrence Meehan, public relations officer for the Berlin Brigade.
``We're extending the hand of friendship.''
   For dessert, besides pumpkin pie and hard candies, there were
horns of plenty spilling over with apples, bananas, grapes and
oranges set in front of a scale model of the Brandenburg Gate
behind a tiny graffiti-covered Berlin Wall.
   ``I never had such a nice dinner. I never saw such a variety of
food,'' said Beate Chilla, who arrived Wednesday from East Berlin
with her husband and their two young sons. ``And everything's
decorated so nicely for the children.''
   Paper napkins and tablecloths featuring orange and brown
drawings of turkeys covered the mess hall tables at Andrews
Barracks, a U.S. base on the southern outskirts of West Berlin.
   Dozens of recent East German immigrants were bused from the
city's Marienfelde reception camp to several U.S. Army dining
halls, including 49 who crowded in with American soldiers and their
families at Andrews.
   ``It's really a symbolic effort limited by the capacity of the
facilities,'' Meehan said. Just providing special meals to American
soldiers and their families already makes Thanksgiving Day a busy
one for the mess halls, he said.
   More than 275,000 East Germans have arrived this year in West
Germany and West Berlin. The flood of refugees fleeing West through
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary forced the Communist leadership
to lift travel restrictions Nov. 9.
   Since then, the vast majority of the millions of East Germans
who flocked across to visit the West have returned home _ but not
all of them.
   In the past two weeks, more than 40,000 East Germans have
declared their intention to stay in the West, the Bonn government
says.
   Hans-Juergen Eichler, digging into some ham and cranberry sauce,
said he had been seeking permission for two years to emigrate with
his wife and 15-year-old son, but was refused because of his
backing for illegal environmental and human rights groups in East
Germany.
   His wife, Petra, had been allowed twice to visit her grandmother
in West Germany, but Hans-Juergen never crossed the Berlin Wall
until Dec. 10, when he joined at least a million other East Germans
crowding into West Berlin for a look around.
   Under the new rules, it was easy to get permission to emigrate,
and the Eichlers left for good on Wednesday, going to the
Marienfelde camp for help in resettling.
   ``We didn't come for material things. We didn't like the
military way over there,'' said Eichler, wiping thick gravy from
his droopy light-brown mustache.
   In East Berlin, Eichler's job involved placing advertisements on
state railroad trains, but he said he was ready to try anything now.
   ``I will take whatever I can get,'' he said. ``I don't want to
be too selective. The most important thing is to start our lives
over again.''
