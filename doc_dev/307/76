<LEADPARA>  The victory goddess is back in her chariot atop the famed Brandenburg Gate in
the heart of Berlin -- complete with a scepter bearing a controversial iron
cross and eagle. Workers using large cranes placed the copper sculpture back
on top of the 65-foot-high gate on Monday. It had been removed in March 1990
for repairs. When the Berlin Wall stood, the gate was in East German territory
and the Communists ordered the iron cross and eagle removed. Now some are
unhappy about their restoration, saying they symbolize Germany's former
warlike tendencies.  </LEADPARA>
