   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy departed for Berlin on
Monday to tour the newly opened Berlin Wall and cross into East
Germany 26 years after his brother's historic ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech.
   Kennedy, the first high-ranking U.S. official to plan a visit to
the wall since East Germans were allowed to stream through to the
West, was to meet Tuesday with former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   It was Brandt who, as mayor of West Berlin, greeted President
John F. Kennedy on June 26, 1963, the day Kennedy spoke to a throng
blocks from the wall dividing East from West.
   ``I think all of us have watched in awe in recent weeks as a new
spirit of freedom has swept throughout Eastern Europe and nowhere
is this spirit greater than in Berlin,'' Kennedy said in an
interview before catching his flight at Logan International Airport.
   The senator said he was going to pay tribute not only to his
brother's visit in 1963 but ``to the spirit of the people who have
kept the spirit alive.''
   Sen. Kennedy planned no major address in Berlin but was
scheduled to deliver remarks at a memorial to his brother at the
Berlin City Hall.
   ``He's going for personal, not political reasons,'' said Kennedy
spokesman Paul Donovan.
   After a visit to the Brandenburg Gate and a visit at a memorial
to those killed trying to cross over the wall, Kennedy planned to
cross into East Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie, most famous of the
once heavily guarded border crossing points. Donovan said Kennedy
planned to hold private meetings with East German officials.
   Kennedy, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is
also visiting Geneva and Brussels for meetings on defense-related
matters.
   John Kennedy's speech, two years after construction of the wall,
reaffirmed the support of the West for citizens of the blockaded
city. It ended with the declaration that in the free world it was a
symbol of honor to declare ``I am a Berliner.''
   Kennedy's speech was seen as a high point in his presidency and
as a touchstone of the Cold War for its clear delineation of the
difference in personal liberties between East and West.
