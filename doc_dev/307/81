   For many weary East German workers, the Oct.
14 unification date set by their government Tuesday is far too late.
   ``It should happen more quickly. We all want to work but our
government can't do anything,'' said construction worker Horst
Schwaebisch.
   Earlier, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere announced that
leaders of parliamentary factions had agreed to the Oct. 14 date.
However, a political squabble later threatened to torpedo the
agreement, and one of East Germany's parties said it would push for
earlier unification.
   From the rusty bridge they were repairing, Schwaebisch and his
crew could see the West German flag flutter atop the Reichstag, the
historic site of the German parliament.

   Elsewhere in East Berlin, many expressed a similar opinion.
   But other East Germans questioned at random said things were in
fact going too fast, and they criticized the prime minister.
   ``Everything is happening in such a chaotic way. We could lose
our protection if we are just run over by West Germany,'' said
Heidi Loll, a nurse attending a protest by health care workers in
downtown East Berlin.
   ``Everything is falling apart. De Maiziere should leave politics
to real politicians,'' Ms. Kuhn added.
   Others expressed similar fears.
   ``They still have some issues to solve. Like how the economy
should be run. It's happening too fast,'' said Frank Stemmler, 27,
a former cook who now sells newspapers.
   Rapid unification delighted citizens of East Germany's Warsaw
Pact allies.
   ``The German nation should be together. The Berlin Wall is now
just a souvenir,'' said Alexei Baltyan, a worker from the Ukraine.
``There will be too many conflicts if they don't do it quickly.''
   A Ukrainian tourist had similar feelings.
   ``The quicker the better. After all, they are free now to
decide,'' said Vladimir Fedus, a worker from Lvov.
   One Polish entrepeneur agreed.
   ``It's very good. What else can I say?'' said the Pole, as he
rented hammers to tourists wanting to chip away at what is left of
the wall near the Brandenburg Gate.
