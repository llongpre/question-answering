   Forty-five years after Soviet troops dealt a
fatal blow to the Third Reich in the streets of this city, Germans
are drawing up plans for bringing the capital of a united Germany
back to Berlin.
   West Germans on Sunday were caught up in reunification euphoria
after an elated Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned from Moscow with
what he called ``a green light for the unity of our fatherland.''
   Dismissed as a nostalgic dream just four months ago, German
unification has become increasingly likely. Kohl says the historic
step could come by the end of this year.
   Kohl led a champagne toast ``to Germany'' on board his crowded
jetliner heading back to Bonn after talks in Moscow with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The West German leader made it clear that the World War II
Allies _ France, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union _
will have a key role in shaping unification plans along with the
two German states.
   Still, West Germany faces numerous financial and other
challenges as it attempts to unite its renowned wealth with the
nearly collapsed economy of East Germany, where the collapse of
Communist rule has virtually crippled the government.
   ``The Federal Republic (West Germany) is facing an economic
adventure,'' commented the ZDF television network. ``No one can
predict just how much the joining will cost. But it's certain that
in the areas of unemployment benefits, pensions and medical costs,
West Germans will be asked to make sacrifices in the billions.''
   The increasingly rapid turn of events has focused attention on
Berlin, which many regard as the true German capital. East Berlin
is the capital of East Germany, although the Western Allies insist
that violates post-war agreements. Bonn is the capital of West
Germany.
   After weeks of being skeptical about unification, West Berlin's
leftist-led city government said Sunday it will begin working with
East Berlin officials to prepare the entire city to become the
capital of a united Germany.
   West Berlin planning chief Michaela Schreyer announced that
``several models will be developed for the increasingly probable
case'' of making the city the capital.
   She said buildings must be sought for use by embassies,
government agencies and delegations from German states. The stately
Reichstag building near the Brandenburg Gate is expected to serve
as the Parliament building.
   Planners in both the East and West have their work cut out for
them.
   With a total of about 3 million residents on both sides of the
city, Berlin already is overcrowded and heavy smog drifts over the
city from surrounding East Germany.
   Housing in the West is extremely scarce, and the situation will
only get worse if tens of thousands people including lawmakers,
support staff, diplomats, lobbyists and national organizations
arrive in search of places to live.
   The only possibilities for suburban expansion are in surrounding
East Germany, but builders would have to start from scratch there
in constructing new homes and apartments. Berlin is located 100
miles inside East Germany.
   The World War II allies still have control over Berlin, once the
Nazi capital and later the site of the Cold War showdown that led
to the Berlin Wall.
   Ms. Schreyer promised to work with the Allies in preparing for
the return of the capital.
   ``After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is now necessary to
overcome the walls in our heads and to start to plan for Berlin as
a whole,'' Ms. Schreyer said in a statement to the news media.
   Sports officials are already pressing to make Berlin the site of
a future Olympic Games.
   Suggestions abound to hold international meetings and
conferences in the city to symbolize the improvements in East-West
relations.
   The growing focus on Berlin has led to mounting concerns in
Bonn, which was a sleepy Rhine River city before it was turned into
West Germany's ``provisional'' capital 41 years ago with the defeat
of the Nazis.
   Hildegard-Hamm Bruecher, a leading member of the Free Democrats
party, has demanded an immediate halt to government building
projects in Bonn.
   ``Further construction in what is still the capital cannot be
justified given the rapid pace of change in German-German
relations,'' she told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
