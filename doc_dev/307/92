EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I have followed the events in Berlin. When the "crossing" was 
announced, tears formed in my eyes. I was dramatically reminded of our 
country's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
A generation of Germans was permitted to experience what we, as Americans, can 
take for granted. We visited East and West Berlin a few years ago. To see the 
city, the wall, and the Brandenburg Gate from both sides was sobering. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is now breached! Surely it must give genuine happiness for Americans 
to know that native Berliners are now granted the privilege of visiting a part 
of their own city.
