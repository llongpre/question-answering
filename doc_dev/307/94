   The flying swami who soared over the Berlin
Wall with a motorized kite in 1983 returned Friday with a batch of
balloons to commemorate his dardevil peace mission and reclaim his
machine from East Germany.
   On the whole, things worked better for Swami Vishnu Devananda
when the wall was intact.
   First, East German border guards at Checkpoint Charlie thought a
silver-haired swami with orange and red balloons emblazoned with
thanks to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was taking glasnost
a bit far.
   ``You're in East Germany now,'' a guard said as the swami, in
the pink-and-orange peace robes of his Canadian-based sect, went
through, followed by a half-dozen supporters. ``Take that stuff
back to West Germany.''
   ``O.K., O.K.'' the 62-year-old swami replied. He shoved a
homemade ``peace passport'' nd retraced his steps.
   Back in the West, he floated the balloons toward the wall, but
those that didn't burst on the branches of a tree floated right
back.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, the wind was wrong again. More
balloons, this time trailing pictures of his kite, floated
stubbornly westward.
   Ever resourceful, the swami tried his luck with a dozen doves.
Most of them flew west.
   Moving right along in the quest for something workable, the
swami's party arrived at the tiny airstrip on the edge of West
Berlin from which he took off in 1983.
   Then the real trouble started. A model plane supposed to fly
around trailing a small peace banner wouldn't start, then did but
crashed twice. When it finally was airborne, the banner was twisted
and unreadable.
   It was too late by then for the the highlight of the plan,
crossing into East Berlin to present a letter of thanks to
Communist leader Egon Krenz for answering the swami's prayers to
open the wall.
   Was that the end of the swami's tale of woe? Nope. His followers
discovered during the week that his kite had been destroyed.
   ``What can you do?'' he said, and shrugged. ``We'll go tomorrow.
I'd like to thank them anyway for being so nice when I was
arrested. They gave me a cheese sandwich and a subway ticket.''
   In 1983, the Indian-born swami landed his kite in a field
outside East Berlin, was sent back to the West after six hours of
interrogation. He leads the Svinanda Yoga Vendata sect based in
Quebec, which claims 100,000 members.
