<HEAD>Reagan's Dream of Walk Through Wall Takes Place Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan had a light
schedule in Berlin today, a day before he is to fulfill a dream of
walking through the now-crumbling Berlin Wall.
   Reagan, 79, and his wife Nancy arrived just after midnight
Monday to start a 10-day trip through Germany, Poland, the Soviet
Union and Italy.
   The Berliner Morgenpost daily greeted the Reagans with a story
recounting his speech June 12, 1987, before the wall, where he
challenged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``open this
gate ... tear down this wall.''
   The wall now has been open since last November, when the
Communists then ruling East Germany, in a desperate attempt to
retain power, granted freedom of travel to its citizens. The
Communists have lost all power, and the two Germanys are to unite
into one country on Oct. 3.
   Reagan has a busy schedule Wednesday, when he is to walk through
the landmark Brandenburg Gate in the former area of the wall and
meet with democratically elected officials in East Berlin.
   He also is to give a speech Wednesday on the future of united
Germany.
   On Thursday he travels to Bonn, the West German capital, to meet
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and on Friday he is to be given a
ceremonial sendoff by U.S. military units at Tempelhof Airport in
central Berlin as he departs for Warsaw.
   Reagan was resting today after the long flight from California,
and had a dinner scheduled with Berlin community leaders in the
evening.
