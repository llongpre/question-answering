<P>
The West German government announced Wednesday that one of the biggest ever 
exchanges of spies with East Germany could occur before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn said it will soon swap four Communist-run agents in return for the release 
of 24 accused Western operatives held by East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after West German President Richard von Weizsaecker 
reported that he had pardoned two government secretaries who had passed state 
secrets to their Communist agent-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
After West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's talks with East German Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow in Dresden, West Germany's minister for inner-German 
affairs, Dorothee Wilms, declared of the negotiated spy exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this means the chapter of prisoners and agents is now ended. That is 
the prerequisite for the two governments to cooperate in trust." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kohl and Modrow agreed that Berlin's most famous symbol, the 
Brandenburg Gate, should be opened to pedestrian traffic Friday. Both leaders 
are expected to attend the ceremony, which would be a final, significant 
breaching of the Berlin Wall, in the eyes of most Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In Dresden, concluding his two-day, first visit to East Germany, Kohl met with 
opposition and church leaders and urged them to help shape future relations 
between the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that Bonn would like, as soon as possible, to assist 
in dealing with such joint East-West German problems as rebuilding the 
railroads, enhancing the environment and installing modern communications 
between the states. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's proposals came on the same day that the Communist Party daily newspaper 
Neues Deutschland reported that East German industrial output decreased by 2.5% 
last month. The account attributed the fall to the exodus of East German 
workers, which led to the crisis that eventually saw the Communist Party regime 
overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's official report confirmed accounts circulating in diplomatic 
circles that the East German regime had been misreporting economic figures to 
show the economy in much better shape than is actually the case. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported serious consumer good shortages and reduced ability to 
fulfill export commitments. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin on Wednesday, the West German opposition Social Democratic Party 
ended its three-day annual conference by pledging to work for unity with East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We will strive for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people find 
unity in free self-determination," the party said in its concluding statement. 
</P>
<P>
In a "Berlin Declaration" approved Monday, the party indicated that it is 
planning to draw up ways of cooperating with East Germany that could lead to 
some kind of confederation. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders expressed concern that Kohl's Christian Democrats may capitalize 
on the opening of the Berlin Wall and the German reunification issue to win 
another term in next December's national election. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, sources said Von Weizsaecker's pardoning of the two secretaries, Elke 
Falk and Margret Hoeke, both West German citizens, was part of a deal that had 
been worked out between Walter Priesnitz, a senior Bonn official, and East 
German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeke had been a secretary in Von Weizsaecker's own office. She was sentenced 
to eight years in prison in August, 1987, when she admitted handing over state 
papers to her boyfriend, who worked for the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Falk worked in several Bonn ministries, including the chancellor's office, and 
was jailed for 6 1/2 years last May. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had passed secret documents to her control agent, whom she met 
through a newspaper lonely-hearts column in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The two women presumably will be allowed to remain in West Germany if they 
choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel has long been identified with spy exchanges, beginning with the swap of 
American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel.
