EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>

Gus the cab driver was practicing some street-smart capitalism. He scoffed at 
the Southern Californians' offer of $10 to drive five of them around East 
Berlin for two hours last weekend. The burly man with a round, gentle face 
noted that his counterparts on the other side of the wall demand 30 West German 
marks an hour per person. Seeming to argue that the winds of democracy already 
had brought East and West together, he said, "We are worth the same now." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. More than holes in the Berlin Wall will be required to do that. Gus 
and fellow driver Henry finally settled on their two cabs for two hours at 
roughly $10 a person. That is less than a bus tour. At the same time, Gus and 
Henry would pocket $25 each in hard currency in two hours' time. Not a bad 
day's work, considering that amount will buy nearly a month's apartment rent or 
gasoline in the heavily subsidized East Berlin economy. 
</P>
<P>
These are good times for Gus and his fellows. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Berlin, East Germany and other East Bloc countries has become the 
thing Europeans want to do this winter -- the destinations of choice as a whole 
region emerges from four decades of repression and economic stagnation. Airline 
flights are jammed. Trains are booked far in advance. Hotel rooms are hard to 
get. Pan Am reports that traffic to Eastern Europe has increased by 25% over 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin is the strongest magnet of all. 
</P>

"Everybody wants to go to Berlin," Danish travel agent Marianne Lohse told 
members of the California group attending a week-long series of environmental 
conferences in Copenhagen. Now the contingent was exploring a chance to extend 
their travel by one day to squeeze in a quick trip to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The going grew more complicated when an official of the Polish embassy in 
Copenhagen urged the party to visit Warsaw, too. He offered to provide visas 
quickly. The incredibly patient Lohse of the Danish travel agency explored at 
least a dozen combinations of routes and times into Berlin and/or Warsaw. One 
leg of each potential route was already booked to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Dec. 7, we learned that Lohse had achieved what had seemed 
to be the impossible only a day before: a flight out of Copenhagen Saturday 
morning to Warsaw, Warsaw to West Berlin via Frankfurt Saturday evening, and 
returning Sunday night to Copenhagen by way of Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
For all the change, visiting Eastern Europe for the first time can be daunting. 
Arriving at Warsaw's airport was like stepping into a 1950s black-and-white 
movie. Armed soldiers stood at the foot of the airline ramp. Passport guards 
stared grimly from passport photo to visitor time and again before stamping 
approval. Passengers, including many Polish-Americans coming for the holidays, 
jammed customs lines with bulging suitcases and cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Those were minor anxieties and inconveniences, though. Graced with a five-inch 
blanket of fresh snow, Warsaw was much less bleak than expected. After lunch 
for five at the Victoria Hotel for 92,000 zlotys (about $23), driver Leszek 
Drzazgowski took us through historic sections of the city, including stops at 
the site of the ghetto, the church where Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski's crypt was 
covered with fresh flowers and the Old Town market square. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the wall breached, getting into East Berlin at the Friedrichstrasse 
S-bahn station still has a Cold War atmosphere. When our group tried to return 
to West Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie, we were told we must exit along the same 
route we had entered, a bone-chilling 20-minute walk back to the station. 
There, the guards seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to clear us. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin is home for most of the great buildings that survived World War II. 
It has taken more than 40 years, but the majority of gutted structures have 
been restored handsomely. The tour included Hitler's unmarked bunker and the 
Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden to Alexanderplatz and Marx-Engels Platz, the 
cathedral, the state opera house, Old Town and the museums alongside the River 
Spree. 
</P>
<P>
There was a stop for beer and coffee at a comfortable tavern in Old Town, where 
students at the adjacent table laughed and joked as Henry and Gus debated in 
German how to answer our questions about the changes in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Both in Warsaw and East Berlin, guides remarked that they are no longer 
harassed by police over petty infractions or perceived violations. "I don't 
have to do that any more," Henry said, referring to his unbuckled seat belt. In 
Warsaw, Drzazgowski commented, "You don't have to worry about tickets. The 
police don't have anything to do. And they don't want to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the west side of the Bradenburg Gate, thousands of tourists bundled 
against the cold wind walked half a mile to the Berlin Wall on Sunday 
afternoon. There was no hammering here, and not much celebration. Many walked 
up and touched the graffiti-covered barrier silently, in awe, much like people 
seeing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington for the first time. They 
were not mourning the fact that it was coming down, of course, but perhaps 
reflecting on what it had meant for so many years, and what the future might 
hold.
