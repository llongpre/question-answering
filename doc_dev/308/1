   Officials at two airports assessed millions of
dollars in damage Wednesday after a storm packing winds of 99 miles
per hour scattered private aircraft like toys.
   Sixty-four planes were damaged _ 42 at McCarran International
Airport here and 22 at Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson _
when hurricane-force wind ripped through the Las Vegas Valley on
Tuesday evening. Ten aircraft were heavily damaged or destroyed at
McCarran; 13 were destroyed at Sky Harbor.
   No injuries were reported.
   No commercial aircraft were damaged although some commercial
flights were barred from taking off or landing until the storm
passed, McCarran spokeswoman Vicki Donaldson said.
   Damage was ``well into the millions'' and could reach as high as
$14 million, Ms. Donaldson said. Damage also was estimated in the
millions at Sky Harbor.
   Two aircraft used by Scenic Airlines Inc. for Grand Canyon tours
were blown into each other. The roof of the Scenic terminal, on the
northern edge of the sprawling McCarran field, suffered heavy
damage.
   A hangar belonging to Circus Circus Enterprises was nearly
demolished, with one private jet left resting atop another.
   One airplane was blown some 200 feet at McCarran, airport
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. A number of aircraft were flipped, and
two corporate hangars were destroyed, he added.
   A large door on a hangar housing a $1 million Lockheed jet
belonging to entertainer Wayne Newton was blown away but the jet
was undamaged.
   ``We have no idea where the door went,'' one of Newton's pilots,
Mike Cotton, said Wednesday.
   Damage at the airports was the only significant loss reported.
There was some minor flooding and downed power lines, police
spokesman Matt Alberto said. About 35,000 homes and businesses were
without power for a period.
   Some residents were rattled by the fierce wind and rain.
   ``It was out of control. We could not see out of the windows of
our agency,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at Golden Valley
Travel. ``The winds were blowing so hard. All of our phones and
electricity was out for about three hours.''
   National Weather Service instruments recorded winds up to 90
miles per hour before lightning knocked out service at about 6 p.m.
That is the highest windspeed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley,
said Charlie Schlott of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   ``I've been here a few years and that's the highest windspeed
I've ever seen,'' Feick said. ``It was pretty nasty, the tower was
swaying quite a bit.''
