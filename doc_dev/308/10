   Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver's call for repealing the insurance industry's longstanding exemption from federal antitrust laws signals tougher Reagan administration oversight of insurance companies. 

   The Justice Department also has decided to endorse -- or at least not try to block -- such legislation, according to administration officials and a draft version of testimony to be presented to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee tomorrow. 

   The moves will provide a boost for legislation repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts the industry from most federal antitrust regulation. 

   Such legislation already enjoys widespread support on Capitol Hill because it offers lawmakers a way to show they are trying to solve the problems of high insurance premiums and difficulty in obtaining certain kinds of liability coverage. 

   In the past, Reagan administration officials have toyed with the idea of supporting such legislation as part of a strategy to make comprehensive overhaul of liability laws more appealing to consumer groups and lawmakers. 
But now, the administration for the first time appears willing to end its support for McCarran-Ferguson and work with proponents seeking to repeal it. 

   "I ask you to join me in seeking repeal" of the exemption, Mr. Oliver told a consumer-group conference Friday. 
"Let's remove the industry's special protection," he said, and "remove the blinders Congress placed on the FTC so we can look" at potential antitrust problems. 

   Although Mr. Oliver's comments weren't specifically cleared by the White House, commission officials said the remarks indicated the administration is taking a more flexible position. 

   A number of House and Senate Democratic leaders support repeal of McCarran-Ferguson, and consumer groups also are pushing the legislation. 

   Industry spokesmen and Justice Department officials have argued that affordability and availability problems won't be eased by ending or scaling back antitrust exemptions. 
But Congress isn't likely to go along with a more sweeping White House-backed proposal limiting damage awards. 

   For example, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said he intends to hold hearings this year to try to draft a "more balanced bill" that will provide better protection to consumers than the administration's proposal. 
"We should look at the issue more carefully," Sen. Biden said in a recent interview. 
"But I'm doubtful of resolving it. 
It's such a contentious, deeply divisive issue."
