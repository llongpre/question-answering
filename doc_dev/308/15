   A company that started building a $60 million,
magnetically levitated passenger rail system in Las Vegas has
abandoned the project, leaving behind concrete track pillars and an
unfinished station.
   Magnetic Transit of America Inc. cited financial difficulties
and ``reasons beyond our control'' for pulling out of the elevated
rail project Thursday.
   ``It has become increasingly evident that termination is the
only responsible business decision to be made,'' said MTA President
John Kapala.
   MTA had built a dozen track pillars and a station at the
Children's Museum in the new downtown library as part of its plan
to run a 1.1-mile magnetically levitated system through the
downtown area.
   The company was rebuffed in its efforts to link the proposed
system with the Las Vegas Strip, the glitzy heart of the casino
district. Kapala said that was ``a very important element'' in the
decision to scrap the project.
   City Councilman Arnie Adamsen said the West German company
pulled out purely for business reasons.
   Adamsen said the company intended the system to be a
demonstration of the new technology and hoped to eventually link it
to the Strip, McCarran International Airport and other parts of the
Las Vegas Valley.
   ``It wasn't going to be a revenue producer,'' Adamsen said. ``It
was presented to me as the first leg of a transportation system in
the valley.''
   Adamsen said city officials, who obtained a $1.6 million grant
from the federal government to build the Children's Museum station,
made it clear to MTA officials in meetings this week that it is the
company's responsibility for paying an estimated $4 million to
remove what has already been built.
   The company had constructed 12 concrete columns and some 7,000
square feet of platform at the museum station. It said it invested
$10 million in the project.
   Construction on the system began in 1988 but was halted in June
as the company began reassessing the project.
   Skeptics had said from the project's inception that it would
carry few riders between the Cashman Field convention center and
ballpark complex and downtown and would have to be part of a bigger
system linked with the airport and Strip to succeed.
