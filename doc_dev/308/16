<LEADPARA>  Insurers, who have long contended their industry is exempt from antitrust law,
can be sued for certain price-fixing activities, a federal appeals court ruled
Tuesday.;    Ruling in a case brought by California and 18 other states
against 32 U.S. and foreign insurance companies, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco found that a lower court had erred in dismissing the case. The
lower court had ruled largely on the grounds that the insurers were exempt
from antitrust suits under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which Congress passed in
1945. The act provided what had been considered sweeping exemptions to the
insurance industry from antitrust law.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  INSURERS CAN FACE PRICE-FIXING SUITS
COURT RULING IS BLOW TO ANTITRUST PROTECTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Lawyers for the states and other legal experts said the ruling marked a
significant change in the way the courts have interpreted the McCarran Act's
key provisions.;    The appeals court said insurers lose their antitrust
exemption when they work in concert with foreign insurers or with other
companies not covered by the act to fix prices or control the market.;    And
it said that in this case the insurers had lost their antitrust exemption by
organizing a boycott by reinsurers of insurance companies that were balking at
changes the defendants were seeking in the way liability insurance is sold.
Boycotts are specifically excluded from the actions allowed under the McCarran
Act.  </TEXT>
