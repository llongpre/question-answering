A tape recording of conversations between controllers and a pilot has shed no 
new light on the Feb. 19 crash of a private plane that killed 10 Las Vegans 
bound for John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration officials played the tape Friday at a news 
conference at McCarran International Airport. The tape indicated no problems 
and ended with pilot Hassan Berro confirming that he was 4 miles east of 
Corona, Calif., and headed for John Wayne under visual flight rules. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed moments later in heavy clouds, near the top of a 2,270-foot 
ridge in the Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Metro Police Officer Michael Cranson, his wife, their five children 
and Cranson's sister-in-law and brother-in-law were killed along with the 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was taking his family on a trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles when 
the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The tape between Berro and controllers at Norton and Riverside indicated no 
problems and ended with the controller telling the pilot that radar service was 
terminated and the plane was to continue under VFR into the Orange County 
airport.
