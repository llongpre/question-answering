   A thunderstorm gusting to 99 mph destroyed or
damaged at least 55 planes at two airports and wrecked two hangars,
causing more than $14 million in losses, authorities said today.
   The storm Tuesday evening also knocked out power to 40,000 homes
and businesses.
   About 10 planes were heavily damaged, several were overturned
and one was blown about 200 feet at McCarran International Airport,
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. Two corporate hangars were demolished,
he said.
   Damage was estimated at $14 million by Vicki Donaldson, an
airport spokeswoman, although Ingalls cautioned that was an initial
assessment.
   At Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson, 13 private planes
were destroyed and others damaged, spokeswoman Teddy Macknic said.
Losses will run in the millions of dollars, she said.
   No injuries were reported from the storm, which hit about 5:30
p.m.
   ``It was out of control,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at a
travel agency when the storm hit. ``The winds were blowing so hard.
All of our phones and electricity was out for about three hours.''
   The National Weather Service clocked winds up to 90 mph before
lightning knocked out electricity about 6 p.m. That was the highest
wind speed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley, said Charlie Schlott
of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   By 10 p.m. power was restored to all but about 15,000 customers
near the airport and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the
Las Vegas Valley power company.
