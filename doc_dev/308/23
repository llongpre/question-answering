A Southern California pilot escaped serious injury when his small plane crashed 
about a mile short of the runway at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The plane skidded across vacant lots and halted about 20 feet from a concrete 
wall. Authorities said the pilot, Donald Morrill, 57, of Highland, near San 
Bernardino, radioed the tower that he was running low on fuel. He was 
hospitalized in stable condition with face and ankle injuries. The plane was 
flying from Utah to California.
