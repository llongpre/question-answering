   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee approved a bill that
would cut the heart out of the insurance industry's antitrust
exemption.
   The bill was approved, 10-5, by a panel of the House
Judiciary committee, split along party lines, with Democrats
supporting the legislation. Chairman Jack Brooks, (D.,
Texas), said that he expects the committee to complete work
on the bill next week and send it to the full House.

   Under the 46-year-old McCarran-Ferguson Act, insurers have
been exempt from antitrust law in order to allow companies to
share actuarial information. But the subcommittee bill would
specifically ban price-fixing, monopolies, tying the purchase
of one insurance product with another, and carving up
competitive territories. The industry would still be allowed
to continue to share data, but it would be barred from
sharing data analysis.
   The Judiciary Committee approved a version of the bill
late last year, but the full House didn't vote on it before
adjourning for the session. "The difference here is that we
are seven months earlier in the process than we were last
year," said Linda Lipsen, a lobbyist for Consumers Union and
an advocate of the bill. "If we can forge ahead, we are
likely to see this on the president's desk."
   Some insurance trade groups, which have vehemently fought
the bill for years, took the unusual step of negotiating with
the committee staff to try to draft a version that the
insurance industry could accept. "The staff reports to me
that considerable progress has been made in these talks, and
I think it would be to everyone's advantage to complete this
effort," said Mr. Brooks.
   Insurance lobbyists said they plan to continue pressing
for changes in the bill. Although the Judiciary Committee may
vote as early as Tuesday, the full House is unlikely to vote
on the matter before February, insurance lobbyists predicted.
   At least two similar bills have been introduced in the
Senate, including one that repeals the entire
McCarran-Ferguson Act, sponsored by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah,
the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee.
