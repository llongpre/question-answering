<LEADPARA>  Insurers, which have long contended their industry is exempt from antitrust
law, can be sued for certain price-fixing activities, a federal appeals court
ruled Tuesday. Ruling in a case brought by California and 18 other states
against 32 U.S. and foreign insurance companies, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco found that a lower court had erred in dismissing the case. The
lower court had ruled largely on the grounds that the insurers were exempt
from antitrust suits under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which Congress passed in
1945. The act provided what had been considered sweeping exemptions to the
insurance industry from antitrust law. Lawyers for the states and other legal
experts said the ruling marked a significant change in the way the courts have
interpreted the McCarran Act's key provisions.  </LEADPARA>
