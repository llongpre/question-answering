   Cars were sent careening off highways,
windows shattered and a jetliner was jolted in the air by the chain
of atomic bomb-like blasts that tore through a rocket fuel plant
here.
   ``I was sitting in a booth eating pizza and the windows blew
out,'' Officer Michael Peterson of the Nevada Highway Patrol said
Wednesday, after the explosions erupted from the industrial park 10
miles from Las Vegas.
   ``We thought the whole building was going down,'' he said.
``Everybody took off right away.''
   Cars traveling on Highway 148 were knocked off the road by the
concussion, and motorists were injured, said Capt. Terry Edwards of
the Clark County Fire Department.
   ``People in their vehicles on this road were injured and their
cars were damaged,'' he said. ``They just went off the road and
wrecked.''
   Authorities said more than 250 people were injured and one
person was killed by the explosions, which struck just before noon
Wednesday at the plant that manufactures ingredients for space
shuttle rocket fuel.
   The blasts, which made gamblers briefly flee at least one
casino, were recorded by seismographs at California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, 200 miles away.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground, and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, a
Henderson resident who was in her pickup truck at the time of the
blasts.
   Gaming tables were briefly abandoned at Sam's Town on Boulder
Highway, but 15 minutes later it appeared there was no danger and
hundreds of gamblers went back inside, said resort spokeswoman
Shelley Roberts.
   A Las Vegas-bound America West jetliner approaching McCarran
International Airport was rocked by the blasts, said passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   There were no injuries aboard Flight 46, which originated in
Burbank, Calif.
   ``First we saw these very intense, hot flames. It didn't mean
much to us at first. We thought they were burning tires or
something. Then, there was another slight jolt,'' he said.
   Several large windows and sliding glass doors at the airport _
less than 10 miles from the blast site _ were shattered by the
explosion, and some ceiling tiles were knocked loose, said airport
spokesman Roy Clawson.
   Pacific worker Joe Hedrick, 30, said he heard a series of four
explosions over several minutes, with the fourth blast sounding the
most powerful.
   Hendrick, tearful and distraught, with cuts on his arms, said he
an two co-workers were assembling a pollution control device when
they heard a pop and the room filled with smoke.
   ``The smoke was so thick it could choke you. It smelled like
plastic,'' Hedrick said. The pop was followed by a blast that blew
metal and fiberglass wall panels off the building.
   Hedrick said he fled in his truck and was about 2 miles from the
plant when another explosion shattered the windshield.
   ``You've seen pictures of a nuclear detonation with a cloud that
runs across the ground. It looked like that,'' Hedrick said of the
final blast. ``The further we drove it seemed the blasts kept
coming.''
   The plant is in an isolated desert area on the western fringes
of Henderson, southeast of Las Vegas. The industrial complex dates
back to World War II when titanium was processed there.
