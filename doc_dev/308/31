   A federal judge ruled today that portions of a
1952 law allowing deportation of aliens for advocating world
communism are unconstitutional because they violate immigrants'
First Amendment rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out a
congressional exception to a subsequent law, which gave free speech
rights to all immigrants except members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Congress, he said, already has passed sufficient laws dealing
with terrorism and his decision didn't diminish the government's
power to deport aliens for reasons unrelated to their speech.
   ``We do not minimize the government's concerns with foreign
policy or national security interests,'' Wilson said, reading his
decision in a crowded courtroom. ``Nor do we in this day and age
deny the real and lethal threat that terrorism poses for our
nation.''
   ``Our decision today, however, will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combatting terrorism,'' he said.
   By invoking the McCarran-Walter provisions, he said, ``the
government is trying to stifle certain ideas from entering our
society from certain aliens.''
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper,'' he
added.
   Wilson addressed both the 36-year-old McCarran-Walter Act and a
1987 statute, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The latter
act gave aliens the same First Amendment rights as citizens when it
came to deportation proceedings, but made several exceptions such as
the denial of First Amendment rights to members of the PLO.
   The four provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act which he ruled
unconstitutional provide that aliens may be deported if they
advocate or are affiliated with a group that advocates the doctrines
of world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful
destruction of property.
   The PLO exception that was struck down provided for deportation
of PLO members who advocated the same ideologies.
   The judge ruled in the case of eight immigrants who appealed
deportation proceedings begun under the McCarran-Walter Act after
they were arrested by federal agents and held without bail.
