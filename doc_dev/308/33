<HEAD>Judge Allows Suit Against Government Filed By Palestinians, Kenyan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Seven Palestinians and a Kenyan can sue the
U.S. government for allegedly targeting them for prosecution
because of their political beliefs, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, in allowing trial to
proceed, criticized the government Wednesday for filing new charges
against two of the Palestinians under a law allowing the exclusion
and deportation of aliens deemed undesirable.
   The Justice Department has been trying for 2{ years to deport
the eight, accusing them of having ties to a terrorist group, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   But none of the eight has been charged with criminal acts and
all have denied membership in the organization.
   The government first attempted to deport them under a section of
the McCarran-Walter Act that allowed deportation of people for
affiliations with groups advocating world communism,
totalitarianism or property destruction.
   In December, Wilson declared those provisions of the act
unconstitutional.
   The government then accused six of the defendants of visa
violations and two of violations under the section of the
McCarran-Walter Act dealing with undesirable aliens.
   The eight, along with several immigrant rights groups, responded
by suing the government.
   The judge said he was disturbed by the government's tactics.
   ``I don't see how this new section of McCarran-Walter is all
that different than the one we ruled on,'' Wilson told government
lawyers. ``Are we going to have to deal with each section of the
McCarran-Walter Act piece by piece?''
