<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland Athletics right fielder Jose Canseco was briefly detained by police at 
McCarran International Airport after reportedly causing a disturbance on a 
flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Police took Canseco aside after he got off the flight late Tuesday night and 
questioned him for about 20 minutes before letting him go, said Metropolitan 
Police Lt. Ron Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the pilot had radioed ahead and alerted police that Canseco was 
being unruly with a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he didn't do some of the things she told him to do, like putting on 
his seat belt," he said. "The flight attendant told the officers she had 
interpreted some of the things he had said back to her as threats. His side was 
that the flight crew was lying about the accusations." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher called the incident no big deal and said police stationed at the airport 
commonly respond to similar incidents.
