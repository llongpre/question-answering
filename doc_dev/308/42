   A bill repealing many of the industry's
exemptions from antitrust laws was approved Wednesday by the House
Judiciary Committee over unanimous Republican opposition.
   On a 19-17 vote, the panel voted to open insurance companies to
antitrust lawsuits for price-fixing, attempted monopolizing,
allocating territories among rival companies or forcing consumers
to buy insurance they do not want in order to qualify for coverage
that they do.
   Three of the committee's 22 Democrats, Reps. Dan Glickman of
Kansas, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio,
voted with all of the 14 Republicans in opposing the bill.
   Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from
antitrust suits since 1945 under the McCarran-Feguson Act, which
delegated regulation of the now $500 billion-a-year industry to
state governments.
   Consumer groups and others have complained since the mid-1970s
that lax oversight by some states has permitted the companies to
use anticompetitive practices to both deny coverage and raise rates
dramatically.
   ``Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage
severely restricted,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
judiciary committee's chairman. ``Congress can no longer ignore the
widespread economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high
premiums or policies that are unavailable at any price.''
   The federal antitrust prohibitions would not apply in states
with ``active'' regulatory programs, thus preserving the
McCarran-Ferguson's basic policy to defer regulation to states, he
said. He did not say which states would qualify.
   The bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw
data on claims. But after a five-year transition period, it would
greatly weaken companies' reliance upon the Insurance Services
Office, a New York-based industry organization that now ``advises''
what rates should be charged.
   A similar bill was approved by the panel's economic and
commerical law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an
intensive industry lobbying effort. Democrats said they hope to
bring the new version to the full House in late summer or early
fall.
   Although similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
industry lobbyists say they are counting on Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala., both members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, to prevent it from every reaching a floor vote
there.
   ``If this bill is enacted into law, it may prove disastrous for
consumers adn small insurance companies alike,'' said Lowell Beck,
president of the National Association of Independent Insurors.
``Every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust
counts. Legal costs, which by necessity would be passed on to
consumers, would soar.''
   Consumer groups acknowledged they face an uphill fight, but
voiced optimism that the committee's vote Wednesday opening the way
for a fight on the House floor will put a public spotlight on the
issue.
   ``This represents an important breakthrough,'' said Robert
Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a grassroots consumer
organization claiming 2 million members. ``It demonstrates that an
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industry's
stranglehold over legislators.''
   Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, predicted
the bill will become a major election-year issue once it reaches
the House floor.
   ``Behind food and shelter, insurance is the single largest
expenditure of the year for the average consumer,'' she said.
``Just like the gun lobby, the insurance lobby is no longer being
perceived by Congress as invincible.''
   Lipsen disputed industry claims that premiums would rise, citing
a report by the General Accounting Office showing that rates fell
by 30 percent in Michigan after its legislature in 1982 repealed a
state antitrust exemption for workers compensation insurance.
   In addition to consumer groups, the bill has strong support from
the American Bankers Association and other bank trade groups whose
members are eager to jump into the insurance business through
subsidiaries.
