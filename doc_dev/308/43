</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun, who built a communications empire and 
helped transform Las Vegas from a small desert town into an entertainment 
mecca, died Saturday of cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun died at his home in Regency Towers at the exclusive Las Vegas Country 
Club after a yearlong battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
He was a man of contrast, reckless and reasoning, combative and compassionate, 
a news writer and a news maker. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-educated lawyer was a decorated World War II combat officer, a 
one-time publicist for mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel's Flamingo Hotel, a 
pioneer real estate investor and developer, and a crusading newspaper 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun founded Las Vegas' first television station, first competing daily 
newspaper and first cable television company. 
</P>
<P>
A man of action and influence who once was a Republican candidate for governor 
of Nevada, Greenspun mingled with world leaders and superstars. 
</P>
<P>
He played a behind-the-scenes role in Middle East affairs for Israel, where he 
became a national hero, cited by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for 
extraordinary service during the 1948 War of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun executed a daring gun-smuggling operation that delivered surplus U.S. 
arms to Israel during its struggle. He was convicted of Neutrality Act 
violations in 1950 and fined $10,000, but President John F. Kennedy pardoned 
him, and in his 1966 autobiography, "Where I Stand," Greenspun said it was "the 
proudest thing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
He hobnobbed with celebrities and attended the wedding of Frank Sinatra and Mia 
Farrow when the rest of the news media was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend of Howard Hughes 
</P>
<P>
His friendship with Howard Hughes led to the billionaire's move to Las Vegas in 
1966 on Greenspun's invitation. Hughes bailed the city out of a recession, 
whitewashed its mobster reputation and bought more than $100 million in hotels 
and land. 
</P>
<P>
Articulate, dynamic and fearless, Greenspun was a favorite interview subject 
for the national media in search of Las Vegas exposes and often appeared on 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
His widely read front-page column, "Where I Stand," which he pounded out on a 
battered Underwood typewriter, was feared and loved, ruthless and 
heart-rending. 
</P>
<P>
He both attacked and defended politicians, suspected mobsters, the federal 
government, organized labor, judges, lawmakers and citizens as he played a 
major role in shaping the skyline, reputation and policy of Las Vegas as it 
grew from a small desert town into the state's largest city and a worldwide 
tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Compassion 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun never backed away from a good fight, whether the foe was a powerful 
politician, law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service or a business mogul. 
He was compassionate toward the disadvantaged and downtrodden, employing many 
handicapped people, supporting local charities and doling out toys from a 
closet in his office to children who stopped in off the street. 
</P>
<P>
His battle scars were numerous. He triumphed over an advertising boycott of his 
newspaper instigated by U.S. Sen. Pat McCarran, and when Sen. Joseph R. 
McCarthy publicly denounced him as an "ex-communist," Greenspun turned the 
tables and accused McCarthy of being a Nazi sympathizer with communist 
leanings. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1972 Watergate scandal, burglars broke into Greenspun's office at 
the Las Vegas Sun and tried to open his safe. The publisher believed the 
intruders were White House "plumbers" seeking documents he possessed relating 
to a $100,000 contribution from Hughes to President Richard M. Nixon to lift a 
Justice Department order blocking the tycoon from buying any more Las Vegas 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
E. Howard Hunt later testified that he and G. Gordon Liddy had, indeed, planned 
a burglary of Greenspun's safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Claiborne 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the Sun boldly defended Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne 
throughout the investigation and trials that led to Claiborne's historic ouster 
from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Born Herman Milton Greenspun in Brooklyn, N.Y., Aug. 27, 1909, Greenspun 
graduated from St. John's School of Law and aspired to be a trial lawyer but 
changed his mind after a client admitted stabbing a man to death, saying he 
could not defend such people. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun fought in France as a captain in General George S. Patton's 3rd Army. 
He was awarded the Croix de Guerre with silver star, Conspicuous Service Cross 
for the State of New York, four battle stars and a commendation from Gen. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Barbara; sons, Brian and Danny; daughters Janie 
Gale and Susan Fine; a brother, David; a sister, Alice Goldberg, and nine 
grandchildren, all of Las Vegas.
