<P>
Some of those Hank Greenspun afflicted during his life have a joke that they 
tell even now. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral in July, a crowd of more than 1,200 -- gamblers, politicians, 
friends and employees -- came to stand in the 100-degree desert sun. Some were 
there to say farewell, the joke goes, others to make sure he was really dead. 
</P>
<P>
But a month later, Greenspun had the last laugh. The one-time gun smuggler for 
Israel who ran a newspaper here, called Joe McCarthy a homosexual in print 
without any proof, sued the state's most powerful politician for conspiracy and 
won, and ran a sting operation on the sheriff, showed them he wasn't quite as 
dead as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before he died, it was announced on Aug. 8, Greenspun's family had signed 
a deal to keep his flagrant but failing newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun, alive for 
another 50 years. The Sun would merge business operations with the town's other 
paper, the profitable Las Vegas Review Journal, but maintain separate news and 
editorial staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun was gone, but his irascible or damnable, crusading or abusive, 
anything-but-timid newspaper was not. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement still must win federal exemption from antitrust laws. And many 
believe, if the two papers become partners, that the furious Sun will change 
its ways, in part because Hank's son, Brian, a gentler soul than his father, is 
running it. Brian had to sign over $20 million worth of family stock in the 
local cable franchise to make the deal and gets just 10% of the papers' 
combined profit in return. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Sun changes, the merger will preserve a competition that once 
was among the meanest, weirdest, most raucous and -- by modern standards -- 
most unethical newspaper wars ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a war, really, of two men, the two papers' owners, and their two 
different philosophies of life. 
</P>
<P>
One was Herman "Hank" Greenspun, the Brooklyn-born lawyer who came to Las Vegas 
in 1946 fresh from the Army hoping to start a race track and who became a 
celebrated crusader instead. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Donald W. Reynolds, an Oklahoma-bred son of a poor grocery peddler 
who parlayed $300 into a media company so private that few have heard of it. 
Yet Donrey (for Don Reynolds) Media Group owns more daily and weekly newspapers 
around the country than giant Gannett Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carried Gold Cards 
</P>
<P>
And as the owner of every dime's worth of stock, the reclusive 82-year-old 
Reynolds, who moves constantly among his seven homes, is one of America's 55 
billionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Between them there was real dislike, honestly felt. In print, Greenspun usually 
referred to Reynolds as "Uncle Piggy." Friends say that in private, Reynolds 
described Greenspun with expletives. In public, he cleaned it up and just 
called him "Vermin Greenscum." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was either man accused of running a great newspaper. For years, reporters 
here carried gold cards that entitled them to free meals and drinks at local 
hotels, and the papers let their advertising departments influence news 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1949 that Reynolds bought the Review Journal, then just his third 
newspaper, and promptly tried to break the unions. The paper that Greenspun 
would buy a year later and call the Sun was actually a strike paper started by 
Review Journal printers. 
</P>
<P>
The town was small and wide open, a collection of low-slung stucco buildings, a 
few casinos and, among the new residents, a mobster named Bugsy Siegel with a 
vision about a city built on the fantasy of greed. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds ran his newspaper for the same reason -- money. He is "strictly a 
bottom-line operator," said former Review Journal General Manager Bill Wright, 
the top executive at the paper from 1966 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In Reynolds' strategy, the editorial quality of the paper was not a primary 
concern, and the Review Journal was bland at best, though he always spent money 
on equipment to get the paper out fast and with a modern look. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinarily Profitable 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who would come to own most of the major media in Nevada and most of 
the billboards in Las Vegas, is so frugal, employees said, that he has located 
Donrey's executive offices in a compound with his home so that he can partly 
deduct his house as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
As Las Vegas grew, Wright said Reynolds used the paper as "the cow that has 
financed his empire," acquiring tiny papers in places like Arkadelphia, Ark., 
and Oskaloosa, Iowa. Today, the 135,000-circulation Review Journal is as big as 
almost all the other Donrey papers combined. 
</P>
<P>
And it is extraordinarily profitable. With revenue of more than $70 million and 
operating profit of more than $20 million a year, according to insiders, the 
Review Journal is more successful financially than all but a couple of Las 
Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Donrey President Fred Smith denies that the company has little concern for news 
quality. "We are bottom-line oriented," he said. "But we know to have a bottom 
line you have to have a good product." 
</P>
<P>
In Reynolds, Donrey also had a boss who employees say can be could be brutally 
abrupt and explosive. He fired his own son from the company, and his general 
managers call their annual meeting in Lake Tahoe "The Reaming in the Pines." 
</P>
<P>
If Reynolds owned his paper to make a profit, Greenspun owned his to make 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"For Hank, the idea of the Sun was kicking the hell out of everyone who 
deserved it," but "he didn't have the slightest concept of how a newspaper was 
produced on a daily basis," said Bryn Armstrong, executive editor of the Sun 
from 1963 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
When the race track plan that brought him to Vegas failed, he tried to start a 
magazine and then went to work as a publicist for Siegel's Flamingo hotel. 
After Siegel was murdered in Los Angeles, Greenspun ran into other unsavory 
business partners and finally decided to buy the local strike paper from the 
printers union for $1,000 down. 
</P>
<P>
Before he could start in earnest, he was convicted of smuggling guns to Israel. 
Greenspun had been recruited by the fledgling nation to run guns through Mexico 
three years earlier -- in violation of American neutrality in the Middle East. 
The sentence didn't include jail, however, and Greenspun returned to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived Up to Promise 
</P>
<P>
At the Review Journal, the publisher's column was called "From Where I Sit." 
With characteristic delicacy, Greenspun called his "Where I Stand," slapped it 
on Page 1 and promised on day one that he would never be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
His first target was Nevada's most powerful man, Democratic Sen. Patrick 
McCarran, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, boss of the state political 
machine, close ally of Joe McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"The old buzzard," Greenspun called him in print, leading a pack of "crawling 
sniveling jackals." He warmed up from there, combing the Kefauver hearings for 
links between McCarran and organized crime, writing column after column for 
nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, McCarran retaliated by ordering the casino owners to pull their 
advertising from the Sun. Twelve of the 13 casinos complied within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun sued the senator and the hotels for conspiracy. Town bookies gave him 
only 20-to-1 odds. But after Greenspun found a casino secretary who took the 
call from Washington with the boycott order, the casinos settled. And 
Greenspun's career was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, McCarran, giving a speech in Hawthorne, Nev., uttered the 
words "Greenspunism must be defeated," and dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, the Sun had gone on to be one of the first papers to publicly 
take on Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who at one point accused Greenspun of being an 
"ex-communist." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun wrote in a style he called "fighting the devil with his own fire." 
</P>
<P>
It is "common talk," one Greenspun column read, "that Sen. Joe McCarthy has 
often engaged in homosexual activities." Whether Greenspun had any proof was in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Darling of Liberals 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a Greenspun column even predicted that McCarthy would be killed. 
"Huey Long's death will be serene and peaceful compared with the demise of the 
sadistic bum from Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
Provoked, McCarthy persuaded the Postmaster General to try to revoke the Sun's 
second-class postage rights, alleging that Greenspun was inciting violence. The 
effort failed, and Greenspun had become a darling of liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, there were other crusades -- helping elect Michael 
O'Callaghan governor, fighting against atomic waste dumping and against the 
Internal Revenue Service -- all of them, in Greenspun's mind, in defense of the 
little guy. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best, though, was the case of Clark County Sheriff Glen Jones and 
"Roxie's" motel brothel, an establishment that had operated for years without 
interference from the law. 
</P>
<P>
When Greenspun accused Jones of being a secret partner in Roxie's, the sheriff 
sued for libel. And Greenspun countered with a bit of journalism not taught in 
any college. 
</P>
<P>
He hired a private investigator to pose as a Mafioso, wired him for sound and 
sent him off to offer to buy Roxie's from its legally entangled owner, Roxie 
Clippinger. 
</P>
<P>
When the fake mobster inquired about "protection" for his investment, Roxie 
assured him that the good sheriff was on the payroll, a claim verified in other 
tape-recorded meetings as well. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-part series in the Sun followed, and Jones dropped his libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
As often as not, Greenspun shot from the hip, writing first, gathering his 
evidence later. Sometimes he was right, and sometimes, even his own editors 
said, he was not. 
</P>
<P>
But he always believed his cause, said O'Callaghan, now a Sun executive, even 
if his many enemies say he never did a thing that wasn't for his own profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gaming Ignored 
</P>
<P>
At every opportunity, he railed against "Uncle Piggy," and the "knuckleheads" 
who ran "the little paper down the street," always in sarcastic prose. When the 
Reynolds' paper criticized his business dealings, he called it "a eunuch 
judging a man's lovemaking." 
</P>
<P>
With all this crusading, and with Reynolds' penny pinching, why did Reynolds 
ultimately win the war? 
</P>
<P>
First, neither paper was a model of journalistic prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Neither assigned reporters to cover the town's biggest industry -- gaming -- or 
the gaming commission full time until an upstart third paper, the Valley Times, 
began doing so in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did they cover the mob. It was the Chicago Sun-Times that exposed how Jimmy 
Hoffa used the Teamsters pension fund to bankroll the expansion of Las Vegas in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
And in a practice most newspapers would consider dishonest, for years the 
advertising sections ran the entertainment coverage of the papers -- and only 
those hotels that advertised got stories written about them. 
</P>
<P>
The Review Journal ad department even had a rubber stamp, which it used to mark 
"OK" those press releases that the news staff could put in the paper, usually 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Review Journal General Manager David Osborne says the hotels might have "taken 
advantage" and withheld advertising if the paper hadn't employed such policies. 
He says the policy has since been changed, though advertising experts in town 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sun, Brian Greenspun freely admits there is a category of story in his 
paper called "puff" -- which means stories written by the hotels themselves -- 
"if they aren't advertisers, they have to wait in line for the space for puff." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, for a time in the 1950s and early 1960s, during Greenspun's 
greatest crusades, the Sun was gaining on the Review Journal. By September, 
1963, only 7,500 in circulation separated them (the Review Journal led with 
35,441 copies). 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the morning of the Nov. 20, fire destroyed the Sun building and 
presses. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun managed to continue publishing, for months flying the paper in from 
California. But delivery was sporadic, often late, and the paper was thin. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Sun rebuilt, the Review Journal had gained a circulation lead 
of more than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Howard Hughes 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun's shortcomings as a manager were another problem. The Sun payroll was 
stocked with relatives, any one of whom -- including the telephone operator -- 
could order stories into the paper. Nor did Hank cover the city in any coherent 
way. He liked to focus on one crusade at a time, didn't like the idea of 
regular beats and disdained covering public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, many think even Greenspun's personality and reputation as a 
crusader waned. Some believe that it began to tarnish when, following a 
presidential pardon by John F. Kennedy on the smuggling charges, Greenspun ran 
for governor in 1962 and was soundly beaten in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Others think the decline started when he met Howard Hughes, who Greenspun 
helped to buy the Desert Inn upon Hughes' arrival in Las Vegas in 1966. Over 
the course of the next four years, Hughes and Greenspun would have complex 
business dealings, including a $4-million loan to Greenspun at 3% interest and 
the sale of Greenspun's TV station to Hughes for another $3.6 million, mostly 
so Hughes could program the all-night movies he would watch. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Hughes fled Las Vegas for Nassau in 1970, Greenspun had become 
wealthy, and thereafter, some say, his role as defender of the little guy 
seemed less credible. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics, such as University of Nevada at Reno journalism Prof. Jake 
Highton, contend that the Sun might have beaten the Review Journal had Hank not 
diverted his money into other enterprises. His son counters that it was these 
outside business that have kept the Sun alive, paying for more than $13 million 
in losses since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is doubtful that Greenspun's paper and personality were suited 
to the battle, even if he had had the money. And by the early 1980s, the Sun 
had entered a downward spiral. Its readers, Review Journal surveys showed, were 
mostly older Las Vegans who were dying out. The growing number of new residents 
read the Review Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the Sun's share of advertising lineage has dropped to less than 30% 
from 40% of the market. Daily circulation has dropped to 29% from 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Greenspuns ever consider selling the paper to preserve it? No, says 
Brian Greenspun. And the two most common rumors in town, that Gannett and Times 
Mirror Co. were interested in buying, are both false, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brian Greenspun claims that as early as 1979, his family approached Donrey 
about a merger. Discussions went nowhere, and in 1985, the Greenspuns tried 
again, this time ready to offer part of the family cable franchise. Again, 
Donrey said no. 
</P>
<P>
The last negotiations began in the summer of 1988, after doctors found that 
Hank had cancer, and by December many of the details were hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
Donrey would get 10% of the local cable company that the Greenspuns owned and 
an option to buy 35% more, if the Greenspuns could maintain majority share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasn't as Fun 
</P>
<P>
Even this must have tasted bitter. Years earlier, the Greenspuns had gone to 
court to keep Donrey out of the cable business on the basis that it already 
owned one of the local TV stations. Since then, Donrey lost its license for the 
station after the government found that it had cheated advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Why accept the offer now? Donrey President Smith adamantly denies that it was 
because Hank would no longer be on the scene. Rather, he said, the Greenspuns 
offered more. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Don Reynolds is nearly 83, enfeebled by arthritis and no longer running 
his company day to day. And Hank is gone, like others who carved Las Vegas from 
the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations own most of the casinos now, making their big money on slot 
machines, not high rollers. It isn't the scent of sin and gangsters that brings 
the tourists to town anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Greenspun used to curse the changes, his assistant, Ruthe Deskin, said. 
Running the newspaper wasn't as fun anymore. He didn't always like it that his 
town was growing up.
