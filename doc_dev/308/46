   The federal judge presiding over the antitrust suits filed by several states against some major insurance companies ordered both sides in the case to sharply limit pretrial evidence gathering, in an attempt to speed the proceedings. 

   Judge William Schwarzer rejected the defendants' plea for access to all the evidence compiled against them. 
Commenting to a packed courtroom that "the ticking of (lawyers') meters here is almost overwhelming," he limited so-called pretrial discovery in the case to the sole issue of whether the alleged insurer conspiracy is exempt from antitrust prosecution under federal law. 

   The judge ordered the 32 insurance-industry defendants to jointly file pointed, 25-page briefs on that question by Dec. 16. 
"The whole idea of this is to try to get to the heart of the matter with the least time and expense," Judge Schwarzer said. 

   The judge issued the orders at a pretrial status conference held here, the first time the combatants' more than 50 lawyers have met in court. 

   The cases involve 19 states that have filed antitrust suits against some leading insurance and reinsurance companies, their trade associations and some brokers, charging them with conspiring to reduce the availability of liability coverage during the mid-1980s. 

   Reinsurers sell policies allowing other insurance concerns to hedge their risks. 

   The pretrial rulings set out a clear agenda for the cases. 
First, the judge will decide whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act -- a 1944 statute that exempts insurers from federal antitrust laws, provided the companies are regulated by the states -- immunized from prosecution the alleged industry conspiracy to reduce insurance coverage during the mid-1980s. 

   The judge said he wants to avoid factual disputes during this primary stage, which will also focus on other legal issues, such as whether some Britain-based defendants fall within the U.S. court's jurisdiction. 

   Questions of fact, the judge said, may be tried at a later phase. 
The judge scheduled the next court hearing for July 7, 1989. 

   The judge's order for limited discovery dealt a blow to the defendants, who had requested access to all the evidence gathered by the states during their two-year investigation. 
Stephen Axinn, a New York-based lawyer representing General Reinsurance Corp., told the judge that the defendants don't want to be "blindsided" by evidence later in the trial. 

   Mr. Axinn continued that the defendants want a "level playing field" with the plaintiffs, but the judge interrupted and said, "they (the states) have built the field and you want to play on it." 

   The judge concluded: "What's the point of getting more information about a conspiracy, unless we establish that a conspiracy would violate the McCarran Act?" 

   On another matter Judge Schwarzer refused to issue a blanket protective order that would have kept all evidence in the case confidential. 
Instead, he asked the defendants to draw up a list of documents they believe include trade secrets.
