NEW U.S. CHARGES ARE FILED AGAINST TWO PALESTINIANS

Two-and-a-half years after they were arrested and jailed for alleged 
subversion, the Justice Department has filed new charges against two Los 
Angeles-area Palestinians, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney disclosed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"At the 11th hour, the government has filed new charges against our clients in 
a last-ditch attempt to bolster its faltering case," said Paul Hoffman, legal 
director of the ACLU's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Like the original case, the new charges in Immigration Court are being brought 
under the McCarthy-era McCarran-Walter Act, and are designed to deport the 
aliens, Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh, 33, of Long 
Beach. No criminal charges were ever filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the government charged Hamide and Shehadeh with "membership in, or 
affiliation with, an organization that advocates or teaches the duty or 
necessity or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of government 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
The organization referred to by the government is the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
The PFLP has a history of terrorist activities overseas and in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Steps In 
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson overturned the 
McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions under which Hamide and Shehadeh were 
charged, declaring them unconstitutional. The government has appealed to the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, their immigration cases were placed on hold by U.S. Immigration 
Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko until the federal appeal is decided. Hrycenko's 
decision to delay the deportation hearings also was appealed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, did not have before him the new charges, which were 
transmitted to the immigrants' lawyers last Friday night by federal attorney 
James A. Hunolt, a member of the Justice Department's Washington team 
prosecuting Hamide and Shehadeh. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman contends, however, that the new charges are no different than the old 
ones, and simply came from a paragraph in the McCarran-Walter Act preceding the 
sections that Wilson declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An End Run' 
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer for the aliens, Marc Van Der Hout of San Francisco, said this 
maneuver amounts to a ploy by the government to circumvent the decision by 
Wilson, who declared that aliens have the same free speech rights as American 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"This essentially is a desperate attempt on the government's part to do an end 
run around the clear ruling of the district court," Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh -- along with five other Palestinians and a Kenyan -- were 
arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for about two weeks on subversion 
allegations under the McCarran-Walter Act, a law that has been used to deport 
or exclude aliens deemed undesirable. At that time, they were accused of 
advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship and the unlawful 
destruction of property. 
</P>
<P>
All eight, who then faced deportation proceedings, denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Washington subsequently changed the subversion allegations against Hamide and 
Shehadeh, alleging that they advocated "the unlawful damage, injury or 
destruction of property" under another McCarran-Walter section. The new charges 
are in addition to this, immigration attorney Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the aliens facing visa violations have since received, in effect, 
waivers to remain in the United States. But three others still face visa 
violation action. Their cases are scheduled to continue today in Hrycenko's 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Today's immigration proceeding almost certainly will serve as a forum for the 
immigrants' lawyers to ask Justice Department attorneys why the new allegations 
were filed, Van Der Hout said.
