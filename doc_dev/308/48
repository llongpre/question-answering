   A federal judge's tentative decision to dismiss a massive lawsuit alleging that numerous big insurance companies conspired to control the insurance market signals only the first round of what still shapes up as a long, bitter legal fight. 

   The suit was brought in March 1988 by California and 18 other states and quickly became a symbol of the broad national backlash against skyrocketing insurance rates. 
Its primary targets include Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Allstate Insurance Co., Hartford Fire Insurance Co., Cigna Corp. and Lloyd's of London. 
The suit charges that the companies colluded to deny cities and businesses certain kinds of liability coverage and to drive up rates in order to offset increased underwriting losses. 

   In a 58-page opinion circulated among attorneys in the case last week, U.S. District Judge William W. Schwarzer concluded that, even if it were proved that the defendants conspired as alleged, they couldn't be held liable for it because of a 45-year old federal statute that exempts insurance companies from most antitrust laws. 
The judge also said Lloyd's couldn't be sued because of its foreign status. 

   Lawyers on both sides of the case cautioned that the proposed decision isn't final and predicted the case would go on. 
Judge Schwarzer set a hearing for Sept. 15 for comment on the proposed decision; lawyers for the California attorney general's office, which is handling the plaintiffs' side of the case, said they will press the judge to revise the decision. 
In any event, whatever ruling Judge Schwarzer renders is almost certain to be appealed, lawyers familiar with the case said. 
The suit has been seen as one of the most serious challenges ever to the special status granted the insurance industry by federal laws and other favorable government treatment. 
In 1944, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which allows insurance companies to engage in anticompetitive activities -- price-fixing, for example -- that would be considered illegal in most industries. 
The immunity, however excludes acts of "boycott, coercion or intimidation." 

   Critics have charged for years that the antitrust exemption permits a small cartel of dominant companies to manipulate the market, and the states' suit alleges precisely that. 
Specifically, the suit charges that beginning in September 1984, the defendants pressured an industry trade group into rewriting industrywide policy standards to exclude coverage for pollution damages and for "retroactive" losses -- losses occurring before the starting date of a policy. 

   The changes battered many municipalities, businesses and nonprofit organizations, which suddenly had to pay much higher premiums for less coverage. 
The industry has maintained that the changes were necessary because of court rulings in the early 1980s that greatly expanded their liability. 
But the lawsuit alleges that the changes amounted to an illegal industry boycott that limited the availability of liability insurance in the U.S. 

   However, in his tentative opinion, Judge Schwarzer said that the actions of the companies didn't constitute a boycott and thus were legal under the protections of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, regardless of whether collusion had occurred. 

   Even if the decision stands up through the appeals process, the insurance industry still faces attacks for such practices on other fronts. 
In November, California voters approved an initiative making insurers subject to the state's antitrust laws for any future collusive actions. 
The initiative also mandated sharp cutbacks in property and casualty insurance rates, although subsequent rulings by the state's insurance commission have made widespread rate rollbacks less likely. 
Consumer groups in other states are pushing for passage of similar measures.
