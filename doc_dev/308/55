   Light rain doused much of the East early today while a heat wave
continued to parch the West.
   Storms hit several Eastern states with hail and strong winds.
One-inch diameter hail fell at Newbury, N.H., and golf ball-size
hail pelted Geistown, Pa.
   Storm winds caused damage in parts of New Hampshire, southeast
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Winds gusted to between 80
and 100 mph at Sunapee, N.H., causing damage to homes and trees, and
gusts of 61 mph were recorded at Nashua, N.H.
   Downed trees blocked roads and cut power in parts of southwest
Pennsylvania, and a couple was in fair condition in a hospital after
being struck by lightning while fishing at a state park near
Johnstown.
   Rain and thunderstorms were continuing this morning from southern
New England across much of the Middle Atlantic States, northern
parts of Virginia and West Virginia, southern Ohio, the coast of the
Carolinas, southern parts of the central Gulf Coast, central Texas,
central Arizona and the Dakotas.
   Golf ball-size hail also fell at Grand Rapids and La Moure, N.D.
   Little relief was in sight today from the heat wave that has
gripped much of the Central and Western states. Highs were forecast
to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal from the upper Mississippi
Valley across the Rockies to much of Utah and Nevada.
   High temperature records were broken or tied Friday in at least
24 cities in 10 states from Missouri to California.
   In Utah, Cedar City and Moab set new all-time highs with readings
of 105 and 114 degrees, respectively. Moab's high broke by one
degree a mark that had stood since 1936.
   In Colorado, Alamosa and Grand Junction set record highs for the
fourth straight day with readings of 91 and 103, respectively.
   In California, Sacramento's high of 110 broke the previous record
of 107 set in 1905. Other record highs included 114 degrees in Las
Vegas, 108 in Casper, Wyo., 102 in Denver, and 101 in St. Joseph, Mo.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast, and scattered
thunderstorms across the upper Mississippi Valley and western
Michigan, as well as Arizona. Light rain was expected along the
coast of Washington state. Skies were predicted to be generally
sunny over the remainder of the nation.
   Highs generally were expected to be in the upper 80s or 90s,
except for 60s or 70s along much of the Pacific Coast, 70s from the
lower Great Lakes through New England, about 100 degrees in the
northern and central Plains, the central Rockies, much of Utah and
Nevada and the interior valleys of California, and near 110 degrees
in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45 degrees at Houlton,
Maine, to 100 at Las Vegas.
