   Federal law should treat insurance companies
the same as other businesses, says a senator who is leading his
third charge against a special antitrust exemption for the industry.
   ``The case for repealing the insurance industry's antitrust
exemption is overwhelming,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told a
news conference Thursday. ``Insurance is vital to the nation. No
one can be secure without it. Yet those who provide it do not have
to comply with our national policy of free competition.''
   Metzenbaum said the Federal Trade Commission has been handcuffed
by the exemption, which makes it almost impossible to crack down on
misleading advertising or deceptive marketing practices.
   Though attempts to ax the antitrust immunity failed in the
previous two sessions of Congress, Metzenbaum said the chances of
repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act have improved this year.
   ``The only question is, `What is the timing?''' he said. ``My
timing is now.''
   In February, the American Bar Association formally joined the
ranks of supporters and this week the insurance industry's biggest
rate-making organization bowed to pressure to stop distributing
advisory rates.
   Companies had tended to keep their rates fairly close to those
provided by the Insurance Services Office Inc., leading to
complaints that the advisory rates were akin to price-fixing. The
ISO's action is intended to squelch those complaints.
   Metzenbaum and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who also appeared at the
news conference, stressed they were willing to negotiate with the
insurance industry on the final shape of the legislation.
   ``I don't think any harm would come to the insurance industry if
it went into effect word-for-word as Sen. Metzenbaum is introducing
it but neither he nor I nor anyone else is suggesting this is in
concrete,'' Simon said.
   David Pratt, the American Insurance Association's vice president
for federal affairs, said negotiation with Metzenbaum would be
pointless.
   ``We're not going to negotiate with him,'' Pratt said. ``I don't
think we'd get very far ... There's no agreement on the basic
premises.''
   Pratt said the so-called ``safe harbors'' in the bill that
shelter some combined endeavors would not work. ``They are
inefective in truly allowing for the joint activities we find vital
to make sure insurance is fairly priced,'' he said.
   Metzenbaum's bill would repeal the insurance industry's
antitrust exemption but allow states to continue individually to
regulate insurance. Under his bill, insurance companies would still
be able to work together, but joint activities would be limited to:
   _Collection and exchange of historical loss data and information
on fraudulent claims.
   _Research for classifying public fire defenses.
   _Preparation of standardized forms.
   The bill also would leave untouched joint underwriting,
state-required residual market mechanisms and pools ``that do not
unreasonably restrain trade.''
   Consumer, banking and small-business groups have been calling
for repeal or amendment of the industry's antitrust exemptions.
   A proposal in the House seeks to narrow those exemptions.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., calls for a ban
on the sharing of information to determine premiums or coverage
areas.
   It also would forbid ``tie-in'' sales, such as a requirement
that a motorist buy a homeowner's policy with the auto policy, and
ban ``any action to impair the availability or affordability of
insurance.
   The insurance industry also opposes that measure, which a Florio
aide said ``has struck a nerve.''
