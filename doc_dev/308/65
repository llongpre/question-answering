   Today is ``Tax Freedom Day,'' the day the
average American taxpayer finishes paying off taxes.
   The Tax Foundation calculates the average American will have to
work 124 days this year _ the same as in 1987 and 1988 _ just to
pay federal, state and local taxes. Today is the 124th day of the
year.
   Tax Freedom Day has never fallen later in the year. This year's
date is also the same as in 1981, before President Reagan and
Congress agreed on a 23-percent across-the-board cut in individual
income tax rates.
   Economists for the foundation, a nonpartisan Washington research
group, say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs.

<NOTE>First Grant Given to Town Near Base That Will Be Closed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The town of Rantoul, Ill., is receiving the
first federal planning grant to help cope with the upcoming round
of military base closings.
   The Defense Department said Wednesday that the community next to
the Chanute Air Force Base will receive $73,045 ``to help organize
a base reuse committee to start planning the civilian conversion of
the base property.''
   In addition to the federal money, Rantoul is contributing money
and services worth $11,300 and the state of Illinois $10,000 to
support the effort.
   The grant to Rantoul is the first since Congress approved a long
list of base closings last month under a special procedure set up
last year. Chanute Air Force Base is one of 86 bases now set for
closure under the program, which was prompted primarily by budget
concerns.

<NOTE>End Urged to Ideological Limits on Travel</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Writers and teachers urged Congress to rescind
laws that allow the government to keep foreigners out of the United
States because of their ideological beliefs.
   They testified Wednesday on a bill by Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., that would gut the McCarran-Walter immigration law and
other laws that allow the federal government to restrict foreign
travel by Americans through limits on the way the dollar can be
spent.
   Novelist Larry McMurtry told the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the
administration of justice the McCarran-Walter act ``abridges the
rights of Americans to engage in face-to-face discussions and
debate with foreign colleagues.''
   Choichiro Yatani, a Japanese who teaches psychology in the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said he was jailed for 44
days and threatened with deportation over suspicions he was a
communist. He said his status in the country ``remains tenuous and
my name remains on the immigration `lookout list.'''
