   WASHINGTON -- An insurance trade group representing 220
property and casualty companies is proposing that the
industry voluntarily limit the antitrust exemptions allowed
it under the 46-year-old McCarran-Ferguson Act.
   The American Insurance Association said it is taking its
proposal to other insurance trade groups in hopes of forming
a consensus to present to Congress. They hope to head off a
bill sponsored by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas) that would
substantially reduce the antitrust exemptions for insurance
companies. Some consumer advocates have tried for years to
get the law trimmed back.

   The trade group's plan would make insurance companies
subject to all antitrust regulations except for four "safe
harbors": data collection, building inspections, development
of standardized policy forms, and joint underwriting and
pooling arrangements. Robert Vagley, president of the
association, calls the proposal a "constructive alternative"
to Mr. Brooks's legislation.
   It remains to be seen whether the industry will line up
behind the proposal. The National Association of Independent
Insurers said it opposes the idea, calling it a "foolhardy
attempt to appease industry critics" and saying it will put
small companies out of business.
