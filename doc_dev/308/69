   Witnesses urged Congress on Wednesday to lift
restrictions that allow the government to keep foreigners out of
the United States because of their ideological beliefs.
   Under the McCarran-Walter immigration law, foreigners may be
kept out for ideological reasons. Other laws allow the federal
government to restrict foreign travel by Americans through limits
on the way the dollar can be spent.
   Novelist Larry McMurtry told the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the
administration of justice that if the McCarran-Walter act
``abridges the rights of Americans to engage in face-to-face
discussions and debate with foreign colleagues.''
   Choichiro Yatani, a Japanese who teaches psychology in the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said he was jailed for 44
days and threatened with deportation over suspicions he was a
communist. He said his status in the country ``remains tenuous and
my name remains on the immigration `lookout list.' ''
   A bill by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., would allow foreigners to
visit the United States regardless of their ideas or what they
might say here.
   The Justice Department has told Frank in a letter that it wants
to keep the authority to prevent the entry of foreigners it
considers undesirable.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., has introduced a bill to end the
currency restrictions that have been used to limit travel by
Americans. He noted that as Americans do not spend their own money,
they are free to travel to Cuba.
   ``This means that Americans can and do travel to Cuba as guests
of a Cuban government eager to present a positive image of life in
Cuba. I find it highly compromising for Americans to be able to
travel to Cuba only on Castro's tab,'' Berman said.
   Loren F. Ghiglione, president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, criticized Vice President Dan Quayle and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the administration's
refusal to admit Cuba's Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega
to address the society's meeting last month.
   Quayle had suggested that Ortega could have been interviewed in
Nicaragua.
   ``If I as the editor of a 7,000 circulation newspaper may be
permitted a somewhat personal response to the vice president's
suggestion, I would remind the committee that the U.S. press is
unlike that of any other nations,'' Ghiglione said in prepared
testimony.
   `It is essentially local-provincial, not national. Half the
country's dailies have a circulation of 20,000 or less. While I and
other small-town editors have made reporting trips to Nicaragua,
the Middle East, southern Africa and other newsworthy parts of the
world, we do not have the resources or clout to travel to Nicaragua
and interview Mr. Ortega on a regular basis.''
   Ghiglione said Americans are hindered in criticizing censorship
elsewhere by what he called ``oppressive and restrictive censorial
authority ... within the United States.''
   Baker, in defending the decision to keep Castro and Ortega from
speaking to the ASNE meeting, said he did not believe the decision
amounted to censorship. He said the government was exercising ``a
certain amount of discretion'' in not issuing visas for the two
Marxist leaders.
