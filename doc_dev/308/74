   A man who wounded six police officers in a wild
shootout that triggered a national manhunt was sentenced Thursday to
five to 15 years on weapons charges stemming from the gun battle.
   Larry Davis, 22, was acquitted of nine counts of attempted murder
in the 1986 gunfight with police in the Bronx, eliciting a firestorm
of criticism from politicians and elected officials.
   A defiant Davis was ringed by eight court officers when the
sentence was handed down.
   Earlier, he had questioned the integrity of Acting State Supreme
Court Justice Bernard Fried, and during a 15-minute speech, he
called Fried his ``persecutor'' and said ``you have violated the law
several times.''
   ``I believe you have tried to pre-try my case ... even though you
are supposed to be neutral,'' he told the judge.
   Davis' attorney, William Kunstler, called it a ``racist
sentence'' and immediately appealed it. Davis must serve at least
five years before parole.
   Davis opened his comments by thanking Allah, his family, friends,
supporters and attorneys. He rolled up his shirtsleeve and pants leg
to show injuries allegedly inflicted by corrections officers.
   ``I am not some racist brutal beast or killer that the drug
trafficking police are trying to paint me as,'' he said. ``I
challenge you to give me the same sentence as you would give your
own son.''
   Fried sat impassively during Davis' speech but called him a
``violent, gun- carrying drug dealer'' as he gave him five to 15
years concurrent on each of two counts of criminal possession of a
weapon with intent to use, and 1 2-3 to five years on three counts
of weapons possession to run concurrent with the five to 15 year
term.
   Fried threw out one weapons conviction because of a legal
technicality.
   Dozens of Davis' supporters attended the hearing, as did several
of the officers shot by Davis, including Detective Thomas McCarren,
who had labeled the verdict acquitting Davis as racist.
   Before sentencing, McCarren told Fried he believed Davis was a
cold-blooded killer with no character.
   Davis was found innocent of the attempted murder counts and six
counts of aggravated assault on Nov. 20 by a Bronx state Supreme
Court jury, his second acquittal in nine months.
   Regardless of the sentence handed down Thursday, Davis will
likely remain in custody pending two more trials. Fried could have
given Davis a maximum of 10 to 20 years on the charges.
   Kunstler had suggested his client should receive no time or the
same sentence as Bernhard Goetz _ six months. Goetz was acquitted of
attempted murder but convicted on weapons charges for the shooting
of four teens on a Manhattan subway train.
   The trial focused on the Nov. 19, 1986, shootout between police
and Davis in his sister's Bronx apartment. Six officers were wounded
in the exchange; Davis escaped unscathed through an adjoining
apartment's window, setting off a 17-day national manhunt.
   Kunstler argued that the police, without a warrant, came to the
apartment intent on killing Davis, who fired in self-defense when
the officers opened fire on him without provocation.
   Prosecutors contended Davis fired first as he resisted arrest by
police seeking him as a suspect in the slayings of four suspected
drug dealers. Davis was acquitted of murder charges in that case on
March 3.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward had
denounced the jury verdict in the second Davis trial in the days
following his acquittal.
   Prior to the sentencing, about 1,500 city police officers
incensed by the David verdict turned out in front of the Bronx
County Courthouse to call for the maximum jail time.
   Davis still faces a murder charge in Manhattan and another in the
Bronx, as well as charges of kidnapping and assault in the Bronx and
car theft on Long Island.
