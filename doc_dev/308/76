   Consumer groups hope election-year politics
will help them overcome insurance companies' lobbying power and win
congressional repeal of the industry's exemption from antitrust
laws.
   The House Judiciary Committee bolstered their effort Wednesday,
approving 19-17 a bill to subject insurance companies to federal
antitrust lawsuits for the first time since 1945.
   Three of the committee's 22 Democrats _ Reps. Dan Glickman of
Kansas, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio _
voted with all 14 Republicans in opposing it.
   The bill would remove the industry's exemption from federal
antitrust laws under the 1945 McCarren-Ferguson Act, which turned
the regulation of insurance companies over to state governments.
   Policyholders who could show that states are not actively
regulating the industry could sue insurance companies and their
agents for price-fixing and other anticompetitive practices.
   ``Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage
severely restricted,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
committee chairman. ``Congress can no longer ignore the widespread
economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high premiums or
policies that are unavailable at any price.''
   In addition to price-fixing, damages could be sought for the
following anticompetitive practices:
   _Allocating territories among competing companies.
   _Monopolization.
   _Forcing consumers to purchase insurance they don't want so they
can buy the kind they do want. An example is requiring the purchase
of a homeowners' policy in order to get auto insurance.
   Consumer groups seeking the legislation for the past 15 years
acknowledged they face an uphill fight. But they voiced optimism
that the committee vote opens the way for a House floor fight that
will draw public attention to the issue.
   ``This represents an important breakthrough,'' said Robert
Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a grassroots consumer
organization claiming 2 million members. ``It demonstrates that an
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industry's
stranglehold over legislators.''
   Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, predicted
the bill will become a major election-year issue once it reaches
the House floor.
   ``Behind food and shelter, insurance is the single largest
expenditure of the year for the average consumer,'' she said.
``Just like the gun lobby, the insurance lobby is no longer being
perceived by Congress as invincible.''
   The bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw
data on claims. But after a five-year transition period, it would
greatly weaken companies' reliance upon the Insurance Services
Office, a New York-based industry organization that now ``advises''
what rates should be charged.
   A similar bill was approved by the panel's economic and
commercial law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an
intensive industry lobbying effort. Democrats said they hope to
bring the new version to the full House in late summer or early
fall.
   Although similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
industry lobbyists say they are counting on Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala., both members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, to prevent it from reaching a floor vote there.
   ``If this bill is enacted into law, it may prove disastrous for
consumers and small insurance companies alike,'' said Lowell Beck,
president of the National Association of Independent Insurers.
``Every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust
counts. Legal costs, which by necessity would be passed on to
consumers, would soar.''
   Lipsen disputed that claim, citing a report by the General
Accounting Office showing that workers' compensation insurance
rates fell by 30 percent in Michigan after its legislature in 1982
repealed a state antitrust exemption for such coverage.
