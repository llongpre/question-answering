FACES 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard that between 20% and 40% (of letters written to members of the 
Reauthorization Committee of the National Endowment for the Arts) are against 
the NEA, I just freaked and decided, hey, this is really important. If we don't 
do something now, it will be too late," said artist and independent curator 
Karen Atkinson, who has taken the current NEA debate to heart by creating a 
pro-reauthorization installation in the Los Angeles Center for Photographic 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson's installation, "Art Protection Services, Karen Atkinson and 
Associates, ARTtorneys for Art," is certainly not your typical art exhibition. 
In fact, a newcomer walking into LACPS might not even know he was entering an 
art space. That's because, thanks to Atkinson, the gallery has become a mock 
lawyer's office set up to fight censorship and other First Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
Included in Atkinson's office are her extensive files of clippings on NEA 
issues, a bookshelf filled with red, white and blue books on "all the things an 
ARTtorney would need to know to defend art," and Atkinson's "degrees" from 
Artists' State University and Los Angeles School of Artists at Law. Also 
included are artworks featuring wordings from Article I of Congress and the 
Official Secrets Act, a looming American Flag and a rack of about 40 different 
postcards created by 20 artists for gallery-goers to sign and send to members 
of the Reauthorization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people that support this issue; but how many people have time 
to sit down and write 42 letters?" Atkinson explained. "Here, we have 
everything available to you at cost -- the (pro-reauthorization) postcards, the 
mailing labels, the stamps -- so people can do in a couple of minutes what it 
would take them days to do at home. I'm hoping it will help, especially since 
the people that are fighting against the NEA are so organized." 
</P>
<P>
As Atkinson tells it, the practical aspects of this exhibition -- getting as 
many postcards as possible signed and sent in to committee members by the time 
the exhibition closes June 15 -- are much more important that the art. But 
that's the whole idea, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something that would really make a difference," said Atkinson, 
34, a CalArts graduate who now teaches at her alma mater. "There's always the 
old saying, and my students always say, 'Art doesn't make a difference; it 
doesn't do any good.' But I'm hoping that it does."

A man in his mid-20s wearing horned-rimmed glasses, talking to an equally 
yuppified female while admiring Rauschenbergs at the Gemini G.E.L. gallery on 
Melrose Avenue at a reception for the Tricia Brown Dance Company: "You know," 
he said looking around the room at older people eyeing the art, sipping white 
wine and talking of their collections, "I won't feel comfortable at these 
things until I'm a collector myself. And that means after the Wharton M.B.A."

Look out for a sleeping dog. Noted Santa Monica-based artist Laddie John Dill 
is offering a reward for the sculpture "Sleeping Dog," which was stolen from 
the walled sculpture garden at his home in early May. The bronze piece, by L.A. 
artist Gwynn Murrill, a personal friend of Dill, is worth $25,000. Pat Faure of 
the Asher/Faure Gallery, which represents Dill, said the artist wants dealers 
to be aware that the sculpture is at large in case they encounter someone 
trying to sell it. Anyone with information can call Asher/Faure at (213) 
271-3665.

HAPPENING

The ears as well as the eyes will confront AIDS issues when poetry readings 
accompany an art exhibit at the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Art 
Park. The poetry is written by eight Los Angeles poets whose lives and works 
have been affected by the disease. The poets will read their works in a program 
called "A Fury of Words" on May 26 and June 9. The readings, by Mark Haile, Bia 
Lowe, Gil Cuadros and others go along with the dual art exhibit, "The 
Indomitable Spirit" and "Raging at the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angles," 
which runs until June 24 at the gallery, 4800 Hollywood Blvd. Information: 
(213) 485-4581.

ETC. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery exhibition of the same 
title, "The Indomitable Spirit," a new limited edition portfolio of 10 
previously unpublished photographs is available in Los Angeles at BlumHelman 
Gallery. The portfolio features works by John Baldessari, Chuck Close, Jan 
Groover, Annette Lemieux, Duane Michals, Richard Prince, Robert Rauschenberg, 
Cindy Sherman, Bruce Weber and William Wegman, and is available in an edition 
of 50 plus 15 artist's proofs. Proceeds from sales of the portfolio, available 
in a number of galleries nationwide, benefit the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research and the National Community AIDS Partnership.

Los Angeles-based sculptor and media artist Barbara McCarren has been selected 
as the first artist to have work acquired by the L.A. County Museum of Art 
under the Marvin B. Meyer Family Endowment. Income from the $50,000 endowment, 
established in 1989, will provide for the acquisition of one work by an 
emerging artist from the Los Angeles area each year. For the first acquisition, 
McCarren will create a new work to be installed this summer.

L.A. artists who want to say it on a billboard can submit their work to the 
third annual ArtBulletin Program by June 29. Judges will select three artists 
whose work will be reproduced on 14-by-48-foot billboards. The billboard spaces 
will be donated by Patrick Media Group Inc., which is co-sponsoring the program 
with LACE. Since the billboards will be on city streets for public viewing, a 
spokeswoman for the contest reminds artists to do something that uses the 
outdoor medium and catches the attention of people driving by. Each winner will 
receive a $750 honorarium. Last year's winning billboards included one by 
artist May Sun depicting the student demonstration in China's Tian An Men 
Square. Information: (213) 731-5111.

Artists interested in workin' on the railway can contact the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission by June 15. The commission is searching for one 
artist to create a permanent work for the Metro Blue Line tunnel, which will go 
from under Flower Street to the 7th Street station. Artists should plan on 
incorporating light and reflective materials and creating an installation 
designed for a moving audience. The budget for the project is $325,000. Artists 
may work alone or in teams. Information: (213) 236-9556.

Art gets down to earth as ART/LA90 joins with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in a project called "Art for Earth's Sake." The sponsors of the annual 
ART/LA90 event in Los Angeles have announced a liaison with the environmental 
action group, and has selected the organization as the beneficiary for the 1990 
Gala Preview to be held in December at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
Artists, collectors and galleries will participate.

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
The glowing letter "W" sits atop the Woman's Building as a rallying point for 
women. "In a few short strokes, I tried to distill what I see as a 
representation of women," said artist Eve King-Lehman of her colorful and 
grand-scaled sculpture. "I came up with the letter as the first letter of the 
word woman, of course, but it also stands for the West, where we are, which 
gives off an exploratory kind of energy." 
</P>
<P>
King-Lehman's piece is part of the face-lift the building at 1727 N. Spring St. 
received when three works were added to its exterior as part of the "Gilding 
the Building" project last week. She was chosen to adorn the building's walls 
along with artists Norma D'Andrea and Barbara Romain by jurors Sheila De 
Bretteville and Betye Saar. 
</P>
<P>
King-Lehman created a work that "reflected how the Woman's Building sees 
itself." To the artist, the building feels full of "explosive energy. And it 
has a strong connection to nature." As a result, she said she used colors from 
nature -- deep blues and earthy tones -- within the W. 
</P>
<P>
She illuminated her W with florescent lights to attract attention to it. "It's 
bright so I could easily share it with all women, and with the outside world 
who passes the building," she said of her first public commission. 
</P>
<P>
"And the lines of the W, which arch up from the building to the sky, symbolize 
a positive future for women," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Artist D'Andrea's piece is also devoted to the future. Located at the entrance 
to the building, it's a three-paneled etched glass structure of an artist 
drawing in front of a planet while she maps out her future. 
</P>
<P>
Romain has done a frieze that runs across the entire building. The piece, 
called "Las Angelinas," was a community project put together by local woman 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the Woman's Building . . . let Imogen Cunningham, the 20th-Century 
photographer, tell you about her works in her own voice. In a film by her 
granddaughter, filmmaker Meg Partridge, Cunningham discusses her photos. The 
28-minute film is based on interviews with Cunningham when she was in her late 
80s. "Portrait of Imogen" can be seen in the Video Gallery until June 30.
