   A House subcommittee approved legislation
Wednesday to scale back exemptions from federal antitrust laws the
insurance industry has enjoyed for 45 years.
   On a 9-6 partisan vote, the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee
on economic and commercial law approved a bill to subject insurance
companies to federal court lawsuits for price fixing and other
antitrust provisions.
   All Democrats on the panel voted for the bill and all
Republicans voted against it.
   Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from
antitrust suits under the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act, which
delegated regulation of the now $500 billion industry to state
governments.
   The bill clearing its first legislative hurdle Wednesday was
prompted by the 1985 insurance upheaval in which companies quit
writing liability coverage for various occupations because of
massive claims and judgments against them.
   A similar bill was approved by the subcommittee in 1988 but got
nowhere because of intense opposition from the insurance industry.
   This time, however, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the full
committee's new chairman, is determined to bring a bill to the
House floor.
   Citing opponents' claims that the industry is so competitive
that no antitrust laws are needed, Brooks said Wednesday, ``If
that's so, then there is nothing to fear'' from the bill.
   In addition to price fixing, the legislation would, after a
five-year transition, make other alleged abuses by insurance
companies grounds for federal antitrust lawsuits.
   They include dividing up geographic territories among competing
companies and ``tying'' requirements, such as forcing a buyer to
purchase home insurance in order to get auto coverage.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has introduced similar
legislation in the Senate. However, the industry is counting on
opposition from Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin,
D-Ala. _ both, along with Metzenbaum, members of the Senate's
judiciary committee _ to prevent its passage.
