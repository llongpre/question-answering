   Bally Manufacturing Corp., which owns gaming
properties in Nevada and New Jersey, announced plans Tuesday to
build an estimated $10 million gaming equipment plant in Las Vegas.
   The plant will manufacture gaming machines and lottery terminals.
Completion of the 150,000-square-foot facility at the Huges Airport
Center near McCarran International Airport is scheduled by mid-1990.
   The plant initially will provide jobs for up to 300 people.
   ``It makes sense to be a gaming manufacturer in a gaming state,''
said Bally President Roger Keesee.
   Keesee said rail and air transportation were added factors in
selecting the Las Vegas site.
   Bally is a $2 billion company that designs, makes and markets
leisure and recreation products. Chicago-based Bally operates casino
hotels in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and has two properties in
Atlantic City, N.J.
