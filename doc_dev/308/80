   Insurance industry groups are accusing
consumer organizations of using distorted statistics to support
their arguments that industry inefficiency costs motorists up to
$20 billion a year in increased premiums.
   Five consumer groups, outlining a program they said could save
the average household as much as $277 a year on car insurance, said
Monday the most important proposed changes were aimed at reducing
insurer waste and inefficiency.
   In particular, the consumer groups said they want measures taken
to increase competition in auto insurance markets and to correct
``the industry's cost pass-through methods of rate-making, under
which profits rise with costs.''
   ``The enactment of such measures has the potential to reduce the
up to $20 billion in insurer waste and inefficiency by $8 billion
to $12 billon a year,'' the organizations said.
   Lowell R. Beck, president of the National Association of
Independent Insurers, responded, ``The $20 billion figure of
industry waste is drawn out of the air and is totally without proof
or foundation.''
   The American Insurance Association, in a separate statement,
said, ``The allegations of insurer inefficiency are based on
distorted statistics. In fact, insurers are efficient when compared
to many other industries, such as banking. The alleged inefficiency
is a smokescreen to prevent control of runaway lawsuit costs which
neither insurers nor consumers can afford.''
   The Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, National
Insurance Consumer Organization, U.S. Public Interest Research
Group and Public Citizen announced their proposal at a news
conference.
   ``This program is demanding but feasible,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, a group associated with consumer
advocate Ralph Nader. ``It should be embraced by the auto insurance
industry.''
   The proposal calls for repeal of antitrust exemptions for the
insurance industry that are contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
passed in 1945. It also calls for the repeal of state laws
prohibiting group sales and discounts by agents.
   It proposes measures to make more price information available to
consumers and the establishment of independent advocates to
represent the consumer point of view in government rate proceedings.
   The proposal also calls for requiring safety features in light
trucks and vans, widespread installation of airbags, increased use
of safety belts, and motorcycle-helmet laws.
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation of
America, said the report ``explains how to lower auto insurance
rates by $15 billion to $23 billion.''
   ``This would save the average household $181 to $277,'' Brobeck
said.
