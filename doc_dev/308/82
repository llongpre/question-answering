   Your July 10 editorial on health insurance and your article on auto insurance rates lamented high-cost insurance. 
No substantive reasons were put forth to explain why insurance premiums continue to escalate. 

   Perhaps The Wall Street Journal should revisit, by editorial and analytical reporting, the reasons for and the background on why insurance companies enjoy exemption from federal antitrust statutes. 

   The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 exempts the insurance industry from antitrust laws. 
A cornerstone of journalism is its obligation to educate. 
I suggest that you have an obligation to remind your readers that the power to regulate insurance companies resides with state insurance commissioners. 
Hence, we have a nearly $400 billion industry accounting for about 13% of disposable income accountable to 50 separate insurance overseers. 
The probability of consistency is illusive and ethereal. 

   As a retired physician, I remain convinced that the 50 state insurance commissioners cannot police the insurance industry as effectively as the federal government under antitrust authority. 
Too much is at stake to believe otherwise. 
I oppose federal regulations in principle, except where such a large amount of disposable income is at stake.
