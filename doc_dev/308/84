A bill repealing many of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust 
laws was approved Wednesday by the House Judiciary Committee over unanimous 
Republican opposition. 
</P>
<P>
On a 19-17 vote, the panel voted to open insurance companies to antitrust 
lawsuits for price-fixing, attempted monopolizing, allocating territories among 
rival companies or forcing consumers to buy insurance they do not want to 
qualify for coverage that they do. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the committee's 22 Democrats, Reps. Dan Glickman of Kansas, Bruce 
Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio, voted with all of the 14 
Republicans in opposing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from antitrust suits 
since 1945 under the McCarran-Feguson Act, which delegated regulation of the 
now $500-billion-a-year industry to state governments. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and others have complained since the mid-1970s that lax 
oversight by some states has permitted the companies to use anti-competitive 
practices to deny coverage and raise rates dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all sizes have found 
their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage severely restricted," said Rep. 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), the judiciary committee's chairman. "Congress can no 
longer ignore the widespread economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high 
premiums or policies that are unavailable at any price." 
</P>
<P>
The federal antitrust prohibitions would not apply in states with "active" 
regulatory programs.
