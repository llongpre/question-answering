   Rain and snow prevailed for much of the nation today after a
storm dumped 6 inches of snow on South Dakota, lightning killed a
teen-ager in Colorado and a small plane crashed on takeoff at a
snow-choked Arizona airport.
   Lightning struck and killed 14-year-old Bonnie Card of
Westminster, Colo., and injured another 14-year-old girl as
turbulent weather pummeled the state Thursday, with winds gusting
to near 60 mph, golfball-sized hail and a short-lived tornado was
reported north of Denver.
   In Arizona, a twin engine Gallup Air Transport airplane hit a
small snow drift on takeoff and crashed on the tarmac Thursday
morning at Flagstaff's Pulliam Airport. The airport had about 6 to
7 inches of snow on the ground. No injuries were reported.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell in parts of eastern and northern
South Dakota Thursday with more precipitation expected statewide
today. A winter storm watch was posted today for the southern
portion of the state.
   Snow was scattered early today in extreme western Nebraska and
into Wyoming. Up to 4 inches of snow was reported at Yellowstone
National Park and as much as 3 to 5 inches of snow was expected

Tennessee Valleys; thunderstorms over the Gulf Coast states; rain
mixed with snow from northern Wisconsin across southern Minnesota
and South Dakota to northwest Nebraska; snow scattered across the

Valley to Wyoming and over northern Arizona; the 70s or 80s over
the southeast quarter of the nation and the southern Great Plains;
