   The Consumer Product Safety Commission has
warned that a half-million weed trimmers made by Black &amp; Decker
Corp. that could pose an electrocution hazard remain in consumer
hands, despite an earlier recall.
   The safety agency said Tuesday it issued the new warning because
of a lower than expected return rate for the trimmers.
   Involved are Black &amp; Decker Model 82209 and Model 82210
bump-feed string trimmers used on grass and weeds.

   The state attorneys general of New York,
Massachusetts and Texas have urged Congress to repeal the insurance
industry's federal antitrust exemption.
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed in 1945, grants the antitrust
exemption. A number of states have filed suit claiming that dozens
of insurance companies, under the guise of the exemption, conspired
to create the liability insurance crisis of 1985-86. Insurance
during that time period became unavailable or too costly for many
governments and businesses.

   Tobacco companies have gone on the offensive
to counter fallout from their first loss of a cigarette liability
case.
   Industry lawyers Tuesday attacked the impartiality of the judge
in the four-month trial that on Monday held a cigarette maker
partly responsible for a smoker's lung cancer and awarded $400,000
in damages to her widower.
   They also argued that greed, not principle, drives attorneys who
sue their $35 billion-a-year industry. And they released a detailed
rebuttal of previously secret industry documents introduced by
anti-smoking forces during the trial.

   The Reagan administration's go-slow approach
to revamping regulation of the stock and futures markets has
received a warm reception from the House Agriculture Committee.
   A top-level administration policy group previously heard its
work after the October stock market crash criticized by Senate
Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., and others.
   But House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, on Tuesday praised its members for their ``political
courage'' last month in recommending preservation, for the most
part, of the regulatory status quo.

   A big block of Texaco Inc. stock has changed
hands, but it was unknown who participated in the sale or what it
might mean for the impending proxy showdown between the oil giant
and financier Carl C. Icahn.
   The New York Stock Exchange reported Tuesday that 7,696,300
shares, representing 3.2 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares
outstanding, sold at $50.25 per share.
   Some analysts said the buyer may have been Icahn, who has
offered to buy the Texaco shares he does not already own for $60 a
share. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., an investment firm known to
have held a 4.9 percent stake in Texaco, was seen as a likely
seller.

   The stock market rallied on a better-than-expected trade report
Tuesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 25.07
points to close at 2,124.47, a post-crash high.
   Long-term government bond yields fell to two-month lows.
   The dollar leaped in value against most major foreign
currencies, also in response to the trade report.
   Corn futures prices soared the maximum allowed for daily trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade as long-range weather forecasts
fanned fears of drought damage to the U.S. crop. Other grain and
soybean futures also advanced.
