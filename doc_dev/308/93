   Severe thunderstorms socked the Midwest and upper Mississippi
Valley early today, bringing large hail, high wind and heavy rain to
parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
   The storms dumped up to 7 inches of rain on northern Illinois,
knocking out power to thousands of homes and slowing travel in the
Chicago area.
   The water disrupted commuter buses and trains in Chicago, with 17
viaducts flooded on the southwest side, said Joe Daquilante, a
superintendant for the Chicago Transit Authority.
   American Airlines canceled about 40 flights that were scheduled
to leave O'Hare International Airport between 7 a.m. and 8:40 a.m.
CDT, said spokesman Tom Stack. ``A lot of that was not just because
of the storms this morning _ we still had disruptions from the
weather the night before,'' Stack said, noting that flooding around
the airport had virtually closed off much ground traffic.
   United Airlines canceled a total of 75 departures and arrivals
today at O'Hare, spokesman Rob Doughty said.
   Wind gusted to 60 mph near Rockford, Ill., to 55 mph in
Rochester, Minn., and to 52 mph at Minneapolis.
   The wind downed trees at Sharon, Wis., near the Illinois line,
and gusts blew out the windows of a house at Monon, Ind. High winds
also damaged houses at Buffalo, Ind.
   Over an inch of rain fell in a short period of time in parts of
Indiana, including Kokomo and Muncie.
   Elsewhere, 1} inches fell at Lacrosse, Wis., in about an hour.
Heavy rain flooded streets at Waseca, Minn., and at Genoa City, Wis.
   Isolated severe thunderstorms struck southwest Texas, and a few
showers and thunderstorms were over northwest Kansas and eastern
Colorado. Thunderstorms also brought heavy rain to parts of Florida
Thursday night.
   Clear skies prevailed this morning across most of the nation,
including almost all of the West and much of the Southeast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the Mississippi Valley across the Appalachians to portions of
the East Coast; numerous showers and thunderstorms from the Upper
Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes region to portions of northern New
England; scattered showers and thunderstorms over Oklahoma,
northwest Texas and New Mexico; a few showers across western
sections of Washington and Oregon.
   Predicted highs: in the 70s from the Pacific Northwest across
Montana, the Dakotas and much of the Great Lakes to northern New
England; in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast, near the shores
of Lake Superior and over portions of Maine; around the 100 degree
mark over portions of Texas; between 100 and 110 degrees in the
Desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s across much of the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at Yellowstone,
Wyo., to 92 degrees at Phoenix.
