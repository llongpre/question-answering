   High winds and heavy snow swept into the Dakotas today from a
storm that left up to 4 feet of snow in the Western mountains, and
forecasters said the front would move east toward the Great Lakes
by tonight.
   ``Near blizzard conditions, that's what it's like in the western
Dakotas,'' Karl Swanberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Minneapolis, said early today. ``It's gusting 50 mph,
producing near zero visibility'' around Rapid City, S.D.
   Winter storm warnings were posted for today for parts of
Colorado, North and South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Gale
warnings were posted for Lake Ontario.
   Advisories for snow with gusty winds were posted for tonight for
parts of Montana, Wyoming, Iowa, the Dakotas, Minnesota and
Wisconsin.
   Winter storm watches were posted for today and tonight for upper
Michigan.
   The storm brings high winds with it. Winds gusted to more than
60 mph in Utah on Sunday and to 55 mph in Las Vegas.
   Snow fell into Sunday evening in northern Maine and northern
Vermont and along the eastern end of Lake Ontario. Snow also fell
in north central California and east central Nevada and from
eastern Washington across the Idaho Panhandle and the western
two-thirds of Montana, western Wyoming and northern Utah.
   Rainshowers reached from southwestern South Dakota across the
Nebraska Panhandle, southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado, over
southeast Louisiana and the southern half of the Florida Peninsula.
   Thunderstorms over western Oregon left small hail at Troutdale
during the late afternoon.
   The National Weather Service said Donner Summit at Truckee,
Calif., got 13 inches of snow Friday and another 38 inches Saturday
and early Sunday. In Utah, Alta had 25 inches of snow by
mid-afternoon Sunday.
   High temperature for the nation Sunday was 88 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.
