   Flash-flood warnings were posted in mountain and desert sections
of California and Arizona today after monsoonal showers and
thunderstorms closed roads and overturned trucks and parked
airplanes.
   ``This is worse than when it snowed'' last Christmas, police Lt.
Richard Miranda said in Tucson, Ariz., as emergency workers
grappled with weather-related problems Tuesday.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell today from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the Tennessee Valley, and rain fell along the
East Coast from southern New England to the Carolinas.
   The storms in the Southwest on Tuesday brought heavy rain and
strong, gusty winds to parts of Arizona and California. Winds
peaked at 64 mph in Tucson, and 1{ inches of rain fell in just half
an hour in Ehrenburg near the California line.
   In Arizona, a Tucson man and his stepson were stranded in the
middle of the swollen Santa Cruz River until a Department of Public
Safety helicopter rescued them, authorities said.
   At Tucson International Airport, the storm overturned two small
planes, broke winds and propellers on three large cargo planes and
blew off hangar roofs and doors, said spokeswoman Vicki Mathews.
Damage was estimated at $750,000. The storm also downed trees and
power lines.
   In Southern California, strong winds overturned three trucks and
closed Interstate 10. Flooding closed Highway 95 from Needles to
the Nevada line about 20 miles to the north.
   Storms in Texas on Tuesday dropped one-inch hail on Beaverdams
and generated winds that downed trees near Clarksville and Maud.
   In the Pacific Northwest, hot weather melted high-temperature
records for the date. It was 102 degrees in Salem, Ore., where the
old record of 96 was set in 1934. Records also fell in Portland and
Eugene, Ore., and at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the mountains and deserts of the Southwest, with storms most
numerous over Arizona, and from east Texas to the Gulf Coast
states, Florida and the Atlantic Coast, with rain widespread from
eastern Virginia to New England.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 80s and 90s across
much of the nation, the 60s over New England and Upper Michigan,
the 70s from Minnesota to Lower Michigan and the Middle Atlantic
States, the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast, near 100 degrees
in central Texas, the central valleys of California and inland
Oregon and Washington state; and between 100 and 110 across the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 90 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.
