<HEAD>Reports: Disney Negotiating Purchase of `Muppets' Companies</HEAD>

   The Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates
Inc. declined comment Wednesday on reports that Disney is
negotiating to buy the group of companies controlled by Jim Henson,
who created ``The Muppet Show.''
   The proposed deal for Henson Associates Inc. calls for Henson to
operate a production company in Los Angeles under the Disney
umbrella, The Hollywood Reporter said.
   The entertainment trade daily quoted an unidentified source
Monday as saying the value of the deal could exceed $100 million.
The Wall Street Journal carried a similar story Wednesday but said
it had been unable to determine a price.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun and Henson spokeswoman Susan Berry
declined to comment, but analysts said the Henson characters Miss
Piggy, Kermit the Frog and the other Muppets, stars of several
movies as well as TV, would fit in perfectly with Disney's Mickey
Mouse and his cohorts.
   The Muppets are probably second only to Disney's characters in
worldwide recognition, said Jeff Logsdon of the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co.
brokerage in Los Angeles.
   ``Obviously it's a franchise that extends Disney's already deep
penetration into the children's market, if it turns out to be
true,'' Logsdon said.
   ``It makes a lot of sense in terms of both companies,'' said
Harold Vogel, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
   ``Disney could use the extra characters and could merchandise
them more effectively than anyone else, and Henson has a lot of
overhead,'' Vogel said. ``Disney's distribution network would be
especially helpful for them.''
   Henson Associates, based in New York, includes Henson
International Television, which controls rights to ``The Muppet
Show,'' a videocassette label, and merchandising, licensing and
publishing divisions.
   Besides ``The Muppet Show,'' the company has produced and
distributed such programs as ``Fraggle Rock,'' ``The Storyteller''
and ``Muppet Babies,'' all successful internationally.
   Henson has distributed such shows as ``The Adventures of Teddy
Ruxpin'' on behalf of others, and last year, ``The Jim Henson Hour''
was broadcast briefly on NBC-TV, but was pulled before the end of
its run.
   The Muppets would join quite a menagerie of characters Disney has
introduced over the past two years: Roger Rabbit and the fall
release ``The Little Mermaid'' in animated movies; the top-rated
``Duck Tales'' and coming out this fall, ``Chip &amp; Dale Rescue
Rangers'' on afternoon TV.
   There's all kinds of combinations you could extend,'' Logsdon
mused. ``The Little Mermaid dates Kermit the Frog. ... They get
saved by Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers ...''
