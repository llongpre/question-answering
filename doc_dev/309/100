   The news about Queen Leona may have caused a stir
in King Michael's court.
   While the conviction of hotel billionairess Leona Helmsley on tax
cheating charges doesn't directly affect the predicament plaguing
junk-bond king Michael Milken, it was not a good week for people
charged with white-collar crimes.
   In addition to Leona, TV evangelist Jim Bakker collapsed in an
apparent breakdown during his fraud and conspiracy trial this past
week; stock speculator Salim B. Lewis pleaded guilty to securities
fraud charges; and a Chicago lawyer was sentenced to the
longest-ever prison term for insider trading.
   All of those events sent ominous signals about what Milken risks
if his case goes to trial. Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond unit, has pleaded innocent to 98
counts of securities fraud and racketeering.
   Like Milken, all four defendants in these other cases were
extremely wealthy _ Helmsley is one of the world's richest women.
All were accused of crimes that reflected arrogance, greed and
unbridled excess.
   Perhaps more important, the judicial process in the cases of
Helmsley and the attorney Alfred Elliott showed that judges and
juries are quite willing to punish white-collar felons as harshly as
suspects convicted for violent crimes.
   That fact may have played a role in the decision by Lewis to
strike a deal with federal prosecutors in New York and plead guilty
to three felonies for stock manipulation. Lewis originally had
asserted innocence and his lawyers had called his indictment ``a
piece of garbage.''
   Although jurors in the highly publicized Helmsley trial aquitted
her of the most serious charges, they were swayed by evidence that
she flaunted the tax laws to cheat the government of $1.2 million by
using falsified bills.
   In a case laced with the poetic-justice atmosphere of the French
Revolution's backlash against the rich, Mrs. Helmsley faces the
prospect of a prison stint, her designer clothes doffed for an
inmate jumpsuit, her luxurious staterooms sacrificed for a skinny
bunk mattress.
   To Milken and other prospective defendants in securities-fraud
cases, the punishment given to Elliott may have been even more
unsettling. The Chicago lawyer, who represented firms involved in
takeovers, was sentenced to five years in prison for trading stocks
on secret corporate information to make more than $600,000 in
illicit profits.
   That term is a record for insider trading and is two years longer
than the term given Ivan F. Boesky, considered the most notorious
inside trader in Wall Street history, who paid the government $100
million to settle his case and whose subsequent cooperation led to
the Milken indictment.
   Milken's trial isn't expected to start until next year, and the
possibility exists that he could strike a plea bargain. But there
was one intriguing disclosure this past week that suggested he might
fight to the end.
   The Washington Post quoted a secret Securities and Exchange
Commission memo as saying Boesky and Milken conferred in July 1986
about how to conceal a $5.3 million payment, the heart of the
government's case against Milken.
   The SEC memo raised the possibility that Boesky may have been
cooperating with the government at the time of the alleged
rendezvous with Milken and may have been ordered to entrap him. If
so, Milken's lawyers may have a powerful new tool to discredit the
government's case.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government reports on the economy were generally favorable, but
one private report was less optimistic. The Labor Department said
unemployment steadied in August at 5.2 percent and revised the June
and July job-growth figures upward. At the same time, the National
Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic
statistics suggested a serious slowdown in August.
   _Japan's pre-eminence in the world banking industry and its
rapidly growing image as a stock-fraud playground were reinforced by
the merger of Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., which would
create the second-largest banking company behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank Ltd. Immediately after the merger was disclosed, Japanese
securities regulators said they were checking suspicous trades of
stock in the two banks prior to the announcement.
   _Takeover rumors and counter-rumors roiled the airline industry,
centering on new or revised bids for United, American and
Continental that could include foreign-airline partners.
   _The merger &amp; acquisitions business also extended into the
children's entertainment industry, where Walt Disney Co. acquired
Henson Associates Inc., owner of the Muppet characters. The deal
adds Kermit and Miss Piggy to the Mickey Mouse club.
