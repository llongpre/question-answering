<TEXT>     The lawsuit, announced by Henson Associates in a statement, seeks to stop
Disney "from performing, advertising, merchandising and acting in any way that
suggests Disney owns or has any rights to the Muppets.";    Henson is also
trying to prevent Disney from its upcoming springtime opening of "Kermit the
Frog Presents: Muppet Vision 3-D," a theatrical production slated for Disney
World in Orlando, Fla. The statement said the production was Jim Henson's last
major work.;    Disney spokesman Erwin Okun said the company had no immediate
comment.;    Henson Associates is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.; 
  Henson and Disney had been in protracted merger talks, but those
negotiations ended in failure last December.;    "Today's lawsuit is the
result of Disney's continued use of the Muppets despite its failure through
negotiations to obtain a license," the statement said.;    Henson Associates
is based in Los Angeles with offices in New York and London and is owned by
the estate and children of Jim Henson, who died last year of pneumonia at the
age of 53.;    Disney makes motion pictures and television productions, owns
amusement parks and engages in a variety of related businesses.  </TEXT>
