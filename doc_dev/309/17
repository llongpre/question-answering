   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. and Jim Henson
Productions Inc., as expected, announced a home-video
alliance in which Disney will distribute Henson
videocassettes world-wide for five to six years.
   Videocassettes of movies and TV shows from the Henson
video library will be distributed by Disney's Buena Vista
Home Video division under a new video label, Jim Henson Home
Video. The deal also includes international TV rights for the
Henson library.

   The agreement could translate into tens of millions of
dollars in revenue, but neither company would disclose profit
estimates. The companies only described the deal as a
"multimillion-dollar" arrangement.
   Brian Henson, president and chief executive officer of Jim
Henson Productions, said releases will include movies never
before released on video as well as TV shows and new
made-for-video productions. Executives involved in the new
venture said the releases probably will begin next fall and
be priced for retail sales.
   Jim Henson created well-loved and recognizable characters
including Muppet characters such as Miss Piggy and Kermit the
Frog. The Henson library contains feature films, some of
which have been released on video previously, including "The
Muppet Movie," "The Great Muppet Caper" and "Dark Crystal."
The TV series in the library include "The Muppet Show,"
"Muppet Babies" and "Fraggle Rock."
