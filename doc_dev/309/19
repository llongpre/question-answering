   Walt Disney Co. and the family of the late
Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, broke off talks after failing
to reach agreement in Disney's 18-month bid to acquire Henson
Associates Inc.
   Disney also had sought an exclusive production agreement in the
deal valued at $100 million to $150 million.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney chairman
Michael D. Eisner said Thursday.
   Erwin Okun, a Disney Co. vice president, said it was too early
to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude the two
companies from attempting future joint productions. He noted that
statements issued by both companies were cordial.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Associates since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected by the termination of talks.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series, ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose''; a television sitcom involving dinosaurs,
to be aired in January on ABC; and a 3-D film visitors would see at
Walt Disney World in Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could not reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, the genius behind such characters as Kermit the Frog and
Miss Piggy, founded his production company in 1958 as Muppets Inc.
to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson died of pneumonia May 18.
   Industry analysts at first speculated that Henson's death
lessened the value of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents
formed part of Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet
characters with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.
