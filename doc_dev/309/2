Kermit and many of the other Muppets will be joining ranks with Mickey Mouse 
and his friends in a business agreement announced today by Walt Disney World 
and Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
Henson and Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney Co., 
have signed an agreement in principle for Disney to acquire Henson Associates 
Inc., including its film and television library, Disney said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
It did not mention a price. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes agreements for Henson to do long-term consulting and 
production. The announcement said he will produce motion pictures, network and 
off-network TV shows, Disney Channel specials and series, and made-for-home 
video programming. 
</P>
<P>
Also included are special Muppet attractions and rides for Disney theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
Work is already under way for the first such project, a Muppet film attraction 
using 3-D technology. The attraction, to open next spring at the Disney-MGM 
Studios Theme Park here, will be a collaboration between Henson and Walt Disney 
Imagineering. 
</P>
<P>
In the release, Eisner hailed the proposal as "a business association made in 
family entertainment heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, winner of several Emmy awards, introduced Kermit the Frog and other 
Muppets to TV in the 1950s. His library includes the TV shows "The Muppet 
Show," "Fraggle Rock," and "Muppet Babies" and the films "The Muppet Movie," 
"The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Dark Crystal." 
</P>
<P>
Henson's puppet segments and characters created for "Sesame Street," including 
Big Bird, aren't included in the agreement, the release said.
