   The family of the late Muppet
master Jim Henson expects to expand the use of his characters in
Walt Disney Co. theme parks and films.
   ``I'm sure this is just a beginning,'' Henson's widow Jane said
Friday at the opening of a new live-character Muppets musical show
at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
   ``We all want so much for the characters to live and live and
live,'' she added. ``And this is the right place to do it.''
   Henson and the company were negotiating an agreement to broaden
use of the Muppets by Disney when he died, Disney chairman Michael
Eisner said at a news conference Friday.
   Henson's oldest son, Brian, said his father ``really felt that
this is the ideal place for his work to end up. ... We just hope
that our association flourishes.''
   ``None of us have any reason to believe we won't proceed as
planned,'' Eisner told reporters.
   Henson died May 16 after a bout with pneumonia. He was 53.
