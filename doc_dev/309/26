   BURBANK, Calif. -- It isn't exactly Sonny and Cher getting
back together, but in an entertainment industry
reconciliation almost as hard to believe, Walt Disney Co. and
Jim Henson Productions Inc. are expected to announce a major
home-video alliance today, individuals close to the companies
say.
   Under the agreement, Disney's powerful home-video division
will distribute Henson videocassettes for five to six years,
which could translate into tens of millions of dollars in
revenue. Neither company would comment on the transaction,
but Disney has scheduled a news conference for today.

   At first glance, the reunion seems bizarre, because the
breakup of Disney's planned purchase of Henson last year was
so ugly and so public. An angry exchange of lawsuits and
press interviews saw each side accusing the other of greed
and bad faith, and the episode quickly turned into a
public-relations fiasco for both companies.
   Though some joint projects between the two companies
continued -- such as the TV show "Dinosaurs" and a Muppets
3-D film at Walt Disney World -- many industry executives and
analysts believed it would be impossible for the two to
overcome their acrimony.
   But individuals close to the companies said Los
Angeles-based Henson was upset with some of Disney's
corporate executives, not with its operational people in
theme parks, television and home video. "The marriage between
Henson and Disney made a lot of sense in the first place,"
says one executive familiar with the situation. "That
fundamental fact didn't change when things broke apart."
   Home video was a big reason the two companies wanted to
get together initially. As a somewhat sleepy family company
built by the gifted puppeteer who founded it, Henson
Productions first began seeking a Hollywood home-video deal
in 1989, and had been close to signing up with Paramount
Communications Inc. Henson's film and television programming
library, with well-loved, recognizable characters such as the
Muppets, was underexploited, while the market for
videocassettes geared to children was exploding.
   Then, Jim Henson and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner hit it
off personally, and talks began about an outright acquisition
by Disney. Disney agreed to buy the company in 1989 for about
$150 million. But final negotiations dragged on for months,
and Mr. Henson died unexpectedly, with ownership of his
company reverting to his five children.
   Talks began to deteriorate, then broke off over tax and
compensation issues. In April, Henson Productions filed a
lawsuit against Disney, charging it with copyright and
trademark infringement and fraud. Disney countersued, but the
sides settled soon after. The agreement gave Disney only
limited theme-park use of the Henson characters, keeping the
valuable franchise unencumbered in case Henson seeks another
buyer.
   The video agreement preserves the same independence. When
the pact expires, all rights will revert to Henson. At
Henson's request, the videocassettes will be released with a
Jim Henson logo; the cassette packaging won't bear the Disney
name, mentioning only Disney's Buena Vista distribution unit
in small letters, according to people with knowledge of the
agreement.
   Disney took a similar low-profile approach in its recent
successful release of old "Rocky and Bullwinkle" television
episodes from the Jay Ward Productions library, using its
marketing prowess to score an unexpectedly large home-video
hit.
   Disney also is expected to bankroll as many as three new
Henson productions a year for direct video release, as well
as distribute "Fraggle Rock," "The Storyteller," "Muppet
Babies," "The Muppet Show," "Mother Goose" and other Henson
productions.
   Though Disney isn't the largest video distributor, it is
the leader in videos for children and in the often-related
business of selling videos directly to consumers rather than
to video stores for the rental market.
   "Disney is perfect for Henson," says a person who knows
both companies. "This shows the way things might have been."
