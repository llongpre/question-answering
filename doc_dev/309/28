<LEADPARA>  Walt Disney Co., responding to accusations it illegally used Muppet
characters, has filed a counterclaim against Henson Associates seeking
unspecified damages. Disney's counterclaim, filed Monday in federal court in
Manhattan, denies allegations made in a lawsuit by Henson and accuses the
plaintiff of being less interested in protecting Jim Henson's legacy than in
making money. The Muppet inventor and company founder died last May of
pneumonia. The Henson lawsuit filed last week seeks to block the entertainment
giant's allegedly unauthorized use of Muppet characters in its television
commercials, movies, T-shirts and other Disney products. Disney has agreed not
to open a Disney World film featuring the famous characters until after the
trial, scheduled to begin May 13. "Kermit the Frog Presents: Muppet Vision
3-D" will not debut until May 24 the earliest, Disney said.  </LEADPARA>
