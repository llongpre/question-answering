   With the death of puppeteer Jim Henson, creator
and alter ego of Kermit the Frog and scores of other Muppet
characters, it is like a room crowded with old friends has fallen
suddenly silent.
   Kermit cut a heroic figure for this age, a bemused voice of
reason in an absurd world. ``It's not easy being green,'' Kermit
sang on the preschoolers' ``Sesame Street,'' but concluded that
many nice things are green.
   Henson was tall, lean, bearded, with an unruly mane of graying
brown hair and a scholar's slouch. The loudest thing about him were
his sports coats.
   He always seemed a bit uncomfortable in front of the cameras.
Exposed to this world, he would patiently explain the logic of his,
where fluffy, furry, feathered critters had quirks and qualms like
our own.
   On ``Sesame Street,'' Kermit would interview three little pigs
about construction techniques; he'd cover the cow that jumped over
the moon as if it were a NASA space shot.
   As emcee of the syndicated ``Muppet Show,'' Kermit brought
dignity (and intense frustration) to the impossible task of
mounting a variety show with dozens of Muppets and one live human,
like Liza Minnelli or Paul Simon.
   There was no joke too ancient, no sight gag too skewed, no pun
too awful that Henson and his collaborators could not dust it off
and trot it out, usually with an elegant variation, for ``The
Muppet Show.''
   In one inspired bit, singer Della Reese sits in her dressing
room surrounded by clattering shellfish. Don't ask why. ``Oh, clam
up!'' she snaps. In another scene, Muppets horrifically collide on
a ski slope to the ambling strains of ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds.''
   Through it all, Kermit would cope, or try to, where others would
give up. And Henson, even while presiding over a multimillion
dollar Muppet empire, stayed with the frog.
   Like others of his generation, Henson's first exposure to
puppets was Burr Tillstrom's TV show ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie,''
featuring hand puppets Kukla the clown and Oliver J. Dragon with
their human friend Fran Allison.
   Henson saw that television and Muppets were made for each other.
The little screen might turn humans into one-dimensional talking
heads, but Muppets literally could fill the screen with action _
top, bottom and sides.
   Henson also took his puppets out of the traditional Punch and
Judy proscenium, using sophisticated materials and technology to
create them and put them through their paces. And what wonderful
characters:
   _ Big Bird, a whopping, yellow bird on ``Sesame Street'' with
the same cares and questions about the world as any 5-year-old. If
a bird that big can have questions about things, maybe it's OK for
a small person to wonder as well.
   _ Cookie Monster, blue and shaggy with quivering, crazy eyes,
could devour non-food substances with impunity, but would lapse
into hoarsely bellowing ``Cookie? Cookie? Cookie!'' at the prospect
of eating one.
   _ Miss Piggy, a prima donna whose blond tresses, blue eyes and
snout have graced pinup calendars, famed for her shrill battle cry
and karate blows and her not-so-secret passion for Kermit _ who, of
course, wanted nothing to do with her. Frog meets pig, frog loses
pig ...
   _ Fozzie Bear, a perennially flop-sweated comedian who can't get
a chuckle from a crowd with a tankful of laughing gas.
   _ Gonzo, a beakey creature whose passion is ... chickens.
   _ Rowlf, the gravel-voiced dog whose barrelhouse piano stylings
showed off a strong left paw.
   And so on.
   Henson went into a class by himself when he moved his creations
beyond television, putting the Muppets into three feature films,
beginning with ``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979.
   In 1982, Henson directed ``The Dark Crystal,'' a fantasy
adventure set in a never-world with no human characters. He
followed its success with ``Labyrinth,'' another fantasy feature,
in 1985.
   Henson's Creature Workshop also designed the figures of the
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' movie. Ultimately, Henson used
computers, hydraulics, radio controls and other electronic hardware
to make his puppets more lifelike.
   Henson lived his adult life doing exactly what he loved, and his
work showed it. As the theme song of ``The Muppet Movie'' concluded
about pursuing one's dreams, ``everyone needs a rainbow connection,
the lover, the dreamer and me.''
