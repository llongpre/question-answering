   The death of Jim Henson, whose warm and fuzzy
Muppets like Kermit the Frog taught and delighted millions
worldwide, shocked those who appreciated his art, but they said
they're glad his work will live on.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera singer
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death at age 53 Wednesday of
complications from pneumonia.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. Kermit and some of his pals
made their debut on a Washington TV program, ``Sam and Friends,''
which won an Emmy in 1959. During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe
appeared regularly on ``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.''
   But the Muppets' popularity exploded into a worldwide phenomenon
after they began appearing on ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman and chief executive officer
of Children's Television Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend. Fortunately for the children of the world, Jim
Henson's work will live on.''
   Opera singer Placido Domingo, actor Danny DeVito and singer Lena
Horne were among the real-life stars who performed with the Muppets.
   Miss Horne said Henson was absent Tuesday from a gathering of
the ``Sesame Street'' cast and friends. But she had no idea he was
near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' said Miss Horne.
   In 1976, Henson introduced ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred
the Mae West-style femme fatale Miss Piggy. The show won three
Emmys during its five-year run and became the most widely seen TV
program in the world. Some 235 million viewers in 100 countries
watched it.
   The Muppets, in dark and macabre form, also appeared in the
first year of ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1975.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' in 1981 and
``The Muppets Take Manhattan'' in 1984.
   His magic touch was evident again this year with his work on the
box-office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Henson, a rumpled figure with shaggy hair and a beard, said the
word ``muppet'' was something he just made up, although to appease
interviewers he would say it was a combination of ``marionette''
and ``puppet.'' Besides Kermit, he did the voices of Ernie and
game-show host Guy Smiley.
   ``Puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon
characters have,'' Henson said in 1986. ``I'm sure Kermit will stay
younger a lot longer than I will.''
   Henson's death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street'' in the
past year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the popular
children's series, died last year at age 52. Former cast member
Northern Calloway also died recently.
   A ``Sesame Street'' spokeswoman said it was too soon to say how
Henson's passing would affect the show.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at New York Hospital,
was asked by a reporter if Henson had AIDS. He said: ``He had
pneumonia, definitely, absolutely, no AIDS.''
   Henson had been admitted to the hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' untreated for at least three days, Gelmont
said.
   Asked why Henson failed to seek more aggressive treatment for
his illness, Jim Henson Productions spokeswoman Susan Berry said:
``My guess is he's totally absorbed. He couldn't be bothered. He
was very cavalier with his health.''
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., in 1936. He married in
1959 and with his wife, Jane, had five children. They range in age
from 19 to 30.
   He directed the fantasy films ``The Dark Crystal'' in 1982 and
``Labyrinth'' in 1986.
   Henson won a Peabody award for excellence in TV programming, a
Grammy for a Muppet album, and four consecutive Emmys for
outstanding animation for his Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies.''
