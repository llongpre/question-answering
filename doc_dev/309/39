Before Muppet master Jim Henson died on May 16, he saw footage of "Jim Henson's 
Mother Goose Stories," which premieres Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on the Disney 
Channel. The 13-part series, produced by Henson's production company, marks the 
directorial debut of Henson's 26-year-old son, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
"He got to see most of them," Henson said softly. "He loved them. They're real 
sweet. I think they are wonderful for the preschool audience for whom they are 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a household populated by Kermit and the other Muppets, Henson 
said, "I thought puppetry was a much bigger thing that everybody knew about." 
His father's forte was glove puppets but Brian Henson was drawn to marionettes. 
"I loved the work of Bill Baird's Marionettes," he said. "We used to go to see 
his shows in New York City." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henson was only peripherally involved with "Jim Henson's Mother Goose 
Stories," even though it bares his name (the series features Jim Henson 
Productions' puppets). 
</P>
<P>
The series is based on "Mother Goose in Prose," written by "The Wizard of Oz" 
creator L. Frank Baum. It's a fanciful look at the stories behind the beloved 
rhymes, with Mother Goose introducing the tales to her three goslings. The 
puppets, which interact with human performers, are designed after Maxfield 
Parrish's illustrations in the Baum book. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour episodes consist of three stories featuring such characters as 
Peter Pumpkin Eater, Queen of Hearts, Miss Muffet, Humpty Dumpty and Bo Peep. 
Miss Muffet, for example, is a city girl who wants to go to the country, so she 
runs away. "While out in the country," Henson said, "she meets a farmer and he 
gives her curds and whey. She ends up on the tuffet and then the spider comes 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Each story was produced in one day. "We were shooting quite quickly," Henson 
said. "We were trying to get through three sets for every show. The show is a 
mixture of illustrations and real sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson first began working with his father on the film "The Great Muppet 
Caper." His marionette expertise is on view in the scene where Kermit and Miss 
Piggy bike around a London park. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a complicated marionette effect," he said. "It was a marionette 
from a crane. We had a rig hanging from a crane and the crane was rolling along 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Henson did the marionette work in "The Muppets Take 
Manhattan" in the scene where rats cook food in a diner. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started being the puppeteer who worked out complicated effects, which 
brought me to more complicated characters," Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
He performed the puppetry for the role of Jack Pumpkinhead in "The Return to 
Oz" and for the reindeer Donner in "Santa Claus: The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Henson was one of 30 people who animated the plant Audrey II in "The Little 
Shop of Horrors." Four four months, he and his fellow puppeteers rehearsed 
every scene in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
"We would work on a scene for three weeks," he said. "When you have all of 
those people and a really dexterous puppet like Audrey, it's great fun. The 
character can do so much." 
</P>
<P>
In charge of the performance department at the Henson Creature Shop in London, 
Henson has worked with designers to create puppets that require fewer 
puppeteers. "Now we use a lot of computers with a control device so a puppeteer 
can control a lot more," he said. The dog in Jim Henson's short-lived NBC 
series "The Storyteller" was the prototype. "The dog is a hand puppet, but on 
my left hand is a complicated hand control," said Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Before "Mother Goose," Henson had done second-unit directing on several 
projects including "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." "It takes a lot of 
preproduction (directing) puppets," he said. "You have to work out the blocking 
and where the characters are going to be. The idea is to imagine the best 
action you would want, how you would want it to play, and then you design the 
sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson has put his puppet and directing duties on the back burner since his 
father's death. "I have been very involved in the company a long time," he said 
somberly. "I am taking on an executive position; my job has changed. But it's 
too difficult to define it right now."
