   Abe Lincoln, the robot, beat Kermit the
frog in a quiet civil war at Disneyland.
   Disneyland will keep the ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln''
show, which park officials had planned to close this weekend. No
longer would the nation's 16th president rise from his chair, 51
times a day, to deliver excerpts from his speeches.
   Park operators reportedly planned to replace the show with a new
Muppets attraction.
   But tourists and park employees were irked by the idea and
Disneyland officials apparently backed off from their plans _ for
now.
   ``If you'd asked a few days ago, I'd have said that being a
25-year-old attraction, its popularity has passed,'' said park
spokesman Paul Goldman. ``But there seems to be a lot of sentiment
for Lincoln.''
   For one park visitor, 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand
Forks, Minn., Kermit just can't compare to Honest Abe.
   ``Lincoln was president. Kermit is a frog,'' she said.
   Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures but
acknowledge that park visitors recently haven't shown a lot of
interest in the Lincoln show.
   Reports had circulated for months among Disneyland's 8,000
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which houses the Lincoln
show and exhibits honoring park founder Walt Disney, would be
turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Last week, officials said the Lincoln exhibit would be closed on
Sunday for the ``refurbishing'' of the opera house.
   But Goldman said Thursday park planners were looking at several
other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the ``It's a
Small World'' attraction.
   ``It's a matter of shoe-horning things in,'' he said.
   Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters
last year and plans to use Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird and the
gang in shows and parades at the park.
