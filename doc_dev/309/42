   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $27.7
billion in the second quarter, the best showing in more than four
years, as a record level of exports overcame a big surge in the
nation's foreign oil bill, the government says.
   The Commerce Department said Monday the 2.3 percent drop in the
trade deficit during the April-June period marked the second
consecutive quarterly decline. But economists warned that the
deficit may be growing again in the second half of the year.

intent, the Wall Street Journal reported in Monday's editions. A
Texas Air spokesman declined comment. Department of Transportation
rules prevent foreign companies from holding more than a 25 percent
stake in a U.S. airline.

   Japanese prime ministers customarily visit Washington shortly
after taking office to establish good working relations, but Kaifu
also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic
credentials and revitalize his government's foreign policy, the

   Agricultural groups debated with federal
regulators and with each other about whether the Chicago Board of
Trade should have ordered the emergency liquidation of July soybean
futures contracts.
   ``It's becoming more and more evident that the cost of this
liquidation was all put on the back of the producers,'' John White
Jr. of the American Farm Bureau Federation said Monday.
   The Board of Trade's emergency liquidation order last month was
aimed at breaking up a suspected attempt to corner the market by
Italy's Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA.

   A federal judge has ruled that a shareholder
lawsuit against Sundstrand Corp. can be brought to trial, reversing

agreed to pay a $115 million fine. The judge's latest ruling was
announced Monday.
