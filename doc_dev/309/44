<LEADPARA>  EARL Sinclair, the leading character in ABC's newest sitcom, couldn't be in a
better mood. Today is "Hurling Day," the day he legally can throw his
mother-in-law off a cliff to her death.;    Wait a minute! How low can a
network sink? They wouldn't even do something like that on "Married . . . with
Children." Can this be the disgusting new direction for TV comedy in the 1990s?  </LEADPARA>

'DINOSAURS' IS A HARD-EDGED SITCOM FOR ADULTS
-- AND THE REALIZATION OF JIM HENSON'S LAST
DREAM  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  (box) 'Dinosaurs' reviewed, Page 4G  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Maybe so. But it's not quite what it seems. You see, Earl and his
mother-in-law aren't humans. They're dinosaurs. And everybody knows it's
traditional in dinosaur families to toss the old folks off a cliff into a tar
pit as soon as they reach age 72. It makes sense, too. Those old dinosaurs
slow down the pack and attract predators. So don't judge them by our
standards.;    Earl and his family are the principal characters of ABC's
"Dinosaurs," which premieres Friday night at 8:30 (Chs. 7, 11, 13) after the
greatest network ballyhoo campaign since "Batman" made its debut in 1966.;   
In a word, it's radical. Stranger yet, it originally sprang from the fertile
mind of the late Jim Henson, the gentle creator of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy
and all the other Muppets.;    Just before he died last May, Henson had begun
to flesh out details of a wacky concept he'd been carrying around in his head
for several years: a live-action TV situation comedy starring a family of
dinosaurs whose wasteful, contemporary lifestyle obviously was going to lead
to their eventual extinction as a species.;    It was a daring idea for
Henson, whose career had been built upon wholesome, genial programs for
children. This one would be hard-edged and hip, primarily aimed at adults.;   
And because the dinosaurs would be "played" by life-size, "animatronic"
puppets, it would be awesomely expensive.;    At first, Henson's death from
pneumonia at age 53 seemed to doom this boldest of ideas. Yet, despite heavy
odds, Henson's last great dream has survived to fool the doomsayers, rising up
out of the primordial ooze of failed partnerships, lawsuits, creative
roadblocks and budget overruns.;    "We've been very faithful to his original
idea," said Brian Henson, 27-year-old heir to the Henson legacy, in a
telephone interview this week from the "Dinosaurs" set. "We've all felt
pressure because we wanted to do a project Jim would be proud of if he were
with us today.";    It hasn't been easy. Still grieving over his father's
death, young Henson suddenly found himself in the middle of a chaotic
situation last summer.;    First, the nearly complete multimillion-dollar
merger of Jim Henson Productions with the Walt Disney Co. suddenly fell apart.
Yet the two companies still had a commitment from ABC for "Dinosaurs," a
co-production that Disney would finance.;    But there was skepticism that
young Henson would be able to supply the creative leadership for his father's
company and fulfill its commitments. Amid hard feelings over the failed
merger, legal squabbling began over Disney's use of Henson characters at
Disney theme parks. Tension heightened.;    But Jim Henson's colleagues
rallied around Brian, who had worked with them since he was 17, learning his
dad's business from the ground up. He was elected company president and vowed
to go on with "Dinosaurs.";    "It was a scary task at first," said Henson. "I
was pretty fresh to the business end of it. But we all sat down together and
figured out what to do." Though the Henson Co. finally filed suit against
Disney earlier this month, Henson and his creative partners on "Dinosaurs,"
including Disney's own hand-picked executives, have proceeded without rancor,
even when costs on the first episode alone soared to a rumored $5 million.;   
At stake is a show almost everyone involved believes will be an enormous
runaway hit, maybe even bigger than "The Simpsons" -- with the promise of tens
of millions of dollars in merchandising and other ancillary profits to come.; 
  A couple of young pros;    Most observers believe "Dinosaurs" survived all
the initial roadblocks because of the strict professionalism of young Henson,
who is executive producer, and Michael Jacobs, his chief creative partner and
co-executive producer, whom Disney put in place.;    "Brian is about the most
gentle soul I've ever met," said Jacobs in his office at CBS/MTM studios,
where "Dinosaurs" occupies an entire soundstage. "That's infuriating, because
I'm a more obnoxious type. I can't seem to make him lose his temper, though
God knows I'm trying.";    Henson holds Jacobs in equally high regard. Jacobs,
the still-youthful producer of such network shows as "My Two Dads" and
"Charles in Charge," runs the "idea team," while Henson heads the group that
has to turn those ideas into filmable reality. Their worlds occasionally
collide, but Henson says the input they get from each other is what makes it
"such a unique, fun project.";    Once the decision was firm to go on, both
men sat down with their lieutenants and producer Kirk Thatcher, who had
sketched out some of Jim Henson's original ideas about a month before Henson's
death. Jacobs developed Henson's ideas into the fully realized "Dinosaurs"
concept; Thatcher put them on paper; and Brian Henson's team built them in
their London "creature lab.";    Jacobs' notion was to rewrite prehistory by
adding a new geologic era to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. In this
brief era, Jacobs reasoned, the dinosaurs developed domestic family life,
started tearing down forests to build condos and generally despoiled their
environment like Boobus Americanus, circa 1991.;    "This period also
coincided with the arrival of the caveman," Jacobs explained. "We're probably
only inaccurate by 150 million or so years.";    That little twist on dinosaur
lore is fully in keeping with Jim Henson's original premise, which suggested
dinosaurs made themselves extinct by behaving too much like humans do today.; 
  "It's a very subtle, underlying message," said Brian, "but it makes such a
wonderful parallel to our own lifestyle.";    Jacobs, who still rises early
each day to watch Henson's Muppets on "Sesame Street" with his two youngsters,
has run rampant with the concept, delighting in the chance to see our world
through the eyes of another species.;    In one episode, for instance, the
show will make fun of the teen "coming of age" formula by having 12-year-old
Charlene Sinclair fretting over the fact her tail isn't developing like those
of the other girls in class.;    "Naturally, she feels inadequate because the
males all gravitate to the girls with bigger, rounder tails," said Jacobs.;   
They'll also have fun with "species" prejudice among dinosaurs. Earl and his
family are carnivorous; so they don't get along so well with the herbivores.
If "Dinosaurs" gets picked up for next season, Jacobs is toying with having a
brontosaur family move in next door.;    "It'll be sort of like the Jeffersons
moving in next to Archie Bunker," he said.;    While such ideas flowed, Henson
and his experts were battling budgets and racing the clock to make them
happen. Each character is 7 to 9 feet tall and must be meticulously engineered
to look lifelike while being operated off camera by various mechanical and
electronic means.;    "What's important is to keep coming up with something
new and innovative that looks like nothing you've seen before," said Henson.; 
  A film veteran;  The 27-year-old is experienced well beyond his years. He
supervised the team that operated Audrey, the carnivorous plant in "Little
Shop of Horrors," and was both chief puppeteer and second unit director on
last year's movie megahit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.";    Still, he
realizes he's now the chief standard-bearer of a monumental legacy and will be
severely judged, fairly or not, for the quality of "Dinosaurs." He concedes he
has placed himself under a great deal of emotional pressure on that score.;   
"Protecting my father's legacy is of the utmost importance to me now," he
said.;    ABC is giving "Dinosaurs" 13 episodes to become a hit and earn a
spot on the fall lineup. With such overwhelming expense involved, nobody
expects ABC to be satisfied with piddling ratings success.;    "We're either
going to hit it out of the park or swing so hard that we wind up face-first in
the dirt," said Jacobs. "Sometimes I sit down on the set, hold my head in my
hands and ask what I've gotten myself into." With its high cliffs and tar pits
handy, the "Dinosaurs" set might even be the ideal place for a TV producer to
read the weekly ratings reports and contemplate his future.  </TEXT>
