<LEADPARA>  IN THE early days of television, Hollywood studios saw the new medium as
potentially awesome competition and refused to permit any cross-pollination.
But visionaries such as Walt Disney quickly saw TV as the next gold mine.;  
Disney plunged into it in 1954, primarily to promote his risky new theme park,
Disneyland. The first major studio to follow suit was Warner Bros., which went
on the air in 1955 with its "Warner Bros. Presents" anthology and soon was
grinding out TV hits, such as "Maverick."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Disney also was the first movie mogul to meet with success putting TV
concepts into movie theaters. When his "Davy Crockett" TV stories with Fess
Parker became a national kiddie phenomenon, Disney edited some episodes
together and booked them into theaters as feature films. The first, "Davy
Crockett -- King of the Wild Frontier," was one of the biggest box-office hits
of 1955.;   (For the record, some others beat Disney to the idea, but without
his enormous success. Some examples: the original pilot for the "Superman" TV
series with George Reeves, which first went to theaters in 1951 as the movie
"Superman and the Mole Men"; and "Pier 23," an unsold pilot for a private-eye
series starring Hugh "Ward Cleaver" Beaumont, also released as a 1951 movie.);
  Warner Bros. jumped on the idea after Disney's success, doing feature-film
versions of several popular TV shows, including "Dragnet" (1954), "Our Miss
Brooks" (1956), "The Lone Ranger" (1956) and "The Lone Ranger and the Lost
City of Gold" (1958), all with the TV casts.;   Feature-film versions of TV
shows became a familiar genre from then on, as studios sought to cash in on
the usually short-term popularity of a hit TV series. Among the many were
"Foreign Intrigue" (1956), "The Lineup" (1958), "McHale's Navy" (1964) and its
sequel, "McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force" (1965), "Munster, Go Home" (1966),
the Adam West/Burt Ward "Batman" (1966), Paramount's "Gunn" (1967), an update
of "Peter Gunn" with Craig Stevens and "The Nude Bomb" (1980), with Don Adams
reprising his Maxwell Smart character from TV's "Get Smart!";   Virtually no
TV genre was overlooked. Dan Curtis turned his "Dark Shadows" daytime soap
into two movies, "House of Dark Shadows" (1970) and "Night of Dark Shadows"
(1971). Jim Henson took his Muppets to the big screen with "The Muppet Movie,"
a 1979 hit, and returned with a 1984 sequel, "The Muppets Take Manhattan." Big
Bird even called on theaters in 1985's "Sesame Street Presents Follow That
Bird.";   George Romero's syndicated horror anthologies became "Tales From the
Darkside: The Movie" (1990). Chuck Barris managed to turn a game show into a
feature film: "The Gong Show Movie" (1980). There was also a peep-show version
of Allen Funt's "Candid Camera" called "What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?"
(1970), and "Wanted: Dead or Alive" (1987) was an action picture starring
Rutger Hauer as the grandson of Steve McQueen's bounty-hunter character from
the TV western series of the same name. (box)  </TEXT>
