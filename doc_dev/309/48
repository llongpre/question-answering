After perusing the Judy Jetson cosmetic kits and Fred Flintstone bolo ties, Pat 
Hockings found just what she wanted: a $2 refrigerator magnet with the likeness 
of her Space Age cartoon hero, George Jetson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a Jetsons and a Flintstones fan," said Hockings after 
shopping at a Torrance gift shop owned and named after Hanna-Barbera, the 
Hollywood animation studio whose cartoon characters populate the store. "There 
is nothing in there you really need. You just go into the store for the fun of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
George Jetson has joined Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse in the mall in the 
most recent effort by Hollywood studios to exploit the popularity of their 
well-known film and television characters. The market for such shops, however, 
is limited by the small number of entertainment firms with a stable of 
characters that have broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not expect this to be a trend that can be duplicated by everyone," 
said Sarah A. Stack, a retail industry analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards. "I think very few cartoon or character franchises have the impact of 
Disney." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Walt Disney Co. and Hanna-Barbera have opened up company-owned stores. 
Jim Henson Productions, which has agreed to be purchased by Disney, has a 
licensing agreement with a Toronto-based chain of stores called Muppet Stuff. 
Meanwhile, the Children's Television Workshop agreed to let a California toy 
store and children's apparel chain use the name and characters of its popular 
"Sesame Street" program. 
</P>
<P>
In a growing mail-order operation, Time Warner Inc. hawks Bugs Bunny jelly 
beans and "Murphy Brown" coffee mugs and shirts through its Warner Bros. 
Collection catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood studios have long derived profits from licensing the likenesses and 
names of their characters for use on everything from T-shirts to Yogi Bear's 
Jellystone Park Camp-Resorts camp grounds. The new stores lend the studios and 
their productions greater exposure and can serve as an important marketing tool 
if managed well, say industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
And in tough economic times, the name of a well-known and trusted entertainment 
program or character goes a long way in setting a new retailer apart from 
competitors. "It's the integrity" of the name that is valuable, said Gene 
Platin, who heads the four-store Sesame Street General Store chain. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise of these stores meshes with retailing and demographic trends. 
"We have noticed is a big surge in children's toys, children's clothes, family 
oriented gift items and just fun types of things," said Iris Callie, vice 
president of leasing for Westfield Inc. Westfield operates the Westside 
Pavilion, where Hanna-Barbera opened its first mall store in July. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. launched the trend three years ago when it opened the first 
Disney store in Glendale. The chain, which helps promote recent Disney film 
productions, has grown to nearly 80 stores, including its first international 
outlet on London's fashionable Regent Street. 
</P>
<P>
Disney spokesman Chuck Champlin said the company is "very pleased with the 
operation," which will grow to more than 100 stores next year. "We don't see 
any decrease in the popularity, and we get many repeat visitors in each 
stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The stores also give Disney more power to control and manage the carefully 
cultivated image it has created for its characters. "You could argue that many 
of the Disney characters are brands . . . and as long as they continue to 
cultivate the core images of those brands they can do no wrong," said Robert 
Kahn, executive director of corporate image consultants Landor Associates in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Television Workshop also scrutinizes the operations of the 
Sesame Street General Store chain, said Platin. "Every product that does not 
carry the Sesame Street name they have to approve. Our buyers cannot just go 
out and buy a crayon set. They have to send it to New York (where the workshop 
is based) to get approval" first. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hanna-Barbera, whose productions have often dominated 
Saturday morning childrens' television programs, joined the fray by opening a 
store at the Universal Studios Tour in Florida and then in malls in West Los 
Angeles and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our classic characters are going to be very important," said Sandra Gilbert, 
vice president of Hanna-Barbera's retail operations. "But it's the new 
characters and the new shows that will add freshness to the stores." 
</P>
<P>
The stores, decorated in the vivid colors used in the Flintstones and Jetsons 
television cartoons, are geared to attract and entertain kids and their parents 
with a mix of gifts, toys and apparel. At the back of the stores, a space-age 
console out of a Jetsons cartoon lets kids view Hanna-Barbera cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming at nostalgic parents and children is a strategy that seems to have paid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Cartoons never burn out -- I still watch the Flintstones," said Kris Dykes of 
Torrance, who picked up a Scooby-Doo whistle at the Hanna-Barbera store in the 
Del Amo Fashion Center. "I have a kid, and every time we walk by the store she 
goes inside." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said there is enough room in the retailing world for Hanna-Barbera and 
Disney stores to grow. At the Del Amo Fashion Center, Disney officials say 
business has actually increased since a Hanna-Barbera store opened in the same 
mall in September and several shoppers say the patronize both stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to the Disney store all the time," said Jennifer Peterson, a San Pedro 
resident who had just finished strolling through the Hanna-Barbera store with 
her two infant daughters. "I like it, and there is something for kids to do," 
she said of the store. 
</P>
<P>
But the Del Amo Fashion Center, the largest shopping mall in Southern 
California, may be the exception in housing both a Disney and a Hanna-Barbera 
store. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not see a need to have both a Disney store and a Hanna-Barbera," said 
Callie at the Westside Pavilion, which also houses a small Muppet Stuff store. 
"With a Hanna-Barbera store, there is no need for a Disney store."
