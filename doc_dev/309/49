<LEADPARA>  A routine financial audit at Walt Disney Co. turned up a real eye-opener
recently. More than $80,000 a week, or $4 million a year, was being spent on
private messenger services.;    Other entertainment companies might have
written it off as one of the costs of doing business in Hollywood, where
extravagance tends to be flaunted. But the frugal-minded Disney summarily
dispatched the messengers to the unhappiest place on Earth, the unemployment
line.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Calls for austerity can be heard throughout the Magic Kingdom as the
Burbank-based company struggles to recover from its worst quarter in six
years. Disney, which wrote the book on entertainment management in the
freewheeling 1980s, is examining everything from projection room costs to
employee efficiency in its effort to adjust to the recessionary '90s.;    The
Persian Gulf war and economic problems have cut deeply into theme park
profits. Box-office receipts were in a downward spiral until last weekend,
when "What About Bob?" took in a morale-boosting $9.2 million. The company's
wholesome image has even been battered in recent court cases that improbably
pitted Disney against the Muppets and a disabled Peggy Lee.;    Most financial
analysts remain high on Disney, which was recently added to the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks. But the prevailing wisdom says it
is unlikely that the company can sustain the phenomenal growth it enjoyed when
Chairman Michael D. Eisner and his management team increased earnings from $98
million to $824 million between 1984 and 1990.;    Disney's profit margin
slipped more than a point, to 14.1 percent, last year. The company still
outperforms its competitors in most areas, but Disney's legendary corporate
arrogance has lost a bit of its edge.;    Company executives readily
acknowledge their mistake in allowing disputes with singer Lee and the
creators of the Muppets to reach the courts.;    "When it comes to the
hardball issue, we are guilty and we know it," said one executive. "We also
know that we better change it. It's been win-win for us for a long time. But
it's time we introduced some compassion and sensitivity into the process.";   
Disney's California and Florida theme parks, which accounted for $3 billion of
the company's $5.8 billion in revenue last year, took the biggest hit in its
most recent financial reporting period. Operating income from the parks
dropped 33 percent in the second quarter of this fiscal year, compared to the
previous year's quarter. Overall earnings were down 29 percent, while revenue
rose 10 percent.;    The war, the recession, high airline costs and growing
competition have contributed to a slowdown that may not be over, financial
analysts say. "It is difficult to see how this dominant segment of the company
will grow at anything more than 8 percent to 10 percent annually," even with
the 1992 opening of the Euro Disney park near Paris, Merrill Lynch analyst
Harold Vogel wrote in a recent report.;    Disney is counting on Henson's
Muppets to boost attendance at Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park in Florida.
Patriotism's drawing power will also be tested. Red, white and blue are the
prevailing colors this summer as Disney World features "America: The Musical,"
a salute to the armed forces.  </TEXT>
