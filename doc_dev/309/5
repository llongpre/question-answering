<LEADPARA>  A bitter custody fight over Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and other creative
offspring of the late Jim Henson has erupted between the Muppet creator's
natural heirs and Walt Disney Co.;    Claiming that they are trying to prevent
the "outright theft of Jim Henson's legacy," a pair of companies controlled by
Henson's heirs filed suit Wednesday to stop Burbank-based Disney from using
the Muppets at theme parks without a license.  </LEADPARA>

HENSON HEIRS CHARGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The U.S. District Court suit followed the breakdown of merger negotiations
between Henson's heirs and Disney in December and the collapse of licensing
talks between them Tuesday night.;    Disney had signed a letter of intent
with Jim Henson to acquire Henson Associates and rights to such characters as
Kermit and Miss Piggy in August 1989. But the $150 million deal foundered
after Henson died last May.;    "Even though Disney walked away from its offer
to buy our company, it is acting as if it owns the Muppets," said Brian
Henson, president of Henson Associates and one of Jim Henson's five children.;
   In its suit, Henson Associates said that Disney had used the Muppets in
promotional materials and a live stage show, and it claimed that Disney
planned to open an attraction called "Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision
3-D" at Walt Disney World on May 4.;    "It's ironic that Disney, of all
people, should be named in a suit like this," said Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
entertainment industry analyst Christopher P. Dixon, noting that Disney is
famous for going to great lengths to protect its own stable of characters. "It
looks like Disney is being hoist on its own petard.";    Disney files about
200 lawsuits and regulatory actions a year against alleged violators of its
own copyrights and trademarks. The company once threatened to sue a day-care
center with paintings of Disney characters on its walls.;    Disney, in a
statement, called the Henson charges "outrageous" and "an enormous
distortion.";    Erwin Okun, Disney's senior vice president, argued that the
close working relationship between Henson Associates and Disney, which
continued after Henson's death, had created "an implied license" to use the
characters.;    Okun acknowledged that Disney has used the Muppets in a stage
show and on some merchandise but said the opening date for the 3-D attraction
"is yet to be determined." He said Disney had invested $90 million to build
Muppet-related attractions and facilities.;    The suit alleges that Disney
sought to interfere with the relationship between Henson interests and
Children's Television Workshop, the non-profit corporation that produces
"Sesame Street" and has exclusive rights to such Henson-created characters as
Big Bird and Cookie Monster.;    Okun, denouncing the lawsuit's charges as
"scurrilous" and "fantasy," said: "There are tears in Mickey's eyes today."  </TEXT>
