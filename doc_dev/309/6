   Walt Disney Co. and Jim Henson Productions
broke off talks Thursday after failing to reach an agreement on
Disney's plans to acquire rights to Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and
the other Muppet characters.
   The proposed deal to acquire Henson Associates Inc. was valued
at $100 million to $150 million. Disney also had sought an
exclusive production agreement with Jim Henson Productions in the
talks, which began in August 1989.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney Chairman
and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner said in a statement.
   Erwin Okun, a senior Disney vice president, said it was too
early to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude Disney
and Henson Productions from launching future joint productions.
However, he noted that statements issued by both companies were
cordial.
   ``We have great admiration for Jim and respect for the Henson
people, the family, who we've gotten to know pretty well,'' Okun
said.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Productions since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose,'' a situation comedy series involving
dinosaurs, which is scheduled to air in January on ABC, and a 3-D
film that will be shown to visitors to Walt Disney World in
Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a news release. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could ot reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, who died May 18, founded his production company in 1958
as Muppets Inc. to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson death.
   Analysts had speculated that his passing would lessen the value
of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents formed part of
Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet characters such
as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.
   ``There were enormous estate tax problems. From what I have
heard that was a major area that was problematic,'' Logsdon said.
``It gets down to them asking, `What are we really getting as a
return, what kind of money will we be making?.'''
   In losing the deal, Disney lost the opportunity to combine two
sets of highly loved and highly marketable characters, Logsdon
said.
   ``It gave Disney a whole new range of characters to utilize in
their theme parks and entertainment projects,'' Logsdon said.
   Disney reached an agreement in principle with Henson only weeks
after negotiations began last year. The deal called for Henson to
operate a Los Angeles production company under the Disney umbrella.
   Except for Kermit the Frog, Disney was not to receive rights to
Muppet characters that appear regularly on Sesame Street. Those
characters are owned in part by the show's producer, Children's
Television Workshop.
