The Walt Disney Co. today announced that a $1-billion theme park will be built 
in Southern California and unveiled plans for about a dozen new attractions at 
Disneyland that will give the venerable park more of a Hollywood flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The new park will be built either next to Disneyland in Anaheim or near the 
Queen Mary-Spruce Goose attraction -- bought by Disney from the Wrather Corp. 
in 1988 -- in Long Beach, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends a lot on which community wants us more," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney will go to the city that demonstrates the best plan for handling the 
traffic and parking needed for the massive project, Eisner said. He declined to 
release details of the park, saying its theme, size and opening date will 
depend on where it is built. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Disney owns about 66 acres around Disneyland. In Long Beach, the 
company leases 55 acres and holds the option to develop 256 acres of water 
surrounding the Queen Mary attraction. Previously, Disney officials had 
mentioned the idea of a water theme park for this site. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a new park is likely to set off a bidding war between 
Anaheim and Long Beach, two cities that already compete for lucrative 
convention business. Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter was first to the punch today as 
he presented Eisner with a proclamation honoring Disneyland's 35th anniversary 
being celebrated this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I have the first opportunity before Long Beach to say the answer is yes, 
yes, yes," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, some Long Beach officials were given a presentation about the 
possibility of a theme park. Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, 
who represents the downtown area and the Queen Mary site, said Long Beach 
offers a superior infrastructure and transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go as far as we have to go as long as it makes economic sense" to get 
the theme park, Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner also announced plans for a "Disney Decade" that will include the most 
ambitious expansion in Disneyland's history. The expansions will tie the 
Disney's increasingly successful movie operations to the theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, a Dick Tracy stage show at Disneyland will open, timed to 
accompany the release of the company's Dick Tracy movie. In 1991, the Muppets 
will have their own attraction and daily parade and a "Young Indiana Jones" 
stunt show will also open. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the 1990s, two new "lands" will be built: Mickey's Starland, which 
will include the Muppets and an attraction based on the animated film "The 
Little Mermaid," and "Hollywoodland," a reconstruction of Hollywood Boulevard 
as it looked in the 1930s and 1940s, plus two new Roger Rabbit attractions. 
Disneyland's "Tomorrowland" area will also be entirely remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner said an expansion plan for Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., will be 
announced next week.
