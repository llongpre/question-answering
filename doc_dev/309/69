   Ted Turner got some help from Scarlett O'Hara and
Rhett Butler in launching his Turner Network Television.
   Turner welcomed viewers to his new 24-hour television channel
with a brief on-camera appearance at 8 p.m. Monday.
   Next came a rendition of the national anthem _ the same film
clip used to launch Turner's Cable News Network in June 1980 _
followed by ``Gone With The Wind,'' the classic film starring
Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.
   The MGM movie is the cornerstone of Turner's collection of
movies, which will be used for much of the programming on TNT.
   Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock'' show moves
from Home Box Office to TNT today. ``The Muppet Show,'' with Miss
Piggy and Kermit the Frog, was scheduled for this afternoon.
   Turner has said TNT will feature a hybrid of cable and network
programming, and initially will make liberal use of cartoons in the
daytime and movies at night.
   Turner, who also owns Cable News Network, CNN Headline News and
WTBS SuperStation, has scheduled made-for-TNT movies starring
Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett, Charlton
Heston and Faye Dunaway.
