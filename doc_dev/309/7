THE planned marriage between the creators of Miss Piggy and Mickey Mouse
ended in the law courts yesterday when Henson Associates, a family-run
company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit against Walt Disney,
accusing Disney of knowingly violating copyrights and trademarks of the
Muppets.
The relationship between Disney and Henson dates to 1989, when the Hollywood
studio tentatively agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the rights
to some of Henson's most popular characters, including Miss Piggy and Kermit
the Frog, in a deal valued at Dollars 150m. But the arrangement started to
fall apart after Jim Henson's untimely death last year, thoughnegotiations
for a licensing agreement covering a Muppet movie due to open on May 4 and a
Muppet stage show continued until this month.
According to Henson, the negotiations failed because Disney insisted on
exclusive control of all Muppet characters in the two productions in order
to further its domination of the theme park market.
Disney, said yesterday the suit represented 'an enormous distortion of the
facts.' It said 'each Disney concession was met by another Henson demand
until finally it became impossible and the negotiations to acquire the
Henson company ended.'.
