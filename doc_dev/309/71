   Turner Network Television, a hybrid of cable and
network programming, hits the airwaves today in a broadcasting
venture that will serve as a vehicle for Atlanta media magnate Ted
Turner's collection of classic movies.
   Viewers who tune in for TNT's debut will see Vivien Leigh as
Scarlett O'Hara in ``Gone With The Wind,'' the MGM classic which is
the cornerstone of Turner's collection.
   Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock'' show moves
from Home Box Office to TNT Tuesday. ``The Muppet Show,'' with Miss
Piggy and Kermit the Frog, will follow that afternoon and Henson
has signed on for other projects.
   The 24-hour network will initially make liberal use of cartoons
in the daytime and movies at night, but Turner promises one major
project a week by 1991. Already scheduled are made-for-TNT movies
starring Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett and
Oscar-winners Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway.
   Turner, owner of Cable News Network and CNN Headline News, also
promises to bid on major award shows, sporting events including the
Olympics and major league baseball, and other showcase programs.
   Turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get TNT
initially. TNT spokeswoman Allison Berry said early projections had
TNT in 30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990, but the
increase in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989.
   ``It's far less important what they launch with than how quickly
they get into 30 million homes,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst
with Kagan and Associates in Carmel, Calif.
   ``I think they need to reach 30 million within ... 18 to 24
months to keep to their business plan, and actually they'd like to
do it sooner than that.''
   The network said it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for the
first three years into original programming, and Turner himself
told cable company executives in Atlanta for a trade show that the
network would lose $40 million before breaking even.
   ``If we didn't have the MGM library, and the RKO and Warner
libraries, we never could have started the networks, and that was a
billion and a half dollar investment,'' Turner said.
   Turner acquired more than 3,000 films when he purchased MGM-UA
Entertainment Co., then sold all but the films to pay for the
transaction.
   The deal left Turner saddled with $1.4 billion of debt, and
raised doubts about whether he could survive. That debt has since
been refinanced, and large cable companies have bought interest in
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., gaining seats on the board of
directors and say-so over large financial decisions.
   One of the keys to the success of TNT, is the acceptance by
cable systems, whose limited channel space already is overwhelmed,
according to Gerbrandt
   ``I think the general sense in the industry is that (TNT) is an
idea whose time has come, (but) he's launching it at a time when
channel capacity is not exactly abundant,'' Gerbrandt said.
