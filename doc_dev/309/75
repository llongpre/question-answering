   A fourth theme park, a Soviet
pavilion and seven new hotels will be among major projects to be
built during a decade of rapid expansion at Florida's Disney World,
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner announced.
   The 1990s also will feature the entertainment conglomerate's
venture into time-share vacation units, and it plans to open 29 new
attractions at its three existing Florida parks: the Magic Kingdom,
Epcot Center and Disney-MGM Studios.
   Walt Disney Co. already has plans to open Euro Disneyland near
Paris and to build studio attractions at its Japanese and
California parks during the next few years, among other additions,
Eisner said. On Friday, Disney said it is studying the possibility
of opening another Southern Califoria theme park.
   ``But this is the place where the `Disney Decade' will have the
most impact,'' he said Sunday.
   Eisner would not put a price tag on any of the new projects but
said each ``must give the Walt Disney Co. the required return on
investment.''
   The company's objectives are to grow about 20 percent a year
``and have a return on equity of 20 percent for the next decade ...
so we can stay healthy.''
   Disney expects total attendance at all its parks to approach 100
million visits a year by the end of the century, said company
President Frank Wells. Though Disney does not provide annual
attendance figures, published reports have said that Disney
attractions worldwide drew about 30 million people last year.
   Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said at a
news conference at the newly opened 758-room Swan Hotel that the
company anticipates a strong national economy over the decade but
that some of Disney's plans could be modified if there is a drastic
downturn.
   Otherwise, he said, ``Everything we have announced will
definitely be built.''
   Disney officials would not disclose any details about the fourth
Florida park or say when construction would begin.
   Negotiations with Soviet officials have been taking place for
years, and an agreement on a Soviet pavilion at Epcot Center is
near, Eisner said. Also to be announced soon, he said, are plans
for a Swiss pavilion featuring a Matterhorn ride.
   Most of the focus at the start of the decade will be on new
hotels and expansion of the newest Central Florida park, Disney-MGM
Studios, because ``its overwhelming success caught us off guard.''
   Sixteen new shows will result in doubling the capacity of the
studios' exhibits in the next five years, Eisner said.
   These include the newly opened Star Tours thrill ride, several
shows featuring the Muppets, a Dick Tracy musical revenue based on
a Dick Tracy movie and the revival of the television game show
``Let's Make A Deal.''
   Seven new or completely transformed attractions will be
introduced at the Magic Kingdom and five at Epcot Center, he said.
   The $375 million Swan, formally opened Saturday, is the first of
the hotels being built with entertainment as the main architectural
theme. They will have 5,500 guest rooms in total and are in
addition to two others under construction.
   Eisner said Walt Disney World did not intend to be ``completely
self-contained'' in guest accommodations and activities. ``But
we're not meeting the demand of those who want to stay on-site,''
he said.
   The Swan is part of a convention center complex with a
1,509-room hotel called the Dolphin that is scheduled to open July
4.
   Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino assisted Sunday in
ceremonies at which the first of two 30-ton dolphin statues was
hoisted to the roof of the partially completed hotel.
   Among its other expansion plans, Disney says it will build 500
time-share units near its theme parks. Replying to a question about
the bad reputation many of these developments have acquired, Eisner
said the company believed ``we can do it in an attractive, honest
way.''
   A long-discussed commercial shopping mall is still planned on
property Disney owns in neighboring Osceola County, and Eisner said
details of the project are to be announced within 60 days.
   Disney owns 27,400 acres straddling Orange and Osceola counties.
   A 30-acre ``Disney Boardwalk,'' in the tradition of the Atlantic
City and Coney Island amusement areas, is scheduled to open late
next year.
   There was speculation in the past week that Disney also planned
a zoo or live-animal attraction, but Eisner said there were no such
projects in the works.
