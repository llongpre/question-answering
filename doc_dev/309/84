<LEADPARA>  DESPITE a tourism slump brought on by war and recession, Walt Disney World
theme park raised one-day ticket prices by $2 for adults and $1 for children,
effective Feb. 17.;    The increase comes just 3 1/2 months after the Walt
Disney Co. raised prices at Disneyland in Anaheim to $27.50 for adults from
$25.50 and to $22.50 from $20.50 for children.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Disneyland, however, was forced to offer a discount to Southern California
residents earlier this year, when a weak California tourist season hurt
attendance.;    The price change at Disney World raised one-day adult tickets
to $33 from $31 and tickets for children under 10 to $26 from $25. These
prices do not include Florida's 6 percent sales tax.;    Additionally, Disney
World raised the price on a four-day ticket to $111 from $104 for adults and
to $88 from $83 for children, without tax.;    The five-day super ticket
increased to $145 from $135 for adults and to $116 from $108 for kids, without
tax.;    The four-day ticket provides admission to Disney World's three big
parks -- the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park
-- while the five-day ticket admits visitors to the three parks plus River
Country; Typhoon Lagoon, a water-thrill park; Discovery Island; and Pleasure
Island, a nighttime entertainment complex.;    Also, the cover charge at
Pleasure Island for those without super tickets jumped to $11.95 from $9.94.; 
  The new ticket prices are the 13th across-the-board price increase at Disney
World since Michael Eisner and Frank Wells were hired to head the theme park's
parent company in September 1984, when the price of an adult ticket was $15.; 
  Disney World says it is raising prices because it has added new shows,
including the "Here Come the Muppets" stage show, the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles and the "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" play area, based on the successful
comedy film about an eccentric inventor who "shrinks" his family to insect
size. The attraction is geared to younger children, who can ramble through
30-foot-high blades of "grass" and climb up on a monster "ant.";    Disney
last raised single-day prices on Feb. 11, 1990, and prices for four- and
five-day passes in May 1990.;    By instituting the price increases now,
Disney can take advantage of Florida's peak winter-spring tourist season,
which got under way in mid-February and continues through Easter, March 31.;  
 Bruce Turner, an entertainment analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc.
in Winter Park, Fla., said Disney World's price increases "don't surprise me,
in a way, because they are a monopoly. They wouldn't use that word, but they
do have something no one else has.";    Turner said, though, that Disney's
aggressive price increases could be "a dangerous approach" to boosting
revenue.;    "There is concern in the investment community that Disney may be
pricing itself out of the market," he said.; (hbox);    The "Disney Decade"
will be only a couple of years old when the company's fourth major park opens
next spring at Marne le Valle, about 15 miles east of Paris. Euro Disneyland,
like its cousins in Tokyo, Florida and California, will likely become as big a
tourist attraction in the Old World as the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum and
Trafalgar Square.;    The European venture, budgeted at more than $2 billion,
will encompass 4,800 acres (compared with Orlando's 28,000 acres) and will
feature six new hotels with geographic themes -- New York and Santa Fe are two
-- an entertainment center and, eventually, a park like Orlando's Disney-MGM
Studios Theme Park.;    In the United States, the Disney company has begun
construction in Orlando on another Splash Mountain -- a giant flume ride with
a spectacular water drop that has been packing in crowds in Anaheim for the
past year. Splash Mountain clones are also to be built in Japan and France.;  
 Disney has also increased the options of where to stay at its Florida park.
Two centerpiece resorts, the Walt Disney World Swan and the Walt Disney World
Dolphin, have opened recently. Two more debuts are scheduled, one in June and
one in 1992, to add 3,000 rooms at the theme park. In addition, six resort
projects are on the drawing boards for the Disney Decade, as the corporation
has dubbed the '90s, although their timing will depend on demand.;    For some
time Disney has been discussing opening a second park in Southern California,
either near the existing Disneyland in Anaheim or in Long Beach, where the
Disney company operates the retired ocean liner Queen Mary and, next door, the
Spruce Goose, Howard Hughes' legendary wooden flying boat. A spokesman for
Disney said that plans for the new park are still "in the talking stage."  </TEXT>
