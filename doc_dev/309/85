   Ted Turner, who gave cable TV its first
superstation, launches his latest broadcasting venture Monday night
with the debut of Turner Network Television, the new home of
Scarlett O'Hara and Miss Piggy.
   At first, Turner will build TNT with films from his
billion-dollar film library, led off Monday by ``Gone With The
Wind,'' his favorite movie.
   On Tuesday, Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock''
show moves from Home Box Office to TNT. ``The Muppet Show,'' with
Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, will follow that afternoon and
Henson has signed on for other projects.
   Although early on the 24-hour network will make liberal use of
cartoons in the daytime and movies at night, Turner promises one
major project a week by 1991: already scheduled are made-for-TNT
movies starring Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett
and Oscar-winners Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway.
   Turner, owner of Cable News Network and CNN Headline News, also
promises to bid on major award shows, sporting events including the
Olympics and major league baseball, and other showcase programs.
   Turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get TNT
initially.
   ``It's far less important what they launch with than how quickly
they get into 30 million homes,'' said industry analyst Larry
Gerbrandt. ``I think they need to reach 30 million within ... 18 to
24 months to keep to their business plan, and actually they'd like
to do it sooner than that.''
   By reaching 30 million, Turner's contract with the National
Basketball Association will allow him to move a regular schedule of
pro basketball games _ featuring all the NBA teams, not just
Turner's own Atlanta Hawks _ from SuperStation TBS to TNT. That,
Turner said, will free him to show more Hawks games on TBS.
   TNT spokeswoman Allison Berry said early projections had TNT in
30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990, but the increase
in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989.
   Gerbrandt and other analysts suggest TNT is the next step in
cable programming.
   ``TNT creates a basis for cable to compete toe to toe down the
road with what the networks are going to do,'' said Scott Sassa,
the network's 29-year-old executive vice president.
   ``We've moved from cable providing a strong television signal to
becoming a provider of alternative programming, a variety of
programs,'' said Michael Kupinski, an industry analyst with A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   And TNT, which unlike movie channels allows local cable systems
to sell four minutes of advertising each hour, is ``great for the
cable industry itself,'' Kupinski said. ``Any addition in
programming is kind of a big benefit for cable, especially
exclusive programming.''
   The network promises it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for
the first three years into original programming, and Turner himself
told cable company executives in Atlanta for a trade show that the
network would lose $40 million before breaking even.
   ``That 80 percent is crucial,'' Gerbrandt said. Whereas many
cable networks are ``concept-driven _ all-news, all-sports _ this
is a real program-driven idea where it will succeed program by
program,'' he said.
   Sassa estimates it will take two years to lose that $40 million.
   But as Sassa and Turner point out, the start-up costs for TNT
would be greatly increased without Turner's purchase two years ago
of the film libraries.
   ``If we didn't have the MGM library, and the RKO and Warner
libraries, we never could have started the networks and that was a
billion and a half dollar investment,'' Turner said.
   Turner acquired more than 3,000 films when he purchased MGM@UA
Entertainment Co., then sold all but the films to pay for the
transaction.
   The deal left Turner saddled with $1.4 billion of debt, and
raised doubts about whether he could survive. That debt has since
been refinanced, and large cable companies have bought interest in
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., gaining seats on the board of
directors and say-so over large financial decisions.
   Gerbrandt said financial restrictions imposed on Turner by the
cable operators have contributed to the company's ability to
recover from the MGM deal.
   Turner executives also point to that cable participation as a
key to the company's survival, and as a guarantee to the industry
that TBS will remain a key provider of programming for their
systems.
   ``We're not going to take your money and head for Monte Carlo
with it, or take it and put it into a project for CBS, NBC or ABC
like some of the other interests whose ownership is more committed
to network television than it is to the cable industry,'' Turner
told the cable operators.
   Unlike the Fox Network, which broadcasts original programming on
weekend nights over the airwaves, TNT will be a 24-hour cable
operation.
   One of the keys to the success of TNT, according to Gerbrandt,
analyst for Kagan and Associates in Carmel, Calif., is the
acceptance by cable systems, whose limited channel space already is
overwhelmed.
   ``I think the general sense in the industry is that (TNT) is an
idea whose time has come, (but) he's launching it at a time when
channel capacity is not exactly abundant,'' Gerbrandt said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The real push is going to be in systems launching Jan. 1 and
mid-89,'' Gerbrandt said, because that's typically when cable
systems change services as they kick in rate increases.
   ``Also, ... if you're going to change your lineup, you do it at
that time.''
   A recent survey indicates the service has broad support among
some of the major system operators.
   Beaufort, N.C.-based Marquest Research said it interviewed key
executives at 15 companies ranking among the top 25 multiple system
cable operators, including eight of the top 10.
   It said two-thirds of those surveyed said TNT would be given
broad carriage across their systems, with the remaining third
saying carriage would be moderate.
