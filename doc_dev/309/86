   A skeleton of what will be the world's
tallest wooden roller coaster already rises above the trees at Six
Flags Over Texas, and planners are concocting other gut-wrenching
thrills.
   Walt Disney Co. has splurged on a fantasyland of Hollywood
diversions and acquired rights to many of the Muppets, who will
cavort with Mickey and Goofy at Disney theme parks.
   Bidders seeking Sea World may pay more than $1 billion for Shamu,
the killer whale, and other finned celebrities.
   All this maneuvering reflects one common handicap in the $4
billion amusement-park business: Mother Nature still calls most of
the shots in a relatively short season that winds down after Labor
Day. So, the search for new diversions never ends.
   This summer, rain and heat kept many fun parks waiting for the
crowds, although others reported a late surge to surpass year-ago
levels.
   Especially hard hit were the 200 or so water parks, a fairly new
entrant into the amusement game.
   ``Our June was just horrendous,'' said John Seeker, spokesman for
Wet 'N Wild, a water park across the freeway from Six Flags in
Arlington. ``It's almost like summer never came.''
   Others had a better time of it.
   ``We had one weekend in August, which is traditionally one of our
biggest months, where we almost didn't even open. But despite all
that we're well ahead of last year,'' said Ed Carroll, general
manager at Riverside Park in Agawam, Mass., which added six new
water rides this year.
   Crystal Beach was not so lucky. The 101-year-old park in Fort
Erie, Ontario, Canada, just across the bridge from Buffalo, N.Y.,
said it will close down its rides after this season, reflecting
increased competition and dwindling crowds.
   ``This year we just took a nose dive,'' said President Joseph
Biondolillo. ``A lot of it was due to the rainy spring. Then we
started to lose numbers during the good weather.''
   Last year, the nation's 600 amusement parks reported more than
249 million visitors and operators surveyed in July said they
expected about a 2 percent increase this year, taking the early
season weather problems into account.
   But prices may also be holding back attendance.
   Admission to 27-year-old Six Flags Over Texas is $19.95, on the
high end of prices among regional parks.
   ``It's a little steep, especially when all four of us come,''
said Jackie Corley, who was visiting the park on a recent,
100-degree day.
   ``We'd think twice'' about coming back if the price were
increased, she said.
   Even next year's scheduled debut of the $5 million Texas Giant, a
4,920-foot long wooden roller coaster, might not be enough to
overcome the price, she said.
   Daughter Elisa, however, had a different view. She likes the park
``because I can have fun.''
   Roller coasters are a big draw at the larger parks, and are
frequently the main attractions.
   Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, for example, has a much-ballyhooed
new coaster this year _ the $3 million Timberwolf, and attendance is
up 10 percent, park officials said.
   The coaster recently was rated No. 2 in the nation in a survey by
Inside Track, a publication for roller coaster enthusiasts.
   ``We just had to come to see it,'' said Sara Johnson of Topeka,
Kan., at Worlds of Fun on a recent weekend with family members.
   She and family said the park was expensive, but they regarded it
as a special, once-a-summer outing and were willing to pay.
   In Houston, at Six Flags-owned Astroworld, The Viper coaster also
helped the park overcome early season doldrums brought on by
Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Chantal.
   There will be a new ride at Astroworld next year as well, but
spokeswoman Debra Ford wouldn't reveal the nature of the attraction,
except to say, ``it's going to be a great thrill ride.''
   The newest generation of thrills involves motion simulation _
rides that give passengers the feel of hurtling through space, or
under water, or flying an airplane. They can cost from $120,000 to
$2 million each, depending on the sophistication.
   The smaller scale of the motion simulators _ they don't require
towering support structures _ reflect a trend toward downsizing and
regionalization.
   ``We're close to saturation. There's no major metropolitan area
in the United States that doesn't have a park within easy driving
distance,'' said Peter Irish, an official with the International
Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, an industry group in
Alexandria, Va.
   As a result, IAAPA trade shows include seminars on miniature
golf, go-cart tracks, batting cages and arcades, Irish said.
   Parks also are turning to concerts and other entertainment to
draw people during slack times. An IAAPA survey this summer showed
more than 30 percent of the projects planned for the largest parks
were for entertainment.
   The parks are hoping to attract more customers like Paul and
Paula Jarvis of Bowie, Md., who visited Williamsburg, Va.'s Busch
Gardens along with their grandchildren.
   ``We like the shows,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ``We really don't go for
the rides too much.''
   Regional does not mean less lucrative. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. is selling off its parks _ four Sea Worlds, plus other smaller
parks near its Orlando headquarters _ and it is estimated the deal
could bring the publisher $1.5 billion, 23 times what HBJ paid for
the three Sea Worlds it bought in 1976.
   Bigger is still better as far as players like Disney are
concerned, however.
   With this year's addition of the new Disney-MGM Studios theme
park in Florida and the announced purchase of rights to the Muppet
characters this past week, Disney's pursuit of new attractions has
reached Barnum-esque proportions.
   The Disney-MGM theme park is a $400 million playground with
diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to
recreations of 1940s Hollywood Boulevard.
   ``The public response to the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park
has been overwhelming, beyond our wildest dreams. It has led to our
decision to expand the park, doubling it in size in the next two
years,'' spokesman John Dreyer said.
   The company refuses to disclose attendance figures, but one
analyst estimates as many as 150,000 a day pass through the Disney
gates in Florida, paying $100 for a four-day ticket.
   Its size and variety make a Disney a ``destination park'' in the
lingo of the amusement business. It also profits from nearby
attractions that have sprung up in its shadow and feed off its
success. The Orlando area is home to Sea World, Boardwalk and
Baseball, Cypress Gardens and Busch Gardens nearby in Tampa. In
addition, MCA Inc. is investing $600 million in a Universal Studio
park near Orlando to compete with Disney.
