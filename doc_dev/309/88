   President Bush and his wife Barbara expressed
sadness Wednesday upon learning of the deaths of entertainment
greats Sammie Davis Jr. and Jim Henson.
   The White House released tributes to both men.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Bushes were ``long-time
admireres of Mr. Davis, who has given a lifetime to bringing joy to
others through his special entertainment and good will.''
   ``Mr. Davis has been a major figure in the entertainment world.
His legacy of humor and songs, as well as charity work, will
continue to be a part of future generations,'' the spokesman said.
   The Bushes spoke last Saturday by telephone to Davis' wife as
the 64-year-old entertainer lay dying of cancer.
   On the sudden death from a bacterial infection of Henson, the
53-year-old creator of the Muppets, Mrs. Bush's press office
released a statement saying:
   ``Mr. Henson's pioneering contribution through the educational
and entertaining Sesame Street and Muppets characters was unique in
the history of television.
   ``His dedication to wholesome children's programming has
enlivened the minds of young and old alike. Mr. Henson's
originality and creativity will influence entertainers, educators
and, most important of all, children for generations to come.''
   Mrs. Bush recently appeared on Sesame Street to promote her
literacy campaign.
