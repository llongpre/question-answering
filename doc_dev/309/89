<P>
It's a small world and it may be getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
If the nation's leading amusement parks are right, you soon will not need to 
travel far beyond Southern California or central Florida to explore the world 
of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
After all, outer-space aliens and Indiana Jones should be invading Disneyland 
at about the same time that Soviet and Swiss pavilions come to Walt Disney 
World. Universal Studios Hollywood will soon offer rides that travel Back to 
the Future or follow E.T. through the darkness. Patrons at Sea World in San 
Diego this spring should be able to feed bat rays and see sharks in a gigantic 
new Forbidden Reef pool. 
</P>
<P>
And those plans are only the beginning. Throughout the amusement-park industry, 
major players are gearing up to battle the acknowledged king of fantasy -- Walt 
Disney Co. -- for a greater share of amusement park patrons and their 
leisure-time dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The contest intensified earlier this month after the the company announced "The 
Disney Decade" -- a 10-year, multibillion-dollar plan to expand its theme parks 
in Anaheim and Lake Buena Vista, Fla., as well as its Florida resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The plans include development of two new theme areas at Disneyland, as well as 
scores of new rides and attractions at the 35-year-old park, plus a 
long-awaited, $1-billion, separate-admission theme park in either Anaheim or 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, described 
plans to build seven new resort hotels, 29 new shows and attractions and a 
fourth gated theme park -- rumored to be a Coney Island attraction or an animal 
park. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, the plans come as no surprise to amusement industry 
experts who have come to expect costly razzle-dazzle from the world's most 
successful entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is complete smoke and pixie dust," one Southland competitor 
sniffed. Without the two new theme parks on the drawing boards, the 10-year 
plan amounts to "nothing more than the standard improvements that go into 
Disney's theme parks every year." 
</P>
<P>
Other industry experts see it differently. The cute little mouse, to some, is 
starting to look more like a voracious rat. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is looking over their shoulder at Disney," said Nick Winslow, 
president of Harrison Price Co., a Torrance-based economic consultant to the 
leisure-time industry. "They're all very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as one tourism insider put it: "Disney sneezes and they all catch cold." 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms include a reassessment by most of the major amusement park 
companies of their long-range plans -- even though virtually all will not 
acknowledge concern. As Larry Cochran, president and chief executive of Six 
Flags Corp. of Arlington, Tex., put it: "Disney is Disney, and there's only 
going to be one of them. Nobody in the world can compete with Disney, unless 
it's MCA." MCA owns Universal Studios Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not stop everybody else from at least trying to keep pace with 
Mickey Mouse's company as it builds a better people trap. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's expansion plan is widely viewed among competitors as a clear signal 
that the company is not about to abandon its highly profitable Southern 
California park -- or let its grip slip on the increasingly important market 
near Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
It's small wonder. Nationwide, major theme parks bring in more than $3 billion 
annually, industry analysts estimate. Of the 253 million visits Americans made 
to theme parks last year, more than 44 million were to Walt Disney World and 
Disneyland, according to the International Assn. of Amusement Parks &amp; 
Attractions, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
For Disney, that means big bucks. Its theme parks and resort operations 
produced about 64% of the company's annual operating profits and 56% of revenue 
coming in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Net income for 1989 was $703.3 
million, up 35% from 1988, on revenue of $4.6 billion, up 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that success has come since 1972, when Disney almost single-handedly 
began building Orlando into a major tourist spot -- and Walt Disney World into 
the most popular vacation destination in the country. 
</P>
<P>
One key to Disney World's prosperity is that it gives customers lots of reasons 
to spend as much time as possible at its 6,600 developed acres of hotels, 
nightspots, restaurants, golf courses, water parks and, of course, theme parks 
-- the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and the new Disney-MGM Studio Theme Park. 
</P>
<P>
With an average length of stay at Disney property hotels slightly more than 
three days, more often than not "every penny that you spend goes into Disney 
pockets," one competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
To help ensure that flow, when its studio theme park opened early last year, 
Disney began offering four-day park passes -- $97 for adults, $77 for each 
child -- and eliminated three-day passes. That gives customers a tough option 
of buying one $30.65 pass for one theme park or plunking down the cost of a 
four-day ticket to all three parks. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's plans to build a marine-oriented theme park in Long Beach or a second 
gated park on 40 acres that the company owns near the Anaheim park could have a 
similar goal here, industry observers say. With a second park, Disney could 
easily increase how much time patrons stay at its Southland theme parks by 
selling four-day passes. (Disneyland now sells three-day passes at $66.50 for 
adults and $53.25 for children.) 
</P>
<P>
That means that "instead of providing entertainment for eight hours, Disney can 
provide hotel rooms, food, merchandise and everything that is related for 
several days," said Ray Braun, senior vice president with Economics Research 
Associates, a Los Angeles-based economic consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts are betting that is exactly what will happen -- assuming that 
Disney can solve the tough traffic, parking and other "infrastructure" problems 
that Eisner stressed must be decided before the second California theme park 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Times, Eisner promised a Disney hotel expansion 
-- offering a themed motif throughout -- if the plans for a second gate come 
true in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
While Disney's expansion presents a challenge, some Disney competitors see a 
bright side for them. They said the expansion of theme parks can only help 
everybody else, who will ride Disney's coattails. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything Disney does to attract more people to Southern California is good for 
all of us," said Stuart Zanville, spokesman for Knott's Berry Farm in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, at least some industry experts acknowledge that the 
competition will be much stiffer and will pressure other amusement parks to 
upgrade their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Studios Hollywood, owned by MCA Inc., is moving forward with a 
much-ballyhooed -- and much-delayed -- three-year, $142-million expansion. The 
agenda includes the planned addition next year of a $35-million E.T. ride, 
followed in 1992 by a Back to the Future attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The two major rides will be the first ever at Universal Studios Hollywood that 
are not part of the two-hour studio tour -- a major shift in direction for 
Universal, industry experts said. Theme park industry sources view Universal's 
willingness to plunk down a very sizable $35 million for E.T. as the start of 
the attraction's grab for more local patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Of the 5.1 million patrons who visited Universal Studios Hollywood 
last year, roughly 78% are from outside Southern California. That is far higher 
than Disneyland, for example, where about half of its 13 million customers in 
1989 came from outside the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
By adding new attractions, industry insiders said, Universal clearly is making 
a bid for customers who traditionally have been attracted to Disneyland and 
Knott's -- local residents who return more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Bullard, Universal spokeswoman, denied that the new attractions are a 
response to Disney or mark more than the evolutionary development of the studio 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
But industry experts noted that Universal Studios began trying to attract more 
local customers by introducing the Earthquake show in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake subject matter was no accident, believe me," said Winslow, the 
consultant. "Universal just had to look at its data to realize it's not getting 
its fair share of locals, and the Earthquake show brought in locals." 
</P>
<P>
Using glitzy new rides to draw local customers is not the only way that 
Universal will be fighting harder on its home turf. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that appears to be mirroring Disney's development in Florida, MCA 
Inc. plans to break ground in September on a quarter-mile shopping street at 
Universal City, which will link the 18-screen Cineplex Odeon with the studio 
tour entrance and two restaurants. The retail street is the first phase of a 
long-term development that MCA is planning for Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by introducing the E.T. and Back to the Future attractions -- as well 
as others in Florida -- Universal will have a complete cast of characters 
capable of matching Mickey, Kermit and Dumbo -- or Snoopy at Knott's -- said 
Dick Lyon, who heads the Lyon Group, a Pacific Palisades-based consultant to 
the leisure-time field. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, meanwhile, Universal is giving Disney an even tougher run for 
tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In May, MCA Inc. plans to open its $600-million, 440-acre Universal Studios 
Florida, 12 miles from Disney World. The MCA project is two-thirds the size of 
Disney's 135-acre studio tour and will include attractions themed on such 
blockbuster movies as "Jaws," "Ghostbusters," and "E.T." Patrons can shimmy 
through an 8.3-magnitude Earthquake ride or follow Dr. Brown in a DeLorean 
traveling Back to the Future. 
</P>
<P>
The new studio tour will even outdo the original Universal City version, with a 
full-bodied, 37-foot King Kong swinging from a bridge and attractions in which 
customers can take a screen test, flee the attack of "The Birds," or direct an 
episode of "Murder, She Wrote" -- then buy the videotape to bore their friends 
and relatives back home. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is responding by doubling the entertainment side of the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is also not ignoring Southern California, where 118 million tourists 
visited last year. Orange County alone had 35.1 million tourists in 1989, 
according to the Anaheim Visitor and Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
With those numbers, it's no wonder that Disney is eyeing a second gate. If the 
new theme park ends up in Long Beach, it "will certainly take advantage of the 
fact that we're on the water," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said Disney is considering a nautical attraction 
that "obviously will be ocean-oriented and educational -- not a Pleasure 
Island," referring to Disney's water park in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And that is sure to cut into the tourist traffic to Sea World of California in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not particularly concerned," said Bob Gault, president of the San Diego 
attraction. "We do marine life better than anyone else in the world. With Shamu 
and our killer whales, we're in a very strong position." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World in San Diego has one big advantage. After years of neglect from 
publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, it should get a boost of badly needed 
capital now that Anheuser-Busch Cos. bought the four Sea World theme parks in 
September. That infusion will begin this spring, when Sea World patrons should 
be able to feed bat rays and see eels and sharks in a $2.5-million Forbidden 
Reef pool. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, executives with Sea World, Knott's Berry Farm and Magic Mountain 
insist that they are distinct enough to complement Disneyland, rather than 
competing nose to nose. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our niche" of specializing in thrill rides and roller coasters, said 
Cochran, president of Six Flags, which has seven parks including Magic Mountain 
in Valencia. After all, 67% of Magic Mountain's customers are age 24 or 
younger. That's far different from, say, the throngs of families who flock to 
Disney attractions. 
</P>
<P>
In the theme park business, one sure way to bring back business is to give them 
a new thrill -- in other words, a new attraction that gives local patrons a 
reason to return to an amusement park. So major parks typically add at least 
one new attraction -- a ride, a parade or a show -- at least every other year. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm, for example, in April is unleashing Boomerang, a $5-million 
roller coaster. Magic Mountain, not to be outdone, is adding its own 
white-knuckler, the $8-million Viper, "the tallest, fastest, most astonishing 
steel roller coaster," which will race along at 70 m.p.h. and spiral upside 
down seven times. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, though, Magic Mountain executives are looking at more than 
steel rides to keep its turnstiles churning. If outside developers' plans gel 
to build hotels, golf courses, homes and offices near Magic Mountain, the 
amusement park hopes to start operating almost year-round within the next few 
years, said Joe Schillaci, president of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Magic Mountain could start marketing itself as a package along with 
Universal Studios so "people can spend several days" in a resort-like setting, 
Cochran suggested. 
</P>
<P>
After all the new rides, parades and hoopla, what else is there? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, competitors can try offering slightly lower admission prices. 
"There's not much else they can do," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill 
Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. "They can spend a lot of money on marketing, but 
there's not much they can do to compete against Disney."
