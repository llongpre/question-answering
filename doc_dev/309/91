   A bigger, flashier Disneyland _ possibly
including an ``Indiana Jones'' stunt attraction and a 1930s-style
Hollywood movie lot _ are on the drawing boards, Disney officials
said in a report published Tuesday.
   Officials are keeping a tight lid on their plans, reportedly the
most ambitious since the park's opening in 1955, until Friday, when
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner is scheduled to make an announcement.
   ``It involves the next 10 years, but I can't tell you anymore,''
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said in the report published in the
Orange County Register. ``Obviously he (Eisner) wants to make the
announcement.''
   Last week, Disneyland President Richard Nunis showed the plans
to several park employees.
   The employees said the plans include a stunt attraction based on
the ``Indiana Jones'' movies that could go near the park's Thunder
Mountain Railroad ride and the Hollywood back lot, which apparently
would be similar to one at Florida's Disneyworld.
   Employees said other attractions would be based on the Muppet
characters, which Disney bought the rights to last year, and the
Roger Rabbit cartoon character. A new Muppet movie is also a
possibility, the employees were told.
   ``They said none of this was guaranteed,'' said Disney employee
Christy Bauer. ``But I got the impression that it was probably
going to happen because everything was really detailed.''
   Disney has about 78 acres available for expansion in Anaheim,
including about 30 acres within the park.
   Anaheim City Manager Bob Simpson said he hadn't heard of any
proposed expansion.
   ``We've been talking about expanding Disneyland for years,'' he
said, ``but everybody agrees that nothing can be done until we do
something about the traffic in the commercial-recreation area.''
