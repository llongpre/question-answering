   Ted Turner enlisted a new ally, Kermit the Frog. 

   The flamboyant entrepreneur's Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it has acquired a four-year exclusive on U.S. telecast rights to all 120 existing half-hour episodes of "The Muppet Show." 

   Financial terms weren't disclosed. 
The four-year period will begin in October, after the Aug. 31 expiration of rights held by ITC Entertainment Group, New York. 

   The rights were sold by Jim Henson Productions, New York, the creator of the popular puppet show, which is no longer in new production. (The first run of the series ended in 1981.) 
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting said the two companies also would collaborate "on several new television projects." 

   "The Muppet Show" will be carried on the pending Turner cable-TV network, Turner Network Television, or TNT, which is scheduled to start up Oct. 3. 
The show will be available to the Turner "SuperStation," Atlanta-based TBS, but as yet hasn't been scheduled by the station.
