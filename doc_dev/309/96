   The Disney-MGM Studios theme park
opened to the public today with a ceremony complete with comedian
Bob Hope and a shower of gifts for the first family to enter the
$400 million attraction.
   ``It's overwhelming. We never expected anything like this,''
said Allan Gutierrez of York, Pa., who camped outside the
turnstiles with his family since 2 a.m., six hours before the gates
opened.
   Gutierrez, his wife, two teen-age daughters and father-in-law
were honored by Hope and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner at an
outdoor stage at the end of re-created Hollywood Boulevard and in
front of the Chinese Theater.
   Costumed performers sang and danced, several hundred white doves
were released overhead and fireworks lit up the cloudy skies as the
Gutierrez family was introduced to opening-day visitors.
   There were no official estimates of the crowd, but Disney had
anticipated that by the end of the day today, at least 15,000
people would visit the attraction blending movie and TV production
with a backstage tour and other activities for the public.
   The theme of the park is the golden age of Hollywood in the
1930s and 1940s. It is Walt Disney World's third major attraction,
after the original Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center nearby.
   Hope quipped that this was ``the largest theme park run by
actors and cartoon characters _ unless you want to count
Washington, D.C.''
   The Gutierrez family received lifetime passes to Disney
attractions worldwide, silver-colored Mickey Mouse ears and a
9-inch statuette called Mouse-ker, patterned after moviedom's Oscar
award.
   ``We didn't known anything about a first family. We just wanted
to be here early to be sure and see everything today before we go
home,'' said Mrs. Gutierrez.
   Eisner told the crowd that the park is ``dedicated to Hollywood
... a world that never was and always will be.''
