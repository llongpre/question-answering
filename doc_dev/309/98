<TEXT>     "If Jim were here, he would have said, 'This is neat,' " Henson's longtime
agent and friend Bernie Brillstein told newshawks at the unveiling of the
1,938th star.;   No music was played and none of the "Muppets" characters
appeared. But there was a double-decker bus bearing a "We miss Jim" sign. It
rolled by as Kermit-green helium-filled balloons were released.  </TEXT>
