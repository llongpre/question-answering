<TEXT>  Business One-Irwin, 315 pp., $22.95;  THE Disney Touch" is the first
full-length biography of the Walt Disney Co., a book one would have hoped
could take its place beside "Storming the Magic Kingdom," John Taylor's fine
account of the last days of the old company during which the heirs of the
Great Walt did little more than fend off corporate raiders. That book ended
when Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg began their successful, almost
legendary resuscitation of the company. Although their efforts have been
endlessly celebrated in the press, no one has given this subject the
book-length attention it deserves.;    Ron Grover, the Los Angeles bureau
chief of Business Week, would seem to be eminently suited for that job, and
indeed, he is an excellent reporter. With an implicit nod at the ink already
spilled on Disney, Grover doesn't spend an undue amount of time telling us
what we already know about Katzenberg and his remarkable success with the
studio. Rather, he tells us what we don't know about Eisner, Frank Wells and
aspects of the company that have remained in the studio's shadow -- the theme
parks, the home-video division, the television division and the new retail
stores -- with details only a business reporter could love, such as how
Disney, through Silver Screen Partners, cleverly got others to shoulder some
of the risk attendant on financing its movies.;    The Mouse trap; If some of
the by-now-familiar story is told again here -- how the new Disney group
cleaned house (firing 1,000 employees), broke a strike at the parks, raised
ticket prices, refused to wear anything with "the Mouse" on it and revived the
flagging careers of Bette Midler and Richard Dreyfuss -- Grover fleshes it
out. For example, we learn that the old Disney management let "Raiders of the
Lost Ark" slip through its fingers because the company was too cheap to give
"points" to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Then they passed on "E.T." (One
of the first things Eisner did was to hire Lucas to develop rides for the
parks.) We learn that "Captain EO" may have been the most expensive film ever
made ($1 million a minute), and that Warners allowed Bugs Bunny to appear in
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" only if he had the same number of lines as Mickey
Mouse.;    More revealingly, Grover attributes Disney's success in part to the
fact that it stayed clear of acquisitions during the takeover frenzy of the
'80s, preferring to follow a do-it-yourself policy. Disney negotiated a deal
with Marriott to build and run hotels near the parks, but then refused to
sign, plunging aggressively (and successfully) into the hotel business. In the
same vein, it started its own publishing company and music division instead of
gobbling up existing properties.;    Dazzled by the subjects;  The main
problem with this book is that it is so intoxicated with the Disney success
story that it gives short shrift to the problems Disney faces. Let's start
with the title: The Disney touch it's not. Disney's hand is well known to be
considerably heavier than "touch" would suggest. But light or heavy aside,
this book actually should be entitled "The Disney Version," since the author
apparently talked to very few people outside the company.;    Grove is too
dazzled by his subjects, whom he insists on referring to as "Team Disney." He
opens the acknowledgments with effusive praise for the principals of the book,
and writes, "I owe my greatest debt of gratitude to Hollywood's best
public-relations executive, Erwin Okun. A man of grace and understanding, he
provided wise counsel and opened many locked doors for me." No offense to
Okun, who probably is a good guy and as charming as Grover says, but he is a
publicist, and this is supposed to be a hard look at the company he works
for.;    Although Disney's tiff with the Jim Henson estate is mentioned,
reading this book would never have prepared us for the violent feud that
erupted last April. In fact, the author never fully explores the extent and
depth of the ill will toward Disney rampant in the creative community, nor its
implications for the future.;    An exodus of talent;    The studio has been
plagued with repeated defections by talent it nurtured and then would not pay
to keep. In two cases Grover does mention, after doing "Good Morning Vietnam"
(it grossed $123 million for Disney), director Barry Levinson wanted to triple
his $1.5 million salary; Disney refused, and Levinson went on to make "Rain
Man," his next film and a huge hit, for another studio. Zucker, Zucker and
Abrahams, who had made "Airplane" for Katzenberg at Paramount and "Ruthless
People" at Disney's Touchstone, returned to Paramount (where they went on to
make "Naked Gun" and "Ghosts") when Disney would not meet their demands -- $1
million each, up from the $1 million the three divided for "Ruthless People.";
   Waning magic;    With profits down 29 percent in the last quarter, Disney
is experiencing a lengthy dry spell unprecedented since Eisner and Katzenberg
took over in 1984. The populist, anti-business formula that paradoxically
(remember, it was the Reagan decade) fueled its biggest hits has worn thin,
and no sure-fire replacement has yet appeared. Whereas three years ago, every
creative decision the studio made seemed blessed by genius, now they all seem
equally misguided. Whereas Disney's frugal ways might seem ideally suited to a
period of economic hardship, it still has to compete in an arena where other
studios are spending money like water, as Katzenberg acknowledged in his
notorious memo.;    Much of the talent appears to have felt that with success
came a certain arrogance, a sense that the studio could do it better, and it
didn't hesitate to try. While Disney was riding high, it seemed as though
Katzenberg and Co. could do it better, but now, after a string of flops, the
stinginess and hard-nosed, hands-on attitude that worked for it in the past
has made it the place of last resort for actors, writers and directors.;   
Instructive in this regard is Grover's discussion of one of the few areas in
which Disney has not had unqualified success: network television. Initially,
Disney pursued television with the same strategy it adopted in features. It
turned its back on expensive deals with hot producers in favor of economy
deals with younger, less successful or otherwise cheaper talent. But with few
exceptions, the shows flopped. Television is producer-driven, and Disney
discovered that if it wanted to compete, it not only had to pay the going rate
for top talent but also grant that talent a degree of autonomy.;     Now the
lessons of the television division would seem to apply to motion pictures as
well, and Disney has begun to spend the kind of money it wouldn't have dreamed
of spending three years ago: $1 million for scripts such as "Ultimatum" and
"Hell Bent -- and Back.";    On the basis of its recent setbacks, it would be
foolish to conclude that Disney has lost the magic. As Grover shows in great
detail, Eisner and Katzenberg brilliantly exploited the assets they found when
they took over the company, and equally brilliantly created new ones, such as
the Disney retail outlets. Its summer movie, "Rocketeer," looks as if it will
put the studio back in the winning column, and it also appears that Disney's
investment in TV talent may finally pay off next year, when the networks will
air an unprecedented number of Disney shows.;    European expansion;  As it
enters the '90s, the company is vigorously expanding on the theme-park front,
with Euro Disneyland scheduled to open outside Paris in 1992. In 1990, Disney
had more than 100 films in various stages of development, at a cost of $140
million, as against $65 million in 1988. But what does seem to be true is that
the golden age of Disney's double-digit expansion may be over, and that the
company will increasingly appear merely mortal, subject to the same kinds of
slings and arrows that afflict other entertainment companies. Grover gives a
serviceable account of these changes, but the definitive book on Disney
remains to be written.  </TEXT>
