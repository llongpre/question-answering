   Kermit, Miss Piggy and many of the
other Muppets will be joining ranks with Mickey Mouse and his
friends in an agreement announced today by Walt Disney World and
Muppet creator Jim Henson.
   Henson and Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of the
Walt Disney Co., said they have signed an agreement-in-principle for
Disney to acquire Henson Associates Inc., including its film and
television library.
   Both Henson and Eisner, announcing the agreement at a morning
news conference, would not disclose the price of the transaction.
   The proposal includes long-term consulting and exclusive
production agreements, with Henson producing motion pictures,
network and off-network television shows, Disney Channel specials
and series and made-for-home video programming, the release said.
   Also included are special Muppet attractions and rides for Disney
theme parks.
   ``I've loved Disney for many years,'' Henson told reporters. ``I
grew up on its movies... and I love the Disney parks, so we're happy
to have our characters at the parks now.''
   Work is already under way for the first project, a Muppet film
attraction using 3-D technology. The attraction, to open next spring
at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park here, will be a collaboration
between Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering.
   Disney will also have the merchandising, publishing and other
rights to Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and other
Muppets.
   Although Eisner refused to discuss the cost of the agreement, he
said ``we will have a good return on our investment with just the
material that is there already. This is not to mention what's
coming, what is yet to be created.''
   In a news release earlier, he hailed the proposal as ``a business
association made in family entertainment heaven.''
   Henson, winner of several Emmy awards, introduced Kermit the Frog
and other Muppets to television in the 1950s. His library includes
the television shows ``The Muppet Show,'' ``Fraggle Rock,'' and
``Muppet Babies'' and the films ``The Muppet Movie,'' ``The Great
Muppet Caper'' and ``The Dark Crystal.''
   Henson's puppet segments and characters created for the
children's show ``Sesame Street,'' including ``Big Bird'' and
``Oscar the Grouch,'' aren't included in the agreement.
   Eisner said the ``non-profit continuing involvement'' between
Henson and the children's show would continue unchanged.
   Although Kermit appears on Sesame Street, the character is not
considered exclusive to that show.
