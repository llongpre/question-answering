   Walt Disney Co., which treasures its gentle image,
supposedly backed away from certain demands in its failed
negotiations to buy the late Jim Henson's company because it
feared "a public relations nightmare."
   Yesterday, it got one anyway.

   Henson Associates Inc. filed a 93-page lawsuit against the
Burbank, Calif., entertainment concern in federal court in
New York. The suit, rich with anti-Disney invective, is the
first public display of a marriage made in heaven that turned
into a divorce from hell.
   The complaint charges Disney with "an ongoing pattern" of
copyright and trademark infringement in connection with
Henson's Muppet characters. It seeks to block the coming
opening in Florida's Walt Disney World of a new "Kermit the
Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D" attraction, and the promotion
of it, saying Disney doesn't have a license to use the
characters. The suit seeks unspecified damages.
   It further charges Disney with fraud in an alleged scheme
to drain Henson's "creative juices" by conducting spurious
negotiations to buy the company until Henson employees put
finishing touches on the Muppetvision attraction. Then Disney
calculatedly broke off negotiations, the suit claims. Henson
also accuses Disney of "extreme arrogance," "corporate greed"
and of "exploiting {Jim Henson's} legacy."
   The suit even complains that Disney sold T-shirts
depicting Kermit in a "lurid neon green," which Jim Henson
never would have authorized, and objects to the use of the
Muppets in Disney's annual report. It plays on the apparent
irony of Disney's obsession with protecting its own
copyrights, and paints a picture of tiny, creative Henson up
against a corporate Goliath.
   Disney, summoning up some invective itself, called the
lawsuit "outrageous" and an "enormous distortion of the
facts."
   The bad blood between the keepers of Mickey Mouse and Miss
Piggy stems from the August 1989 Disney agreement to acquire
Henson for $150 million in cash and stock. Disney executives
gushed that it was "a perfect marriage . . . made in family
entertainment heaven."
   But nine months later, with no final deal in place after
long (and Disney says, disappointing) due diligence by
Disney, Jim Henson died of a massive bacterial infection at
age 53. Henson says Disney Chairman Michael Eisner personally
assured the family that the price wouldn't change, and
negotiations resumed. A major issue was easing the estate tax
burdens of the five Henson children.
   Finally, a deal including Disney preferred stock -- which
would better back a loan to pay the Hensons' taxes -- was
worked out, with the price remaining the same, a Henson
source says. But the talks became intense: The suit says two
Henson negotiators were offered jobs with Disney when the
deal was closed, and a lawyer from the law firm of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, which had worked for Disney, was
threatened with the loss of Disney business.
   Disney also broached the supposedly taboo subject of
Henson's Sesame Street characters such as Big Bird and Cookie
Monster, which are controlled by the nonprofit Children's
Television Workshop and weren't included in the original
Disney talks by Mr. Henson's decree. The suit says Disney
asked Henson to restrict further licensing of the Sesame
Street characters, particularly in theme parks. But Disney
backed off, fearing a "public relations nightmare," the suit
says.
   Last December, just as the Muppetvision attraction was
being finished, Disney President Frank Wells unexpectedly
asked the Hensons to slash $25 million from the purchase
price, the suit says. Disney now says, however, that it
offered $50 million in additional payments and the assumption
of new costs and risks but that Henson sought $75 million.
   After acquisition talks broke off, the two companies began
negotiating over a license fee for the Muppetvision
attraction. Henson says it asked Disney to stop using the
Muppets in ads, without success. Disney began demanding that
Henson give it exclusive right to Muppet characters in theme
parks, the suit says.
   Despite the recent hiring by Henson of powerhouse Creative
Artists Agency to try to bring the two sides together,
negotiations broke off Tuesday and the Henson camp decided to
file the suit.
   Henson sees the litigation as a public relations shot
across Disney's bow, but Henson executives also fear Disney
is prepared "to litigate them to death," the complaint
states.
   Disney said in its statement that Henson had tried
everything to "scuttle the arrangement" with Disney since Mr.
Henson's death. Disney says it has $90 million invested in
various Henson-related activities "with the family's
knowledge and consent." On March 22, the company noted,
Henson officials visited Muppetvision and didn't recommend
any substantive changes. And Disney insisted it will "make
every effort to have Jim Henson's dream of having these
attractions at Walt Disney World still come true."
   Lisa Henson, Mr. Henson's oldest daughter, says she finds
the invoking of her late father's name by Disney "offensive."
She adds: "This idea that the Henson kids beat up on Disney
is so absurd. I'm appalled that people believe that. They
played total hardball with us every second."
