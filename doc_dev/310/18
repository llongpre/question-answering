   Despite the death of Jim Henson, Ponce D.
Lion and the other Muppets he created will still get a series on
the Disney Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be
produced as planned, a Disney spokesman said.
   Henson, who sold rights to the immensely popular Muppets to Walt
Disney Co. last year for a reported $150 million, died Wednesday at
age 53.
   The long-term deal that brought Kermit and Miss Piggy to the
Disney menagerie included Henson's creative services as well as the
use of the Muppet characters, which are seen on TV in 100
countries. It was announced last August, but is still not final.
   Henson's office in New York declined comment on how the death
would affect the agreement with Disney. But Disney spokesman Erwin
Okun said, ``I've talked with the key people involved in the deal,
and they expect everything will proceed as usual.''
   ``He will be sorely missed, no question. But the Henson
organization is great,'' Okun said. ``Even with a giant, as he was,
it's not just a one-man organization.''
   ``Jim would be the first to say, `The show must go on,''' said
Dick Nunis, a Disney executive in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
   Still, Henson's death added a note of uncertainty to future
Disney projects, if not the ones under way.
   Henson's creations and talent were a key part of Disney Co.
Chairman Michael Eisner's plans to cross-market characters
worldwide through films, cable and network TV, retail stores,
restaurants, home video, character licensing, theme parks and
resorts.
   Analyst Jeff Logsdon at the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. brokerage in
Los Angeles noted that the Muppets are probably second only to
Disney in worldwide recognition. Eisner called the alliance a
``marriage made in family entertainment heaven.''
   In an interview this year with The Associated Press, Henson said
he was happy to see his characters frolicking in the Disney
environments.
   ``I love the parks,'' Henson said. ``They have been among my
favorite places for years. Now that I'm actually designing things
for the parks, I'm having a lot of fun.''
   ``Obviously he was a great creative spark and a genius, and his
loss will be felt,'' said Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch
entertainment analyst. ``He would have come up with lots of others
things if he'd lived another 10 or 15 years.
