   Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other
Muppets have been given the keys to the Disney castle, and will soon
join Mickey Mouse, Dumbo and the other regulars at Disney theme
parks.
   Later, Muppets will star in Disney movies and television shows.
   ``There is virtually no area in which there isn't an opportunity
for Jim Henson to make an enormous contribution,'' said Jeffrey
Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios.
   Henson, the creator of the Muppets, and the Walt Disney Co.
announced an agreement Monday to put at Disney's disposal all of the
existing Muppet characters and their library of film and television
shows.
   That's not mentioning ``what is to come, what will be created,''
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said.
   The merger of the two kiddie entertainment giants will blend the
colorful characters from ``The Muppet Show'' _ the most widely seen
TV program in the world with an estimated 235 million viewers in
some 100 countries _ into Disney's theme parks, movies, TV shows and
retail merchandising products.
   Katzenberg said the Muppets will be presented at the Disney-MGM
Studios theme park in a state-of-the-art ``interactive 3-D
experience. We will use many technologies in doing some things that
have never been done before.'' The Muppet theater will open next
Memorial Day.
   Henson and Eisner refused to disclose the purchase price of
Henson Associates Inc. It has been reported as ranging from $100
million to $150 million.
   ``I've loved Disney. I grew up on its movies. . . and I'm happy
to have the Muppets at the parks,'' said the bearded Henson, who
created Kermit in 1955 and followed that up with Miss Piggy, Animal,
Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter and others.
   Henson, who also created most of the stars of the ``Sesame
Street'' television series, will retain his association with that
show separately from the Disney agreement, he and Eisner told
reporters.
   Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster and other Henson
creations for ``Sesame Street'' are not part of the Disney deal.
   Analysts have said the studios' park needed something such as the
Muppets to better compete with rival Universal Studios Florida,
which will have two attractions geared to children when it opens
next May 1.
   Eisner and Henson publicist Susan Berry said the Muppets would
retain their family-oriented humor and not become strictly
children's characters. The Muppets' attraction to small children is
primarily visual, Ms. Berry said.
   ``Miss Piggy, for instance _ whose humor is adult humor _ is not
going to change,'' she said.
   Henson said he it was ``always fun creating new characters. . . I
look forward to that.''
