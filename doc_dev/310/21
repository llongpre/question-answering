   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates Inc.
settled their bitter dispute over the licensing of the Muppet
characters, allowing Disney to operate the Muppet attraction
it built at Walt Disney World in Florida, but under severely
restricted terms.
   Henson, for its part, received an apology and a licensing
agreement with both a shorter term and more limited
exclusivity than Disney had sought. This has the effect of
giving Henson more freedom to sell the company or license the
Muppet characters to one of Disney's rivals. Henson agreed to
drop the trademark-infringement suit it filed in federal
court in New York after licensing talks collapsed April 16,
and Disney agreed to withdraw its counterclaim. A trial had
been set for May 13.

   The agreement, valued at more than $10 million by people
close to the settlement, calls for Henson to grant Disney an
18-month license for its new attraction, "Kermit the Frog
Presents: MuppetVision 3-D" and for a live stage show, "Here
Come the Muppets," which has been at the park since last
June. During this period, the characters within the
attractions -- Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and others --
will be exclusive to Disney in theme parks east of the
Mississippi.
   Disney also received a 3 1/2-year option to extend these
rights, for a total of five years. The term is notably short.
Disney had sought 10 to 12 years; the exclusivity is for only
the first three years.
   The exclusivity issue was critical, because Henson has
been for sale. Disney agreed to acquire it for $150 million
in cash and stock in August 1989, conducted difficult
negotiations until company founder Jim Henson's death last
May, then negotiated with Mr. Henson's five children until
talks fell apart last December.
   Henson has explored acquisition by other companies,
including entertainment giants with theme-park interests,
notably MCA Inc., a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., and Time Warner Inc., which owns a large stake in Six
Flags.
   Individuals close to the agreement say Henson has creative
control over all advertising and welcomes the Disney exposure
as long as it doesn't talk about "Disney's Muppets." Disney
will be able to sell Muppet merchandise at the park, and
create park-specific merchandise.
   Henson had demanded an apology from Disney and news
releases issued by each company included the phraseology,
"with deep regret for what a Disney spokesman described as a
serious misunderstanding, and apologies to the Henson family
and their company for any harm that may have been caused. . .
