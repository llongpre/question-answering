   The entertainment world lost two major figures on Wednesday,
Sammy Davis Jr., who danced and sang in the spotlight, and Jim
Henson, whose creative genius gave center stage to Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Henson, who created Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and Big Bird,
died unexpectedly of complications from pneumonia. He was 53.
   Davis, who became an entertainment institution as the gilded
song-and-dance man who ``could do it all,'' died after an
eight-month battle with throat cancer. He was 64.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills commented on hearing of Henson's death.
   And Joey Bishop, who with Davis, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin
formed the core of Hollywood's fun-loving, high-living but
hard-working ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s, said of Davis: ``I guess
they need a good show up in heaven, that's all I can say. He was a
wonderful person.''

<HEAD>Henson Dies At New York Hospital</HEAD>

   Henson had been admitted to New York Hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated for at least three
days, the hospital said. He was 53.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at the hospital, said
Henson apparently came down with the flu on Friday in North
Carolina, and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the
pneumonia.
   His condition worsened and Henson returned to New York on
Monday, but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multi-organ
failure, Gelmont said. In response to a reporter's question,
Gelmont said the pneumonia was not AIDS-related.
   Henson's creatures first appeared in 1954, and he watched them
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon
and multimillion-dollar industry.
   His ``Sesame Street'' characters, from Kermit to Oscar the
Grouch to Big Bird, were welcomed into homes around the United
States each morning for the past 21 years. It was too soon to
assess how his death would affect the show, said spokeswoman Mary
Sue Holland.
   ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred Kermit and Miss Piggy and
debuted in 1976, became the most widely seen television program in
the world, attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries. His magic touch was evident again this year with his
work on the box office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's Television
Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   An emotional Lena Horne, who appeared frequently with Henson's
characters over the past 20 years, said she had missed the
puppeteer Tuesday night at a gathering of the ``Sesame Street''
cast and friends. But she had no idea Henson was near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' she said.
   Fred Rogers, host of another children's program, Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, noted Henson's enormous contributions to public
television.
   ``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands
and himself into them,'' Rogers said.
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a friend and
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world,'' Okun said. ``He was a giant in the entertainment
industry. We are also grieving for his wonderful family.''
   Henson married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five
children.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the Walt Disney
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and other animal characters created by Henson into its
theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products.
   Millions of children grew up on ``Sesame Street,'' which is seen
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English to children around the world.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936.

<HEAD>Davis Dies At Home in Beverly Hills</HEAD>

   Davis's business manager Shirley Rhodes told reporters outside
his house in Beverly Hills that he died there ``peacefully in his
sleep'' with his wife, Altovise, and three of his four children
present.
   Frank Sinatra said of Davis:
   ``I wish the world could have known Sam as I did. It was a
generous God who gave him to us for all these years, and a heaven
with his magic gives me warmth.''
   ``Sammy was a little prince who loved everything life had to
offer,'' said Shirley MacLaine, another ``rat-packer.''
   ``I am numb with pain. He was my inspiration. He's the performer
we all strived to live up to. I never saw anyone give so much,''
said Liza Minnelli, who toured with Davis and Sinatra last year.
   ``He gave his heart and soul to every performance and he was a
true American institution. There will never be another one like
Sammy,'' said former President Reagan.
   ``He'll never be replaced and my sympathies go to his wife and
children,'' said Milton Berle, who had known Davis for more than 60
years.
   ``People just couldn't get enough of Sammy. He could do it all _
sing, dance, comedy,'' Bob Hope said.
   Davis, whose hit songs included ``The Candy Man'' and ``I've
Gotta Be Me,'' was born in New York's Harlem on Dec. 8, 1925, and
began dancing at age 1{.
   Over the years, Davis joked that he was the nation's only
``black, one-eyed, Jewish entertainer.'' He converted to Judaism
while recovering from an automobile accident that cost him his left
eye and nearly took his life.
   An actor, singer, dancer and impressionist, the exuberant Davis
lived life hard and fast. His gold chains, heavy rings and gaudy
bracelets were as much a part of his personality as the chain of
cigarettes he smoked.
   His work on stage, screen and television displayed a versatility
matched by few. Though scorned by some as merely a gilded Las Vegas
drone, and criticized by others as being a token of the ``Rat
Pack,'' Davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainer's
entertainer.
   Davis appeared in more than 20 movies and starred in two
Broadway productions _ ``Mr. Wonderful'' and ``Golden Boy.'' He
received a Tony nomination for best actor in a musical for ``Golden
Boy'' in 1965 but lost to Zero Mostel, who won for ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
   His lively, upbeat manner belied a very difficult life. His
career was scarred by vicious racial bigotry. There were endless
taunts, and at one time, he couldn't gamble or rent a room in some
of the Las Vegas hotels at which he played.
   His second marriage, to Swedish actress Mai Britt, was scorned
by some.
   He also faced drug and alcohol abuse and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer, Little Mo. The movie captures
Davis' last dance performance on film, a brief tap routine made
poignant because he had undergone painful hip surgery in 1985 and
received an artificial hip in 1988.
