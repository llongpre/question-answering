   There has been much argument over the past two
decades about the exact merits of ``Sesame Street,'' but none over
the crucial role Jim Henson's Muppets played in the television
program's phenomenal popularity.
   It was unclear Wednesday what affect Henson's death would have
on the program, which is produced by the Children's Television
Workshop.
   ``There's no way of telling,'' said Mary Sue Holland, a
spokeswoman for CTW. ``We honestly don't know.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 foreign nations. It has been estimated that about
half of all American children between 3 and 5 watch the show.
   Bob McGrath, an actor on the program, returned a telephone call
to The Associated Press but said he and other cast members had been
asked by Henson's family not to speak with the news media. He
referred questions to CTW.
   ``In the beginning (Henson) certainly was the key figure in
developing characters and their style, but over 20 years they've
grown and matured, so there's a team there now,'' said Dr. Milton
Chin, director of instructional television for KQED in San
Francisco and a former researcher for CTW.
   ``There's a lot of talent all around (at Henson Productions),
but they'll be missing the creator,'' he added.
   The Muppets first regular, widespread exposure came when
``Sesame Street'' went on the air in 1969. The characters indulge
in slapstick, introduce video clips and live performances and
participate in skits. They have sung with Ray Charles and played
tennis with Martina Navratilova. Kathleen Turner has read them
bedtime stories, and Tracy Ullman has told them jokes.
   The show's Muppets have been created, assembled and dressed in
Henson's office-factory in Manhattan. He once denied that they were
created with any human personality in mind: ``With Big Bird we knew
we wanted to do a large, a great big character. He should represent
a child, so he can make the kinds of mistakes that kids make, and
talk about it and be out front about that. So we wanted this large,
kooky creature.''
   Henson's contributions to the show twice won him Emmys and made
stars of these characters:
   _Big Bird, the yellow 6-footer who still manages to see and
enjoy life like a small fry.
   _Oscar the Grouch, a beast of indeterminate species who lives in
a garbage can and complains about the (high) quality of life on
Sesame Street.
   _Bert and Ernie, humanoid companions who are attached,
respectively, to a paper clip collection and a yellow rubber duckie.
   _The Cookie Monster, a shaggy blue beast who was named for his
chief weakness.
   _Kermit the Frog, who appears as a live, if bumbling, television
correspondent at the scene of the such fairy tales as The Princess
and the Pea and Cinderella.
   _Guy Smiley, ``America's favorite game show host.''
   _The Count, an Eastern European of noble birth who is obsessed
with numbers.
   Henson was the voice and puppeteer for Kermit, Ernie and Guy
Smiley, and it was hard to see how, at least in this capacity, he
could be replaced.
