   Colleagues and friends around the world
remembered Muppet master Jim Henson as a creative genius who
possessed the carefree spirit of a child.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death was announced.
   ``He was our era's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields and
Marx Brothers,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's
Television Workshop, a non-profit educational company that produces
``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend,'' she said. ``Fortunately for the children of the
world, Jim Henson's work will live on.''
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for the Walt Disney Co., which last summer purchased the rights to
use Henson's characters.
   Henson died early Wednesday at New York Hospital of what the
hospital said was ``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated
for at least three days and resulted in multi-organ failure. He was
53.
   ``I'm absolutely gobsmacked,'' said Mark Shivas, who produced
Henson's television series ``The Storyteller,'' and served as
producer to executive producer Henson on the upcoming Anjelica
Huston movie ``The Witches.''
   Shivas, speaking by telephone from the Cannes Film Festival in
France, said Henson was extraordinarily generous.
   ``Even when one had not worked with him for a year, a Christmas
hamper from Harrods would always arrive.''
   ``The medium of television and the world of entertainment will
miss his vision and his gift,'' Brandon Tartikoff, president of
NBC, for which Henson did ``The Storyteller,'' said in a statement.
   NBC said Henson had been developing a four-hour ``Gulliver's
Travels'' special.
   Lena Horne, who crooned ``It's Not Easy Being Green'' with
Henson's alter ego, Kermit the Frog, said she was overwhelmed by
the news.
   She said she was at a party Tuesday night in tribute to ``Sesame
Street's'' late composer, Joe Raposo, and ``the Cookie Monster gave
me a hello from Jim Henson, who said he was so sorry he couldn't be
there.'' Miss Horne said she had no idea he was sick.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' cast member, said, ``Not only
was Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   McGrath made his comments following an unrelated interview
Wednesday morning at CBS radio. He later said the cast was asked
not to speak about Henson's death.
   ``He was so young and there was so much ahead for him to do for
children's media and children's entertainment,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of the Massachusetts-based Action for Children's
Television.
   She said she considered Henson to be a friend and said ``from
the beginning, Jim couldn't do enough for us.''
   ``Ours was the first network exposure he had,'' said country
singer turned sausage maker Jimmy Dean. Henson's irreverent,
piano-playing puppet, Rowlf the dog, was a favorite on Dean's
television show from 1961 to 1963.
   ``Jim always told me the reason he thought Rowlf was so well
accepted was because I treated him like he was real. Jim made him
real. I sometimes wondered whose head was stuffed with sponge
rubber.''
   Fred Rogers, host of ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' said,
``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands and
himself into them. ... His own playful spirit can't help but come
through.''
   Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' said Henson
``never talked down to children, he never degraded children, and
that's why his work was universally accepted.''
   Larry Harmon, better known as Bozo the Clown, said, ``His
passing is a tremendous blow to children of all ages around the
world.''
   Harmon's statement said Henson made his first TV appearance on a
Washington, D.C., production of Harmon's ``Bozo Show,'' whose host
was Willard Scott.
   ``We all knew from the very beginning that he was a true genius
and that God had given him a very special talent,'' said Scott, the
``Today'' show's weatherman.
   ``Jim was not simply the voice of Kermit,'' he added. ``Kermit
was the soul of Jim.''
