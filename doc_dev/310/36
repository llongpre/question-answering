The Saddest Muppet Show: Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Oscar the Grouch went to St. 
Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday for a memorial service for Muppet creator 
Jim Henson, who died in May in New York. But Kermit the Frog, whose voice was 
that of the puppet master, was not there.

Instead, Big Bird, Henson's 7-foot-tall creation from "Sesame Street," walked 
past the choir in the 17th-Century cathedral and sang Kermit's theme song, 
"Bein' Green." He was followed by a recording of Henson singing Kermit's 
"Rainbow Connection."

Well-wishers were asked not to wear black to the service. Henson's family said 
the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for the puppeteer's 
life as a traditional memorial service. A death-bed message from Henson, read 
by his son Brian, urged people to be good to each other and enjoy life: "It 
feels strange writing this while I am alive, but it sure would be hard after I 
go." GREG BRAXTON
