   Kermit the Frog, the fuzzy green alter ego of
the late muppeteer Jim Henson, will live on with someone new
supplying his voice.
   Kermit will be among the characters appearing in ``The Muppets
Celebrate Jim Henson'' on CBS Nov. 21.
   The amiable amphibian has been a mainstay of the Muppets for 35
years. Henson, who directed his motions and supplied his voice,
died of pneumonia in May.
   ``When Jim was alive, he said if anything happened to him,
Kermit must go on right away,'' Henson's widow, Jane, told TV
Guide, the magazine reports in its Nov. 17 issue. ``Because of
Kermit's significant place, Jim had essentially chosen who he
thought could do it. But we don't want to say who it is before the
show.
   ``The performer needs time. Kermit won't come back so strong at
first. Then little by little, he will get his whole personality
back.''
   Young viewers ensured Kermit's return.
   ``We found the kids really wanted to keep Kermit going,'' said
Henson's daughter, Cheryl. ``It was a touchy thing. They were sorry
Jim had died and wanted to know if the Muppets could die.
   ``We thought that the Muppets were characters, not people, and
that it was much better to say that they don't die.''
