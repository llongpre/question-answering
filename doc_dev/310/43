THE LEGAL squabbling between Walt Disney and the makers of the Muppets ended
yesterday when both sides 'amicably resolved' their differences and reached
an out-of-court settlement which will allow Disney to exhibit two Muppet
attractions at its Orlando, Florida theme park.
The altercation started nearly two weeks ago when Henson Associates, a
family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit accusing
Disney of violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets.
A Disney spokesman expressed deep regret for what was described as a serious
misunderstanding, and apologised to the Henson family and their company for
any harm that may have been caused.
Mr Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson and president of Henson
Associates, said that they had granted Walt Disney a licence for the Walt
Disney World resort in Florida.
The licence is for an initial term of 18 months, and contains an option for
an extension by another 3 1/2 years. Disney will have exclusive rights to
the attractions and to the Muppets appearing in them.
