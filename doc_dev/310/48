   In the beginning there was Joan Ganz Cooney and
a secretary. Then came Big Bird, Bert and Ernie, the Cookie Monster
and more. They still ask if you can tell them, please, how to get
to ``Sesame Street.''
   Millions of kids _ many of whom now are adults _ know the way
well. The series starts its 21st year today on public TV, having
grown to a staff of 92, including 10 actors and 13 Muppet players.
   For some time now, its audience has been more than American. Its
English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries, and it
has 15 international co-productions, its makers say.
   But it's still aimed at kids aged 1 through 5, particularly
those of poor, inner-city families. And the goal of the one-hour
series is the same now as in 1969: To teach as well as entertain.
   Now costing $12 million annually to make, 80 per cent of that
from commercial licensing of its characters and 20 per cent from
PBS stations, according to its makers, it began with definite
marching orders.
   ``I said, `Let's do a kind of ``Laugh-In'' for kids,' '' recalls
Cooney, the founder and since 1988 chairwoman of the Children's
Television Workshop, maker of ``Sesame Street'' and subsequent
teach-the-tykes shows.
   Her walk to ``Sesame Street'' began when she was a TV consultant
for the Carnegie Corporation, a foundation she joined after writing
a study called ``The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool
Education.''
   When she left to start the show, she told its producers it
should have animation, puppets, a studio, ``and let's not have a
single host. Let's have at least four hosts who will be men, women,
black, white, Hispanic, and so on.''
   Having decreed a pre-Jesse Jackson Rainbow Coalition, she also
wanted each show periodically ``interrupted by `non-commercials' to
teach letters and numbers,'' the basic-education snippets that
still air on the show.
   And the installation of Jim Henson's Muppets, ``was a very
critical decision'' in the show's success, says Cooney, a former
reporter from Phoenix, Ariz., who also has been an NBC publicist
and public TV documentary maker.
   (Interestingly, Henson's Kermit the Frog, never was a regular.
He only was a guest visitor, a CTW spokeswoman says, and he still
hops in now and then.)
   There have been some additions and changes, the biggest of the
latter the expanded range of what Cooney calls ``curriculum aims.''
   Among other things, today's ``Street'' watchers get a taste of
math and science.
   And, Cooney says, they also see teen-agers, a student from
Japan, and people with various disabilities, from Down's syndrome
to hearing and vision problems. There also are segments on emotions.
   ``We've dealt with death, with love and marriage, with pregnancy
and childbirth, with adoption, with anger,'' she says. ``We also
have a goal of teaching children to cooperate ... we consciously
model the acceptance of all people, of treating people kindly.''
   Like Oscar the Grouch, Cooney can get a tad testy, but mainly at
those who say the fast pace of ``Sesame Street'' has led to the MTV
Generation of short attention spans. A bum rap, she submits.
   ``Street'' has longer pieces now, she says, with virtually every
show given a ``plotted story line all the way through'' that is
interrupted only for the educational ``non-commercials.''
   ``We didn't make MTV possible,'' she says. She thought she had
made it clear in many speeches, she adds, that ``we followed
`Laugh-In.' We followed the revolution of TV. We did not create the
revolution in television.''
   A recent development _ the Cable Monster _ and such
child-getting cable channels as Nickelodeon and its ``Bugs Bunny''
and ``Road Runner'' reruns have had an impact on the ``Street''
audience, but only in the afternoon, she says.
   ``Our `Sesame Street' morning audience is not affected, and
that's always been our biggest audience,'' she says. Not so in the
afternoon, when the pre-schoolers' older brothers and sisters come
home from school.
   They tend to take over the set. With cable added to their
viewing choices, the competition is strong, not only against
``Street'' but also CTW's older-kids math show, ``Square One TV''
and its science show, ``3-2-1 Contact.''
   As it starts this season,``Street'' will portray more
teen-agers, and have two new topics _ the environment and
geography. The latter, she says, is because ``we know our children
are not learning geography.''
   The former, already a semiregular story on network newscasts, is
joining the ``Street,'' Cooney says, because ``we feel that for
their survival, the children had better learn about the
environment.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   THE FUTURE BE WITH YOU _ NBC's ``Today'' last week began a new
Friday segment called ``Countdown to the '90s.'' Today, both the
``CBS Morning News'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' join the
futures movement.
   CBS' show offers a week's worth called ``The 90s: Into the
Future.'' ABC's show has ``Ninetysomething: The Next 10 Years,''
but only will go futuring through Wednesday.
