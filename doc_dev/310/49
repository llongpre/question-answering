<LEADPARA>  Kermit the Frog and his cohorts will be goofing around at Disney World with
their owner's blessing this summer under an agreement between the producers of
some of the world's most recognized animated characters. The amicable
settlement ends a dispute between Muppet owner Henson Associates Inc. and Walt
Disney Co. The deal allows Disney to use the Muppet characters in the shows at
the Orlando, Fla., park until November 1992. Disney can renew the agreement
for 3 1/2 more years. Neither side would disclose how much Disney paid for the
rights.  </LEADPARA>
