"Big Bird's Sesame Street Story" looks like a little bit of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A ramp, bordered by glittering lights, juts into the floor of the arenas where 
the touring extravaganza is staged (at the Sports Arena through Sunday, then on 
to Long Beach and Anaheim Convention Centers). The proscenium of the stage 
proper is ablaze with light. Before the acts begin, colored lights swoop around 
the hall, heralding the arrival of the Sesame Street denizens. 
</P>
<P>
It's exciting, as Las Vegas is, but it's awfully grandiose for these unassuming 
characters. And the story line is even more narcissistic: a look at how "Sesame 
Street" got to be a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a factual story; no one mentions Muppets creator Jim Henson. But its 
explanation of how everyone had to be convinced that kids would want to learn 
something from TV, as well as be entertained, is ridiculously self-promotional. 
Have writers Jon Stone and Joseph A. Bailey run out of story ideas that would 
more directly relate to the real concerns of preschoolers? 
</P>
<P>
Many of the kids pay no attention to the story. But they do respond with shouts 
and stares to the sight of life-sized Muppets (notably excepting Kermit the 
Frog, who is nowhere to be seen) dancing, skating, singing, even bathing. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there are so many souvenirs to buy and play with. The most 
distracting of these are annoying $4 flashlights. A couple of children near me 
waved these at each other throughout the second act, oblivious to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sports Arena today at noon and 3:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5 p.m. At 
Long Beach Convention Center Wednesday through May 28. At Anaheim Convention 
Center May 31-June 4. Tickets: $8-$10.50; (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.
