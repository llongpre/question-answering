   Jim Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, Miss
Piggy and the other Muppet characters, died today at a hospital. He
was 53.
   Henson died at 1:30 a.m. from a massive bacterial infection,
Kathleen Robinson, a spokeswoman at New York Hospital, said. Henson
was admitted to the hospital Tuesday, she said. Hospital officials
would say nothing else this morning.
   Friends praised Henson's humanity and his abilities to educate
and entertain children.
   ``He could make you laugh while you're crying,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television in Cambridge,
Mass.
   ``I never met a kindler, gentler wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for Walt Disney Co. Henson's puppets grew into an industry, much of
which was purchased by Disney for a reported price of $100 million
to $150 million.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world. He was a giant in the entertainment industry,'' Okun
said.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954 and they debuted on a local
Washington, D.C., television program ``Sam and Friends,'' which won
a local Emmy in 1959.
   During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe appeared regularly on
``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' But Henson's
biggest break came when his characters appeared on the public
television hit ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Henson was the voice of Kermit, one of the most popular of his
creations. His work with the Muppets earned him a variety of
awards, from a Peabody award for excellence in television
programming to a Grammy for a Muppet album.
   Henson's other creations included The Cookie Monster, Oscar the
Grouch and Miss Piggy. Henson's shop brought the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles to the screen, where they became the nation's
top-grossing movie.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' regular, said, ``Not only was
Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   Henson's sudden death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street''
in the last year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the
popular children's series, died last year at age 52. A tribute to
Raposo was scheduled to air tonight. Former cast member Northern
Calloway also died recently.
   Millions of children have grown up with ``Sesame Street,'' which
is seen in more than 80 countries. It has 15 international
co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English. The program initially was intended to assist inner-city
children, but its popularity far transcended that.
   Henson produced ``The Muppet Show,'' which was broadcast from
1975 through 1981. It became the most widely seen television
program in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries.
   A Saturday morning cartoon, ``The Muppet Babies,'' is currently
airing.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936. He
married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five children.
   The family said plans for a memorial service would be announced
later.
