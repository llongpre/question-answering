MUPPETS MAINTAIN HUGGABILITY IN 'JIM HENSON HOUR'

Some of television's oldest stars -- the Muppets -- are still among the 
freshest. 
</P>
<P>
That applies to the "Sesame Street" creatures on PBS, "Jim Henson's Muppet 
Babies" on CBS and now also to "The Jim Henson Hour," one of the new Friday 
night entries on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Its premiere -- at 8 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39 -- is a happy, 
imaginative, cleverly written, fur-flying romp. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Muppeteering yields entertainment on two levels: visual for the young 
and satirical for adults. The program's magazine segment includes that fabulous 
singing group, The Extremes; a visit with a somewhat bizarre-looking candidate 
in the Miss Galaxy pageant ("I want to work with underprivileged children -- 
and eat them!") and a splendid production of "My Dinner With Godzilla" starring 
comedian Louie Anderson and Godzilla itself. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, the bill arrives. Louie to Godzilla: "Let's see, you had Tokyo, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
Another regular segment is that old favorite, "The Storyteller," tonight 
featuring John Hurt as the medieval spinner of tales. Written by Anthony 
Minghella, the delightful opening story is about a giant who has no heart. But 
how many do? 
</P>
<P>
"The Jim Henson Hour" has old Muppets and new Muppets, all of them goofy, all 
of them huggable, all of them a bright addition to prime time. HOWARD ROSENBERG
