<LEADPARA>  News item: A federal lawsuit filed by Henson Associates Inc., charges that the
Walt Disney Co. has used images of the Muppets without a license.;     'BACK
in '52, we tried a frog," Mouse says and erupts into a fit of wracking coughs.
He thumps his sternum with a white-gloved hand and comments, "Waaaagh! Too
many cigars."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  McEnroe is a columnist for the Hartford, Conn., Courant.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His little black eyes dart around my office, taking in the waterfall, the
small volcano, the authentic ocelot habitat.;    "Izzat real lava?" he says.
"Very class. Some guys got a lava lamp, you got a stinkin' volcano. I like
that in a lawyer. I been in Mike Ovitz's office. He don't got a volcano.";   
"We need to stay on the ball here. Now, when the Henson people depose you . .
.";    "Like I said, we had a frog. Harry the Frog. Billy the Frog. Who
remembers? He wasn't funny. I told the Old Man that, going in. A frog is not
funny. That's basic show biz. No, no, says the Old Man, Billy the Frog, Dave
the Frog, with his eating the cockamamie flies and jumping around like a nut,
is going to be a big star.";    "We really have to move on here.";    "So, the
Old Man puts him in a short with Chip and Dale, who were gay by the way. Did
you know that? Gay, that's what it's called these days. The studio made a big
deal over Chip being very heavy with Arlene Dahl or Laraine Day or somebody, I
forget who. It was all a front. They were both feygele as the day is long.
Lovely, terrific guys. Collected majolica. They had some wonderful -- Waaaagh!
-- some wonderful stuff.";    "The Henson lawyers will probably say . . .";   
"So they shoot the short that was kind of based on . . . Whattheheck was it?
Goof, what was the . . . Goof! Goof!";    Goofy has dozed off in the chair
next to him. He perks up as his name is shouted.;    "Can you spare us a
little time from your duties in the ionosphere?" Mouse inquires. "We're only
being sued for our undershorts by a bunch of paskudna pigs and chickens. You
could pay some attention. What was the film with Wayne and Milland and the
cockamamie squid?";    " 'Reap the Wild Wind,' " Goofy says and immediately
falls back asleep.;    "I know what you're thinking," Mouse says. "Not exactly
Brookings Institute material, right? It's true: he took maybe two, three too
many frying pans to the coco in his heyday, but this fella here could do
comedy! Real comedy, not a bunch of -- Waaagh! -- pigs in a meshugge space
ship. He gave his life to the industry, and the Old Man paid him bupkes. But
that's another story.";    "If we could get back to . . .";    "Anyway, comes
opening night, Al the Frog is there, I think Ann Sheridan was his date. The
lights go down, the short comes on, nobody laughs, the critics hate it, you
know the rest. I found Dale in the men's room throwing up acorns. He was a
wreck: 'Ooh, aah, we'll never work again.' I says, 'Talk slower; I'm a mouse.'
That gets him laughing a little. I tell him: 'Dry your eyes. Yes, the short is
a flop. So? Life goes on. Get rid of the frog, and you'll own this town by
October.' Was I wrong?";    "No, you were . . .";    "And here's my point.
This frog, who last I knew was working little kids' birthday parties, this
frog was funnier than Kevin the Frog, this puppet we supposedly cannot live
without so bad we have to get sued by some shnorrer company.";    "Kermit.";  
 "Kevin, Kermit -- the point is, he's only a puppet. A hand puppet. He's moth
food, you should excuse my frankness. They say we needed cloth pigs and frogs?
We already had the biggest puppet in show business. Who was bigger than
Pinocchio? The guy is synonymous with puppet. Look it up.";    "So you would
contend that it was strictly as a favor to the Muppets that . . .";    "There
you go. That's the kind of thinking got you a volcano in your office. Of
course, Pinocchio was not a nice guy. Did you know that? Not many people do.
He got rid of the strings, suddenly he was Godzilla around the lot. I remember
one day I was -- Waaagh! -- having lunch with Joan Blondell in the commissary
and in comes Pinocchio and . . ."  </TEXT>
