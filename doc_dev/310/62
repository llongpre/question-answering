   Puppeteer Jim Henson talked to his cousin,
a doctor, but seemed to have only a cold and did not have an actual
medical exam during a visit to North Carolina the weekend before he
died, his mother says.
   The 53-year-old Henson, the creator of the Muppets, died of
complications from pneumonia in New York on Wednesday, three days
after returning from a Mother's Day trip to Ahoskie. A memorial
service was set for Monday. Henson had requested that no one wear
black.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, director of intensive care at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York, had said that Henson
saw a doctor over the weekend in North Carolina but there was no
sign of pneumonia.
   The doctor was Henson's cousin. But Henson's mother, Barbara
Henson, said Thursday that the cousin did not examine her son. She
declined to give his name.
   ``Jim saw his cousin in the car, if you call that seeing a
doctor,'' Mrs. Henson said.
   ``He does not treat our family,'' she said. ``He did not examine
Jim. He merely picked him up at a motel and brought him to my house
for lunch.''
   She said the media ``are trying to make a problem, and there
isn't one.''
   Gelmont agreed that any implication that someone in North
Carolina failed to treat Henson properly is wrong. In North
Carolina, Gelmont said, Henson's only symptom was a mild cough.
   ``No yokel doctor did anything wrong down there,'' Gelmont said.
   When Henson arrived Saturday, his family thought he had a cold.
   ``He was a little sniffly,'' his mother told The Charlotte
Observer. ``It was a nice day. We just played croquet.''
   Because he felt worse Sunday, she said, he slept late at his
motel, didn't eat anything for lunch, and decided to take an
earlier flight home. She said the cousin advised him to see a
physician once he got back to New York.
   Streptococcus pneumonia group A _ the form of bacterial
pneumonia that attacked Henson's lungs and other organs _ spreads
unusually fast. It wasn't until Monday, Gelmont said, that Henson
noticed blood in his phlegm. By 5 a.m. Tuesday, when he arrived at
the emergency room, he had trouble breathing.
   Lisa Simon, who produces ``Sesame Street,'' said no decision has
been made whether Henson's death would be explained to children who
watch the show, or what would become of the characters for whom
Henson did the voices, including Kermit the frog and Ernie.
   ``We're just dealing with shock of Jim's death,'' Ms. Simon said.
   The show won't resume production until September for the 22nd
season, which begins airing in January 1991.
   The time from now until September ``gives us the opportunity to
catch our breath and see where we're going to go from here,'' said
Simon. ``There are a lot of characters on the show other than Jim's
characters.''
   Will Lee, an actor who played kindly shopkeeper Mr. Hooper on
the program, died in December 1982 at the age of 74. Nearly a year
later, young viewers were told about Mr. Hooper's death. They got
the news on the Thanksgiving program, chosen because parents were
likely to be with their children then to answer questions.
   A memorial service was scheduled for noon Monday at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, said Susan Berry, a
spokeswoman for Jim Henson Productions.
