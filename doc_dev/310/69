<LEADPARA>  The Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates today reached an out-of-court
agreement that allows Disney to open two Muppet shows at Walt Disney World in
Orlando, Fla. The amicable resolution puts to rest a sensational federal court
dispute that had pitted the producer of Mickey Mouse against the owner of
Kermit the Frog.;    The two sides dismissed their lawsuits against each other
and agreed to an 18-month license that can be extended for another 3 1/2
years. Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Disney called the
legal fight the result of a "serious misunderstanding," and apologized. A
trial in Henson's copyright-infringement lawsuit filed against Disney earlier
this month in federal court was set to begin May 13.  </LEADPARA>
