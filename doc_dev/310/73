Disney to Move Forward With Henson Deal: Despite the unexpected death of 
Muppets creator Jim Henson, Walt Disney Co. plans to go through with its 
pending purchase of Henson Associates Inc. "I don't see any reason why the sale 
won't go through," Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said Monday.

"It will be temporarily delayed to allow for an appropriate mourning period." 
Okun did not disclose when the deal is scheduled to be completed. Henson, who 
died at age 53 last Wednesday of bacterial pneumonia, was buried Monday in New 
York. GREG BRAXTON
