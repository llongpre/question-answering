   Why is Mickey Mouse so short? Why doesn't
Disney hire kids to help develop projects? Isn't Chairman Michael
Eisner offended by Bette Midler's foul mouth?
   Of every five Disney stockholders, four own fewer than 100
shares. About half have 10 or fewer. Many own a single share, and
proudly possess certificates bearing the likeness of the world's
most famous rodent to prove it.
   And as they did this past week, thousand upon thousands throng
to the Disney shareholders' meeting each year with attitudes so
protective, they might be worrying over a favorite restaurant
changing its menu rather than an entertainment colossus that turned
a $703 million profit last year.
   A young boy timidly addressed the question about Mickey's
stature to Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and President Frank Wells
at Tuesday's annual meeting, held in the cavernous Anaheim
Convention across from Disneyland.
   Eisner cupped his ear, then glanced at Wells as the boy repeated
his question into a microphone.
   ``He says, `Why is Mickey Mouse so short?''' Wells said, peering
across the huge podium at Eisner as 9,000 shareholders looked on.
   Eisner shrugged and smiled. ``Well, he's a mouse!''
   Why don't kids help develop projects? Wells doesn't miss studio attraction
in California like
the one Disney has opened to crushing crowds in Florida (forget it
_ but check out Hollywoodland, coming to you at Disneyland in 1996).
   The vast majority of Disney shares, of course, are held by
bigtime private and institutional investors, most notably Texas'
Bass brothers, concerned with the bottom line that Wells and Eisner
have nurtured so well since they were brought in to run the company
in 1984. (The share price is about eight times higher than then,
after adjusting for stock splits).
   But meeting-goers are more likely to worry whether the company,
in its quest to conquer the worlds of entertainment and leisure,
has betrayed the G-rated, young-at-heart, Magic Kingdom legacy left
by affable old Uncle Walt.
   Particularly worrisome to many shareholders were four-letter
words in movies from Disney's Touchstone studio, with Miss Midler,
who has a multipicture deal with the studio, singled out by name
repeatedly.
   There were many other concerns: if the upcoming ``Dick Tracy''
with Warren Beatty and Madonna would be a bloodfest (it's less
violent than you'd believe from the trailer, Eisner said); if
painting crews visible during day hours at theme parks might cost
Disney its ``razor's edge'' at the parks; if Disney is ruining
morale by underpaying workers.
   Eisner and Wells dodged the bombs with aplomb, for the most
part, and with a lot of help from mega-screen video appearances by
Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy (Disney bought Muppets rights last
year), and naturally Mickey himself.
   Free passes to Disneyland didn't hurt, of course.
   And, thank Mary Poppins, no one brought up that nasty PR mess
about the officer on the Queen Mary refusing to shave his mustache
to conform to Disney's tight-ship dictums (Disney bought the Queen
Mary along with the Spruce Goose and the Disneyland Hotel from the
Wrather Corp.).
   But Eisner and Wells will need all the pixie dust they can get
in the future. Just wait till word filters down that the head of
Disney's start-up record label, Hollywood Records, is the attorney
for _ hide your ears, Minnie _ Guns 'N Roses, the current
foul-mouthed champions of bad-boy rock.
