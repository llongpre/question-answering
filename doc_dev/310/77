   Fran Allison, the warmhearted foil for two
goofy puppets in TV's ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' show and pioneer for
some of today's most popular children's programs, has died at the
age of 81.
   Death was blamed on bone marrow failure, an inability to produce
sufficient numbers of white and red blood cells, said Sherman Oaks
Community Hospital spokeswoman Johna Rogovin.
   ``Fran was a bridge character between the audience and the puppet
characters,'' Muppets creator Jim Henson said of Miss Allison, who
died Tuesday.
   ``You have a person who takes those characters as real, and that
helps make the characters more believable,'' said Henson, who called
the ``Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie'' show ``my major influence in terms of
puppetry.''
   ``We have continued to use that technique,'' Henson said of the
realism Miss Allison brought to the show.
   She worked as a singer and radio personality in shows originating
from Chicago during the 1930s and '40s, and was well known for her
role as the gossipy Aunt Fanny on ``Don McNeill's Breakfast Club.''
   The actress joined Burr Tillstrom's popular puppet show,
originally known as ``Junior Jamboree,'' when it began on local
television in Chicago in 1947.
   ``It was a delight working with him from the very first moment,''
Miss Allison recalled after Tillstrom died in 1985.
   The program, featuring Tillstrom's ``Kuklapolitan Players,''
emerged from the early age of television to become one of TV's
longest-running children's programs.
   ``Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie'' ran nationally from 1948 to 1957 and
later appeared on public television and in syndication during the
1960s and '70s, going off the air for good in 1976.
   Miss Allison co-starred with a bald, gentle clown named Kukla and
an exuberant bucktoothed serpent, Oliver J. Dragon.
   She essentially played herself, a Chicago singer and actress who
appeared in front of the puppet stage, and whose concern, joy and
infinite patience for her co-stars enthralled millions of young
viewers.
   ``She was so honest, I think that was what made it work so
well,'' said Jon Stone, a ``Sesame Street'' creator and producer at
the Children's Television Workshop. ``She took the puppets at face
value.''
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said she is beginning a June 20 seminar on children's television at
the Museum of Broadcasting in New York with clips from the show.
   ``I am using it as an example of the concern that the broadcast
industry used to have for children and their families,'' Ms. Charren
said. ``It was one of those wonderful ideas that happens rarely,
when something that appeals to children also appeals to adults.''
   Miss Allison was born in LaPorte City, Iowa, in 1907, said her
niece, Nan Calvin.
   She is survived by her brother, Lynn Allison. Her husband of 35
years, Archie Levington, died in 1978.
   A memorial is scheduled Saturday in suburban Sherman Oaks with
burial to follow in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Ms. Calvin said.
