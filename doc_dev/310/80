<HEAD>Hammer, Henson Provide a Lesson in Value of Human Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. without Armand Hammer
becomes a takeover target. Henson Associates Inc. without Muppet
creator Jim Henson loses its appeal to Walt Disney Co.
   The lessons of the past week clearly demonstrate the value of
human assets in American business.
   On Tuesday, shares of Occidental leaped 9 percent as investors
began to speculate on the corporation's life after Hammer's death
at age 92. For years, conventional wisdom held that the company
would restructure or be acquired once Hammer departed.
   Hammer dominated the company and built it into the nation's 16th
largest corporation. Along the way, the company racked up big debts
and paid out healthy dividends to shareholders as it acquired
interests in a variety of businesses including energy, chemicals
and meat packing.
   Without its strong-willed chief, the company could narrow its
focus, lower its debts, cut the dividend, or be acquired in whole
or in part.
   Investors who snapped up the stock after Hammer died were
betting on a profit down the road from whatever fate awaited the
company. Contrarians, however, believed the opposite, seeing a soft
market for takeovers and a minefield of problems for Occidental's
new leadership.
   Whatever the hypothesis, the loss of Hammer was central to the
calculations.
   The collapse of the deal between Disney and Henson was similarly
rooted in a valuation of the late Henson's own talent and
influence.
   When Disney and Henson announced an agreement in principle for
the two creative empires to merge 18 months ago, Disney was
figuring Henson himself into the mix as much as Kermit the Frog and
Miss Piggy.
   When Henson died unexpectedly in May, the proposed combination
lost some luster.
   Henson's estate kept pushing for top dollar, but minus the
puppeteer himself, Disney balked at a price tag estimated at $150
million.
   Corporations have what's called a ``book value,'' commonly
described as the value of assets on the books, less liabilities.
Not included in that definition is the asset value - or liability -
of a company's leadership.
   Individuals, especially those with larger-than-life
personalities, can add to either side of the balance sheet.

<HEAD>RETAIL SALES: The News Is Still Bad, But Improving</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With 10 days to go until Christmas, the news was still bad, but
getting better, for the nation's retailers.
   Figures from the government showed total retail sales were off
0.1 percent last month. Excluding automobiles, sales inched up 0.2
percent.
   That's not great by any means, but it was a better report card
for the retailers than most experts had expected.
   Anecdotal evidence showed business picking up around the
country. Storeowners said traffic was up, and manufacturers
supplying merchandise to stores were filling more orders.
   The industry was hoping to make up ground in the final days, but
worries about the economy were still scaring off some consumers. A
poll released by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News said nearly
half of those surveyed planned to spend less this Christmas. Only
one in 10 said they would spend more.

<HEAD>OIL: Still Waiting for Gulf Solution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Uncertainty also continued to plague the oil world. OPEC agreed
at its winter strategy meeting in Vienna, Austria, to keep pumping
oil in excess of established quotas, at least until the Persian
Gulf crisis is resolved.
   Ignoring the quotas could lead to an eventual glut of oil, but
the money has been too good to pass up during the crisis.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries did get assurances from super-producer Saudi Arabia and
others to trim production once the crisis ends.
   Market traders of oil were likewise on the fence. Oil touched
lows at midweek not seen since the early days of the crisis, but
rose again at week's end over worries that diplomatic efforts aimed
at ending the crisis were faltering. At $26.50-$27 per barrel, the
price of crude still had a $5 ``war premium'' built in.
   A government report said energy prices on the wholesale level
moderated during November, but inflation was still percolating at a
6.9 percent annual rate, up from 4.9 percent last year.

<HEAD>DEALS: NCR Rejects AT&amp;T; Kerkorian Likes Chrysler</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On the dealmaking front, the board of computer maker NCR Corp.
unanimously rejected American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
$90-a-share cash tender offer, calling the bid ``grossly inadequate
and unfair.''
   The move by AT&amp;T turned hostile after friendly discussions broke
down a week ago. AT&amp;T, meanwhile, lined up all the banking support
it needed to finance the $6.1 billion takeover.
   Chrysler Corp. said California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian had
acquired more than 9 percent of its outstanding stock, prompting
the automaker to bolster its antitakeover defenses.
   Kerkorian has built a fortune in the entertainment industry and
is known for other takeover forays.

<HEAD>MEDIA: Bad Times Cause CBS Move, Lower Earnings Projections</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. announced a $2 billion plan to buy back stock from
shareholders to bolster confidence in the company. The stock has
sagged in recent weeks under the weight of its own dour earnings
projections, heavy spending on sports programming and a soft
advertising environment.
   Other media companies represented at an industry conference in
New York spent the week comparing notes on the disappointing year
ahead. Among the giants forecasting hard times through 1991 were
Gannett Co. Inc., The New York Times Co., and Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   The ad slump was mostly to blame, and by one forecast shared at
the conference, ad spending may only grow 4.6 percent next year,
the slowest pace in two decades.

<HEAD>AUTO SALES: Good Report But Gloomy Predictions</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's automakers reported a 22.3 percent increase in car
and light truck sales during the first 10 days of December, but
industry executives offered dark predictions for 1991.
   Sales could drop from about 14 million to 13.5 million vehicles
next year, the lowest total since 1983, when the industry was
emerging from the last recession.
   Adding to the gloom for American companies was the introduction
of a new Honda station wagon to be produced at the Japanese
company's plant in central Ohio. The new entry adds a station wagon
version to the Accord line, already the hottest selling car in
America.

<HEAD>THRIFTS: Losses Double in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Despite efforts to shut down failed thrifts, losses at surviving
S&amp;Ls more than doubled in the July-September quarter, the
government said.
   Thrifts lost $631 million in the third quarter, compared with a
revised $302 million in the second quarter and $373 million in the
first. The flood of red ink was blamed on the real estate slump.
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of California launched an
effort to recoup some of its losses, suing Michael Milken and
others tied to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Columbia said it was enticed into bad junk-bond deals by Milken,
the convicted financier, and other Drexel officials.
