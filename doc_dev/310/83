   Well-wishers were asked not to wear black at a
memorial service Monday for Muppets creator Jim Henson at London's
St. Paul's Cathedral.
   Henson's family requested the ban, saying the event would be as
much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson's life as a
traditional memorial service.
   Henson died in New York on May 16 after a bout with pneumonia.
He was 53.
   He came to Britain in 1976 to make The Muppet Show, which became
one of the most widely seen television programs in the world with
an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 countries.
