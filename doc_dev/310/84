   He may not be as famous as Jim Henson, but
in his own way, Frank Ballard has done as much to advance the art
of puppetry in the United States as the man who brought us Kermit
the Frog and Miss Piggy.
   For 23 years, Ballard has directed the puppetry program at the
University of Connecticut, the first school in the United States to
offer a bachelor of fine arts degree in puppetry and the only one
with bachelor's and master's programs still in existence.
   In a series of basement rooms overrun by scraps of cloth,
woodworking tools, sewing machines and an endless supply of
puppets, Ballard has taught students how to design and make
marionettes, hand puppets and stick puppets. He shows them how to
operate the dolls, write scripts and stage large-scale puppet
productions.
   Ballard's students have gone on to work for Henson on various
Muppets projects, movie production companies in Hollywood and their
own traveling tours. One former student is a psychologist, using
puppetry in therapy, and another designs toys for Fisher Price.
   ``I guess I've worked all my life trying to upgrade the
standards of puppetry,'' said Ballard, 60, who plans to stop
teaching this year and devote his time to creating a museum for the
thousands of puppets he and his students have created, from tiny
hand puppets wearing intricate clothing to larger-than-life
monsters with wagging tongues and rolling eyeballs.
   ``I'd like to ... see the art respected and accepted as a true
art form rather than kiddies' play.
   ``To do that, part of it is the responsibility of the
puppeteers, who have to upgrade the quality of their work. Part of
the problem is there's no formal training in puppetry.''
   In Europe and Asia, puppetry has a strong tradition, with
countries in Eastern Europe offering subsidized puppetry training
to students and then often providing them with jobs.
   Puppetry doesn't enjoy such status in the United States, where
puppets are generally thought of as the cute and cuddly domain of
children. Several of Ballard's students say they had trouble
convincing their parents that it was worth spending four years in
college for a puppetry degree.
   Ballard has worked to change that image, through his classes and
the grandiose, adult productions his students have staged, such as
``Macbeth,'' ``Peer Gynt,'' ``The Fantasticks'' and ``H.M.S.
Pinafore.''
   ``We do large productions here because nobody else can _ to give
as many students an opportunity to work in productions as possible
and to teach the audience, because the preconceived notion of what
a puppet is so squared in,'' Ballard said, sitting with five
students at a table covered with glue droppings, saw dust and
puppet eyes.
   In the world of puppetry, Ballard and his program are well
known. His students have performed a puppet opera at the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and Ballard has
addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
   Ballard has served as president of the Puppeteers of America and
L'Union Internationale de la Marionette. He has been honored by the
New England Theatre Conference and by the Connecticut Commission on
the Arts. Last year, President Bush saluted Ballard in a letter,
praising him for his contribution to the arts.
   Perhaps the best testament to Ballard's fame came a few years
ago when one of his students was traveling in the Soviet Union,
where puppeteering enjoys great popularity.
   The student was pulled aside and interrogated by police, who
wanted to know what he was doing in the Soviet Union. All the
student had to do was mention Frank Ballard and the University of
Connecticut, and he was immediately released by some very impressed
and friendly Soviet security agents.
   Ballard's love for the craft began when he attended a puppet
show at age 5. He received a puppet for his birthday and began
staging his own shows, eventually putting himself through college.
He came to UConn in 1956 to teach in the Dramatic Arts Department.
Within a few years, he was teaching puppetry, and in 1966 began
offering bachelor's degrees.
   The University of California at Los Angeles and the University
of Hawaii eventually began puppetry programs, but both have since
folded.
   Ballard is not giving up the helm of UConn's puppetry program
because he wants to, but because his health requires it. He has
Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological disorder that
causes tremors and muscular rigidity.
   ``I can't manipulate my hands anymore and I can't perform,'' he
said. ``It gets harder. I'd rather stop now than be carried out.''
   Technically, Ballard retired last fall, but he continued to
teach this year because he didn't want to see the puppetry program
end while the school searched for his replacement.
   For Rolande Duprey, one of two graduate students in the program,
ending the puppetry program would have been a disaster.
   Starting last spring, Duprey began preparing for a performance
she finally staged a few weeks ago. First, she chose a 15th-century
French farce called ``Pierre Pathelin.'' Then she translated it
into English, and rewrote it in verse, adding a few more characters
and deleting some of the monologue to make it more appropriate for
a puppet show.
   Last summer, she began molding heads for the main characters.
Then she began making bodies and stitching costumes and a curtain.
She also trained puppeteers, some of whom were newcomers.
   ``You have to do it because you love it, something like this
which can be so difficult, so demanding _ you have to love it,''
Duprey said, showing off one of her lifesize _ and lifelike _
creations, an old man hand-and-stick puppet whose haughty eyelids
open and close and jowls droop to perfection.
   Sandy Bellock, a UConn senior and puppetry major, agreed that
the puppetry program was demanding because it requires students to
design, create, act and write, but that's why she likes it.
   ``All my life I've been interested in the arts as a whole _
dance, acting, music _ and I discovered puppetry was an art form
that would allow me to combine my interests,'' she said.
   ``Plus I like the idea of creating a whole reality. Instead of
just casting a bunch of characters, you get to create characters. I
call it the God complex.''
