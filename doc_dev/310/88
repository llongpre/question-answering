   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner
on Tuesday labeled reports of a possible merger with broadcasting
giant CBS Inc. as rumors.
   But asked about the possibility of a merger by one of 9,000
Disney shareholders at Disney's annual meeting, Eisner added:
``That is not to say we wouldn't talk to them, haven't talked to
them.''
   The shareholder cited repeated reports in business and
entertainment trade publications of a possible takeover of CBS by
cash-rich Disney, which is rapidly expanding its entertainment,
theme parks resorts and consumer products businesses.
   Disney earned $703 million in fiscal 1989, 35 percent more than
in 1988.
   ``We don't comment on any rumors,'' Eisner said at the meeting,
held at a convention center near Disneyland. Acknowledging the
persistence of the reports, he added: ``If we did comment, we would
have to comment every day on ridiculous rumors.''
   Eisner and Disney President Frank Wells were brought in to run
Disney at the end of 1984, and since then the company has boomed,
with sharply higher revenues, expansions of moviemaking and theme
parks and the decision last year to start a record label.
   The executives reviewed Disney's overlapping plans to exploit
its trademark characters in theme parks, resorts, television,
movies, recordings and magazines.
   They showed off Italian-language Disney comics and planned
software to allow computer users to create their own Disney
animation; displayed a prototype of a planned Mickey Mouse magazine
in Russian and said Polish and Hungarian versions were being
developed; and described the promotional blitz of products that
will accompany Disney's ``Dick Tracy'' movie this summer.
   They also said Disney hopes to expand its stores from 41 now to
perhaps 200, with outlets in Tokyo and Paris; reviewed previously
announced plans to add new attractions to its theme parks and open
all-new parks in California, Japan and Florida; and said they would
court convention business with new hotels to help during slow
periods.
   Epitomizing how Disney is expanding and blending its franchises
was a tape of Miss Piggy _ Disney acquired rights to the Muppets
last year _ singing ``Some Day My Prince Will Come'' from
``Cinderella'' in French for a Christmas special on European
television.
   ``A great percentage of our growth potential lies outside our
borders,'' Wells said.
   The wholesome image nurtured by founder Walt Disney was foremost
in the minds of many shareholders, who peppered Eisner with
questions about concerns over movies for mature audiences put out
by Disney's Touchstone studio, soon to be joined by Hollywood
Pictures, a third Disney studio.
   Asked about the use of four-letter words in those pictures,
Eisner said, ``I'm no more pleased to see Bette Midler use an
expletive than to see my 16-year-old use an expletive.''
   But he said, ``Our movies tend to reflect society,'' adding that
Disney can never hope to attract top filmmakers if ``we become
censors.''
   Another shareholder asked whether Disney was worried about
losing the public's confidence by releasing ``crime terror and
violence such as `Dick Tracy' and `Cocktail,''' which starred Tom
Cruise.
   ``I believe there is a place for all kinds of movies if they are
correctly labeled,'' Eisner said. He said he thought viewers would
find ``Dick Tracy'' to be ``clearly a Disney film'' and less
violent than it appeared in the trailer.
   Separately, Disney said Tuesday it was increasing the company's
quarterly cash dividend from 12 cents per share to 14{ cents per
share. The dividend is payable May 15 to shareholders of record on
April 13.
