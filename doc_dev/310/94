   An ``Indiana Jones'' stunt attraction and
a 1930s-style Hollywood backlot attraction are among possibilities
for what may be Disneyland's biggest expansion in its 35-year
history, park employees said.
   Disney officials are keeping mum about specifics of the
expansion plans until an announcement Friday by Disney Chairman
Michael Eisner.
   The expansion is in ``keeping with Walt Disney's founding
philosophy that the park will never be completed as long as there
was imagination left in the world,'' Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth
told the Orange County Register in a report published Tuesday.
   ``It involves the next 10 years, but I can't tell you anymore,''
he said.
   But employees who last week were shown preliminary plans by
President Richard Nunis told the newspaper the park plans to build
two new theme areas _ Mickey's Birthday Land and a partial
reproduction of a Hollywood studio tour attraction at Walt Disney
World in Florida.
   Those plans also included a stunt attraction based on the
``Indiana Jones'' movies, and rides based on the animated movie
character Roger Rabbit and the Muppets, they said. Disney bought
the rights to the Muppet characters last year.
   ``They said none of this was guaranteed,'' Disney employee
Christy Bauer said. ``But I got the impression that it was probably
going to happen because everything was really detailed.''
   In their presentation to employees, Disneyland officials gave no
construction timetables or cost estimates.
   It would be the first major expansion since Bear Country, now
called Critter Country, was added in 1972. Disney has about 78
acres available for expansion in Anaheim, including about 30 acres
within the park.
