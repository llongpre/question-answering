Taking a look into tomorrowland, Walt Disney Co. said Friday it hopes to build 
a new $1-billion theme park in Southern California in the next decade and 
reinvigorate 35-year-old Disneyland with dozens of new attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new park will pit Anaheim and Long Beach against each other in a 
high-stakes game to become the Southland's premier tourist stop. But Disney 
officials warned that without government assistance to solve traffic problems, 
a new park would remain a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements at Disneyland, the nation's second most popular amusement park 
after Walt Disney World in Florida, will begin immediately and be phased in 
over the next 10 years. Company officials have described the costly expansion 
and remodeling as the largest in the park's 35-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the '90s -- the decade we reinvent the Disney experience not just in 
California, but worldwide," said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief 
executive, at a press conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner said the company's 10-year plan calls for the addition at the Magic 
Kingdom of a slew of rides based on hit movies -- including "The Little 
Mermaid," the "Indiana Jones" series, and the upcoming "Dick Tracy," giving 
Disneyland a glitzier, Hollywood flavor. 
</P>
<P>
He also detailed plans to add two new theme areas -- Mickey's Starland and 
Hollywoodland, a major new area of Disneyland that will be a fantasy 
re-creation of Hollywood Boulevard. The Tomorrowland section of the park also 
will be completely redone. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has been considering construction of a second amusement park in Southern 
California for at least four years. Eisner said Disney wants to build the new 
park in Anaheim near Disneyland or in Long Beach. But the project is contingent 
on government cooperation to resolve traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are enormous with the infrastructure -- in terms of traffic 
systems, exit roads, parking, the needed amount of land," Eisner said. "Without 
the interest of citizens, the city council and the mayor (of either city), it 
will never happen." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the press conference, Eisner said there would have to be 
some kind of governmental financial support "in things like infrastructure." He 
noted that in France and Florida the company has been able to win concessions 
on issues ranging from zoning to widening roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't build highways," Eisner said. "Unless we have a partnership," the 
project won't be built. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Anaheim or Long Beach wins the new attraction "depends a lot on which 
one wants us more," Eisner said. He estimated the cost of the new park could be 
well over $1 billion and said the company hopes to begin developing it by the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, a second park could be added on 40 acres already owned by the 
company near Disneyland. There are another 30 undeveloped acres within 
Disneyland in the so-called "backstage" areas. Eisner also said current parking 
lots might be used, if alternative parking space could be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Or we could use a combination of those areas," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter enthusiastically endorsed the proposal for a second 
theme park, and city officials there say they are prepared to arrange off-site 
parking and transportation to a new facility if that's what it would take to 
win the new park. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, meanwhile, Disney Co. officials met Thursday with city 
officials, showing them drawings and slides of a nautical-theme park. Disney 
now leases 55 acres -- where the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions are 
located -- and has an option to develop another 256 acres, now mostly under 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"It would obviously be ocean-oriented and an educational type attraction with a 
nautical and water theme," said Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell. "We're excited 
about the possibility, as long as the traffic and financial implications are 
attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eisner was cautious in emphasizing that the second theme park is 
desirable from the company's standpoint but far from definite. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can solve the problems in California, the state as a Disney 
destination is going to become less important as Florida becomes more 
important," he said, referring to Disney's hugely successful 30,000-acre Walt 
Disney World in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, almost two years ago, Disney scuttled plans to build a $611-million 
theme park and shopping mall in downtown Burbank -- after 15 years and endless 
discussions with city officials there -- when it determined estimated revenue 
would not support the project. 
</P>
<P>
Far more definite than a second Southland theme park are the company's plans to 
spruce up and expand Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Eisner said, the Muppets will invade Disneyland with a Muppets stage 
show. The park also will add a Young Indiana Jones ride, similar to one in 
Florida in which the movie hero survives flipped jeeps, flash fires and rolling 
boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, in 1993, Mickey's Starland is scheduled to open, coinciding 
with the corporate mascot's 65th birthday. The new theme area will feature a 
birthday party show, a chance for customers to shake Mickey's hand, plus a 
Muppet Movie in "Muppetvision 3-D." A "Little Mermaid" attraction based on the 
hit film also will be added. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrowland -- with its outdated Mission to Mars ride -- will be completely 
refurbished in 1994. While turnstiles will continue to click at the most 
popular attractions -- Star Tours and Space Mountain -- new rides will include 
two outer-space rides -- an alien encounter and Plectu's Fantastic Galactic 
Review. A new, 3-D movie by film maker George Lucas, creator of the park's 
Captain Eo ride, will be added, and an entire second story will be built, so 
that skywalks will crisscross all of Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
An attraction based on the Dick Tracy movie will be added in 1996, giving park 
patrons the chance to chase crooks through city streets in racing police 
sedans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most elaborate changes will happen in early 1999, with Disneyland 
adding Hollywoodland -- complete with a white-lettered sign -- with four new 
attractions: a Toon Town ride and Oversized Baby Buggy ride, both of which have 
patrons careening through scenes from the hit movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Two rides planned for the new Hollywoodland are borrowed from Walt Disney 
World: the Great Movie Ride, which lets customers travel through re-creations 
of movie classics, and Superstar TV, in which selected patrons will be able to 
appear in classic episodes of "I Love Lucy" or the Johnny Carson show. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner, who joined Disney six years ago, declined to reveal the costs of the 
additions, other than to say he hoped they would be financed by Disney's 
earnings and that each attraction must meet its company-required return on 
investment. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
