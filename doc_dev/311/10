<LEADPARA>  Perhaps it was inevitable: H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the decorated four-star
general and commander of Operation Desert Storm, is now "Stormin' Norman,"
some people's dream candidate for president.;    The brilliant success of U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf war has fueled speculation about the political
ambitions of two men: Schwarzkopf, the war's blunt-talking strategic
architect, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell, the man who
vowed to "kill" the Iraqi army.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But even as the speculation flares -- could either man follow the road from
the battlefield to the presidency taken by Washington, Jackson, Grant and
Eisenhower? -- political analysts point out that it's not so easy anymore to
translate military fame into political fortune.;    "As I watched
(Schwarzkopf) give the mother of all briefings (Wednesday), certainly the
thought crossed my mind that he would make a delightful candidate," said
Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political Report, a biweekly newsletter
published in Washington. "His kind of straightforward, tell-it-like-it-is
style was well-suited to his task.";    But, said Wyman: "You put that in the
political arena, and quite often it ends up with the old foot in the mouth.
People think it's absolutely charming for the first month, but then they say
'Now what did he say about Social Security?' ";    Indeed, since Republican
bosses handed their party's presidential nomination to Dwight D. Eisenhower in
1952, a lot has changed in American politics. Presidential nominations today
are decided in primaries and caucuses, dominated by activists rather than
insiders.;    Said political analyst William Schneider of the American
Enterprise Institute, "You can't draft anybody anymore. They have to run in
the primaries and earn it.";    But such obstacles haven't halted the
speculation about the two men. It's all the more tantalizing because each
shrugs off questions about his post-Pentagon ambitions, and even their party
allegiances seem a mystery.;    "I think the Republicans fear they're
Democrats and the Democrats fear that they're Republicans," said Democratic
political consultant Bob Squier.;    Since his appointment as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Reagan, there has been speculation Powell
could become the first black president. Asked last June at a National Press
Club luncheon if he intended to run for office after he left the Pentagon,
Powell was coy.;    "I only have one goal right now, and that's to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as best I can, serving the secretary and
the president for this term and whatever additional term they wish me to
serve.";    It is unlikely 1992 will be the year for either man to try for the
presidency, Schneider said; neither man would want to run against President
Bush, his commander in chief. However, some analysts have speculated that Bush
will be tempted to replace Vice President Dan Quayle with Powell as his
running mate.;    An NBC News poll Thursday night found that twice as many
Americans wanted Powell on the Republican ticket as wanted Quayle.  </TEXT>
