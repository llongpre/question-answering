   The Bush administration's top military
officials - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell -
will be conspicuous by their absence Tuesday when the Senate begins
hearings on the buildup toward an ``offensive military option'' in
the Persian Gulf.
   The hearings, scheduled after President Bush decided to send an
additional 200,000 troops to the gulf, get under way with members
of Congress pressing for closer collaboration on gulf policy.
   However, Cheney and Powell will delay their appearances before
the Senate Armed Services Committee until next week, after U.N.
action on a resolution authorizing military force against Iraq.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel,
said Monday that Cheney is ``quite willing to testify before the
committee and will do so on Monday.''
   Powell also is scheduled to appear before the panel.
   After a meeting with the committee's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., Warner said Cheney had delayed his testimony until next
Monday ``to have a report from Secretary of State Baker on the U.N.
resolution.''
   Secretary James A. Baker III is in New York to press the United
Nations Security Council to approve military force to free Kuwait
if Iraq refuses to withdraw its troops. Baker is to testify on
Wednesday of next week before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., asked that the
House be called back from adjournment to discuss the U.N.
resolution, lest war be raging by the time Congress returns as
scheduled in January.
   Several congressional leaders, including Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole, asked earlier this month for a special session,
but that idea quickly died. And there was no indication of action
on Schroeder's request.
   The absence of Cheney from this week's witness list - and the
lack of any guarantee he would testify at all - had been portrayed
as a part of struggle between Nunn, a possible 1992 Democratic
challenger for Bush's job, and the White House.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of the committee, said in
an interview that the hearings were ill-timed and the
administration had every reason to wait before testifying.
   The timing, he said, ``is what you do when your purpose is more
political than policy. Not partisan politics, national politics.
The chairman is opening a presidential campaign,'' Wallop said
referring to Nunn.
   Nunn invited Cheney and Powell to appear before the panel nearly
two weeks ago to discuss the administration's policy since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The military leaders have had prominent roles in defending
Bush's decision to send the additional troops to the gulf to
provide a potential attack force. And many in Congress have said
the administration has yet to justify such a strategic shift.
   With Baker, Cheney and Powell unavailable until next week, the
witness list for this week's Armed Services sessions reads less
like a high-level policy consultation than like the lineup for
recent television talk shows.
   On Tuesday, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director James
Schlesinger will testify during a morning session with a closed
briefing by intelligence officials scheduled in the afternoon.
   Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen William J. Crowe Jr., and
David C. Jones will appear on Wednesday morning and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is scheduled to appear that
afternoon.
   Thursday's hearing includes former Navy Secretary James Webb,
former assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle and Edward Luttwak
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   Bush's announcement that he was greatly increasing the U.S.
deployment in the Persian Gulf - and adding the offensive
capability - touched off criticism by lawmakers, including Nunn who
said the administration had failed to justify a policy shift from a
defensive to offensive stance.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, a senior member of the House Armed
Services Committee sent a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., urging him to call back the House to debate the U.N.
resolution.
   Rep. Schroeder, who contended two weeks ago that it would be
useless for Congress to return in a special session to debate a
hypothetical action, said Monday a possible resolution makes a
session necessary.
   ``All of a sudden the time has come,'' Schroeder said in a
telephone interview. ``It would look awfully silly if we come back
and this thing is raging.''
   Congress included in its adjournment resolution in late October
a provision giving the Democratic leadership, in consultation with
the Republican minority, the authority to call Congress back in an
emergency.
   Schroeder said she did not think Congress would oppose the U.N.
resolution but ``we have to at least debate it.''
   Meanwhile, a delegation of 19 House members left on Sunday for a
weeklong visit to the Persian Gulf region.
