   President Bush is expected to nominate former
White House national security adviser Gen. Colin L. Powell as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, administration sources say.
   Powell, at 52, would become the youngest man, and the first
black, to become the nation's top military officer.
   The four-star Army general, who now heads the Forces Command at
Fort McPherson, Ga., would take over the prestigious position from
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is due to retire Sept. 30.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the White House was expected to make the
announcement today.
   In a statement anticipating the announcement, Sen. Sam Nunn,
chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, called Powell ``an
excellent nominee'' and said his panel would hold confirmation
proceedings soon after Congress returns from recess in September.
   Nunn, D-Ga., said Powell's ``proven abilities and his
experiences provide a sound foundation for his advice on
wide-ranging defense issues in times of severe budget constraints
and a rapidly changing international scene.''
   Gen. P.X. Kelley, who worked with Powell in the Pentagon before
retiring as commandant of the Marine Corps, once described him as
``a very extraordinary guy.''
   ``He can handle stress extremely well. He never gets rattled. He
was always a cool head,'' Kelley said.
   In the post of chairman, Powell would act as the principal
military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense.
   During the most recent hostage crisis, Crowe was a frequent
visitor to the White House, offering his assessment of the military
options available to Bush.
   Under a new management reform program instituted by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, the chairman wields greater influence over
the Pentagon's budget and is able to advise the secretary of
defense on ``the full range of issues'' that come before him.
   The chairman also is allowed to offer his own opinion to the
president and defense secretary, eschewing past practice of only
passing on the opinion of the joint chiefs, who are in charge of
the various military branches.
   The selection of Powell would mean that the Army general would
leap over numerous more senior, and more experienced, military
officers. A leading candidate for the position has been Air Force
Gen. Robert Herres, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
   Powell distinguished himself in the highly visible White House
roles of national security adviser and deputy national security
adviser and was well-known to Bush during his tenure as vice
president.
   Powell was the first black to be named chief of the NSC when
President Reagan tapped him for the post in November 1987.
   He rose to the White House post after working with his
predecessor, Frank Carlucci, to reform the scandal-wracked office
in the days after the Iran-Contra affair.
   Pentagon officials expressed hope that Powell will be warmly
received in Congress. But his selection was expected by Pentagon
insiders to cause some ripples of discontent because he was named
only recently to the four-star level and lacks the broad experience
of many senior military officers who have held the post in the past.
   In speaking to groups of young blacks, he often warns them of
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil
rights revolution.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   In heading the Forces Command since April, he was charged with
keeping the 1 million Army active, reserve and National Guard
troops in the United States ready for combat in defense of the
continental United States.
   Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps
in West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger's senior military assistant from 1983-86.
   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a
bachelor's degree in geology at the City University of New York,
and later earned a master's degree in business administration from
George Washington University. He served in the Office of Management
and Budget in 1972 during a term as a White House fellow.
   Powell served in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, and holds
the Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.
