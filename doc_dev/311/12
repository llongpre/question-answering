   President Bush said he will nominate Gen. Colin L. Powell, whom he called a "complete soldier," to be chairman of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

   Gen. Powell, 52 years old, served two combat tours in Vietnam and has considerable experience in the bureaucratic wars here, having been President Reagan's last national security adviser. 
Gen. Powell will be the first black to be the nation's top military officer. 

   Congress recently reorganized the Pentagon's command structure by taking away some authority from the heads of the individual services and giving it to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
The new arrangement, intended to streamline decision-making in a crisis, has yet to be given a real test. 

   Gen. Powell doesn't have the breadth of experience of the man he will replace, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who commanded joint U.S. military forces in the Pacific and in Europe before becoming chairman of the joint chiefs. 
But Gen. Powell is likely to have a smooth time winning Senate confirmation. 

   Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, called Gen. Powell "an excellent nominee," adding that the general's "proven abilities and his experiences provide a sound foundation for his advice on wide-ranging defense issues in times of severe budget constraints and a rapidly changing international scene." 

   Gen. Powell was serving in his only major military command, U.S. Forces Command in Atlanta, when Mr. Bush chose him for the top military job over more than two dozen generals and admirals who have greater seniority. 
Gen. Powell was appointed this spring to Forces Command, which is responsible for taking control of U.S. Army units in a crisis and preparing them to be sent overseas. 

   Born and raised in the South Bronx section of New York, Gen. Powell is the son of Jamaican immigrants. 
He joined the Army in 1958. 
After serving in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, he got his first exposure to high-level Washington in 1972, when he was selected to serve as a White House fellow. 

   Amid tours of duty in West Germany and South Korea, Gen. Powell spent six years working as a top military assistant in the office of the secretary of defense, where he met many of the top officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
President Reagan made him his national security adviser in 1987, and Gen. Powell is generally credited with restoring the integrity of the office in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal. 

   Adm. Crowe is scheduled to retire on Sept. 30.
