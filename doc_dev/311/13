GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early
as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, but flatly denied this was
because of disagreements with the Clinton administration.
He appeared on morning television shows after a report in the New York Times
had quoted 'friends and associates' as saying he was unhappy with President
Bill Clinton's determination to admit homosexuals to the US military and
with the extent of the defence budget cuts under consideration.
Gen Powell's second two-year term as chairman of the joint chiefs is to
expire at the end of September.
He said yesterday that he had told Mr Dick Cheney, the previous secretary of
defence, last summer that he would not seek a third term, even if President
George Bush were re-elected last November. The general added that he had
spoken then of leaving the post a month or two early so as to resettle his
family.
He vigorously denied suggestions that he was at odds with the new
administration's policies: 'I'm not in any conflict with the administration
over their plans and I am not planning to retire early as a result of any
conflict.'
Gen Powell said the military had received 'good guidance' from Mr Clinton
and Mr Les Aspin, the new secretary of defence, with both of whom he had 'a
fine relationship'. He said he had every intention of testifying before
Congress in support of the new and reduced defence budget.
The general was also at pains to stress that the military at large was not
distressed by the new policies. 'There's nobody over here in a blue funk,
thinking the whole word has dropped on us,' he said. 'We shouldn't let the
impression be created around the country that somehow we are fighting the
president.'
He reiterated his 'concerns' about admitting gays to the military, but said
the president's guidance on the issue was clear and he was not about to be
'insubordinate' by frustrating it.
Gen Powell, 55 and black, is rated a phenomenally successful chairman of the
joint chiefs, and not only because of the victory in the Gulf war. His
doctrine of 'maximum force' has been criticised by some who feel that it
delayed US intervention in humanitarian crises such as that in Somalia, but
his reluctance to commit forces overseas without a clearly defined mission
commands much respect in Washington, where he is rated as a consummate
politician.
