   Gen. Colin L. Powell, President Bush's choice
to ride herd on Pentagon rivalries as the next chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be an ``honest broker'' who will
present all sides to the man in the Oval Office, his associates
predicted Thursday.
   Powell, 52, is slated to take over from Adm. William Crowe on
Oct. 1 after what is widely expected to be an easy confirmation in
the Senate. He'll make history as the youngest officer and the
first black ever to hold the post.
   The four-star Army general will be the 12th man to hold the
position of top military adviser to the nation's commander-in-chief.
   Bush and Powell draw on a years-long relationship, honed inside
the White House when both served under President Reagan.
   Their shared easy-going style was evident during Thursday's Rose
Garden nomination ceremony, when reporters started to pop questions.
   ``Shall we go before they (reporters) start getting excited?''
Bush quipped to Powell, who chuckled as they turned toward the Oval
Office.
   While the general is known for a tough, business-like approach
and intellectual demeanor, he's also got a ready smile and keen
sense of humor.
   On one of President Reagan's annual Palm Springs vacation trips,
Powell joined White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater at the press
corps' traditional New Year's Eve family party _ even going so far
as to don a funny hat and toot on a noisemaker as midnight arrived.
   ``He can make fun of himself. He can be very funny, and not be
silly. But he never loses his dignity,'' said Dan Howard, the
former spokesman for the National Security Council who worked with
Powell at the White House.
   ``He was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all
the internal conflicts'' that the national security adviser must
resolve for the president, said Howard, recently confirmed as
undersecretary of the Navy.
   ``Colin was an honest broker. ... He was very fair in presenting
others' viewpoints. That doesn't mean he didn't have one, because
he did. He was just very fair, and could present all sides without
putting a `spin' on it. That's a rare talent in this town,'' Howard
said.
   Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to
deal with the Pentagon's intense interservice rivalries. Contests
among the services branches are widely expected to reach new highs
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet
threat diminishes.
   As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political
finesse with Congress are as essential as tough battlefield
instincts.
   ``The chairmanship's political now,'' observed one senior
Pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified.
``Powell's got great political adroitness. He'll get a great
reception on Capitol Hill, and he's got experience dealing with the
Soviets.''
   Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the
Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have
outweighed his military experience. But those who know him contend
that his mix of jobs, in command roles and political trenches of
Washington, will stand him in good stead.
   ``He's been head of the NSC. He's commanded troops in Europe.
He's dealt with the guard and reserve in his current post and he's
been at the elbow of the secretary of defense. He's had experiences
few can match,'' said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who
knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's
military aide.
   ``He's had a lot of staff jobs because he's so good,'' Sims
said. ``He's an excellent choice _ and extraordinary leader and a
great human being.''
   Sims and Howard both agreed that Powell can be expected to keep
his political views to himself and take a pragmatic approach.
   ``He plays those things close to the vest. He cares intensely
about such things, but he's not driven by ideology,'' Howard said.
   The issue of race is one that has rarely been mentioned by
Powell, but his acquaintances say it is not the reason he was been
chosen.
   Powell has rarely spoken of race in public, but a speech at a
meeting last year of the Joint Center for Political Studies, a
black think tank in Washington, he recalled those who ``suffered
and sacrificed to create the conditions and set the stage for me.''
   ``And I am also mindful that the struggle (against racism) is
not over ... until every American is able to find his or her own
place in our society limited only by his or her own ability and his
or her own dream,'' he said.
