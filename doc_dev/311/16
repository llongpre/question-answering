   WASHINGTON -- President Bush said he will reappoint Gen.
Colin Powell to a new two-year term as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, a step apparently designed to squelch talk
of tension between them.
   Gen. Powell's current term doesn't expire until Oct. 1.
Mr. Bush, who lavished praise on his top military adviser,
said he decided to make his intentions known now "to
demonstrate my great confidence in his ability and the
tremendous respect that I have for him."

   Gen. Powell, who is 54 years old, has been widely praised
for his role in the successful war against Iraq. But in
recent weeks, there has been speculation that Mr. Bush was
unhappy after a book by author Bob Woodward made public Gen.
Powell's initial preference for a policy of prolonged
economic sanctions rather than military force to expel Iraqi
troops from Kuwait.
   Some senior Republican officials said Mr. Bush is
privately very unhappy over the book and the suggestion that
Gen. Powell wasn't fully behind the administration's strategy
on Iraq.
   Although neither Mr. Bush nor Gen. Powell disputed the
book's portrayal in comments to reporters yesterday, both
dismissed the significance of its assertions. "It's a
pleasure working within a team that you can give advice on
all options," Gen. Powell said. And Mr. Bush said of Gen.
Powell and other military commanders: "To the degree they
were not rushing to commit our young men and women to battle
(that) is exactly the way they should have been."
