<HEAD>Senate Confirms Powell to Chair Joint Chiefs of Staff</HEAD>

   Gen. Colin L. Powell was confirmed by the
Senate early today to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _
the youngest person and first black to hold the nation's highest
military post.
   Powell, 52, was approved on a voice vote without debate or
dissent. He will replace Adm. William Crowe Jr., who is scheduled to
retire Oct. 1 after 43 years in the service.
   Powell served as national security adviser in the final years of
President Reagan's administration.
   At his confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Powell said cuts in the Bush administration's
budget request for various weapons programs could undermine the
U.S.-Soviet pace on reducing strategic arms.
   Powell also said political changes in the Soviet Union should not
lead to cuts in the Star Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles
or the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Cuts approved by the House would ``completely unhinge'' the U.S.
negotiating position in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Powell
said.
   ``Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that
we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he told the
senators.
   He said he supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs
and in response to terrorist attacks. And, he said he was ``very
hesitant'' to cut U.S. troops in South Korea, Europe and other
overseas posts to satisfy current budget demands.
   Most recently, Powell was commander of the Army Forces Command in
Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1
million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
   Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House
recover from the Iran-Contra affair. He was a key figure in the
planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Before moving to the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps in
West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger's senior military assistant from 1983
through 1986.
   Powell was born to Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 and got his first
taste of the White House in 1972 as a White House fellow at the
Office of Management and Budget.
   Powell served as an adviser to South Vietnamese units in 1962-63
and as an executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a
division operations officer in 1968-69. He was awarded a Purple
Heart for being wounded in combat and a Bronze Star for valor.
