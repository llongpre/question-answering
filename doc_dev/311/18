<HEAD>Vice Chairman of Joint Chiefs To Retire</HEAD>

   Gen. Robert Herres, the first officer to serve
as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has asked to
retire next year, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney accepted Herres' request ``with
regret,'' adding in a statement, ``I can hardly say `no' to a man
who has served his nation so capably for nearly 36 years.''
   The Air Force general has been serving as the deputy for the new
chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell, who succeeded Adm.
William Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1.
   Herres was appointed to the newly-created position of vice
chairman in 1987 by President Reagan and was reappointed to the
post by Bush last May.
   Herres was widely reported to have been Crowe's choice for the
post of the president's chief military adviser.
   But President Bush, who had worked with Powell when he served as
the national security adviser to President Reagan, chose the Army
general instead.
   Two Navy admirals have been reported to be leading contenders
for the deputy post, including Adm. Powell Carter Jr., who is the
commander of the Atlantic Fleet, and Vice Adm. Jonathan Howe, who
served as Crowe's principal assistant.
