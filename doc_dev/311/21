   The Senate confirmed Gen. Colin Powell, a former top Pentagon aide who served as White House national security adviser at the end of the Reagan administration, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

   Gen. Powell, 52 years old, is known for his good relations with congressional leaders over the years. 
His nomination was approved by a voice vote. 
He is scheduled to replace Adm. William Crowe as the president's top military adviser Sunday. 

   Gen. Powell has advocated a cautious approach toward cutting U.S. forces overseas or eliminating major strategic-weapons systems. 
He also has supported more-active military involvement in international anti-drug efforts.
