<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin Powell said today the withdrawal of U.S. troops occupying Iraq may
take about a month after Saddam Hussein agrees to the United Nation's cease
fire terms. Powell said U.S. warplanes would continue to fly over Iraq.;   
The complete removal of all U.S. combat forces -- and an end to combat
overflights -- will depend on Iraqi acceptance of the U.N. conditions, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Powell said he believed that a U.N. peacekeeping force will be able to move
in swiftly, paving the way for the withdrawal of U.S. troops occupying the
southern sector of Iraq.;    "I don't think it will take months; it can happen
rather quickly. There are U.N. forces in the region that could be moved to
that particular sight," Powell said. "It could get started in a matter of days
and be in place in a matter of weeks.";    Powell said his contacts with
military colleagues in other countries tell him that there is "some leaning
forward on the part of U.N. members" to participate in the U.N. force.  </TEXT>
