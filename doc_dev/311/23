   The nation's top military officer, Gen. Colin
Powell, jumped into the thick of the battle over the Pentagon
budget today, saying quick and severe cuts in military spending
would break ``the back of our armed forces.''
   ``If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a peace
dividend, you will have neither,'' Powell said in a speech prepared
for delivery to the National Press Club.
   The speech was the general's first major address on the debate
over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of
lessened East-West tensions.
   Powell, a former national security advisor, was sworn in as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff nine months ago. In that
role, he serves as the president's primary military counselor and
coordinator of the nations' military leaders.
   The general said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen
during that time and the Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated, he has
been called upon to put American men and women in uniform in harm's
way.
   ``I have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman
that this is still a dangerous world and that you'd better be able
to respond if someone challenges your interests,'' he said, citing
Panama, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, Europe and Korea as
examples.
   Powell said that while the Soviet Union has experienced dramatic
change, its military retains the capability of destroying the
United States with nuclear weaponry within 30 minutes.
   ``We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a
decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the
enduring realities we face,'' Powell said.
   He noted that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this week
put forward a plan for cutting the military forces by 25 percent
over five years, signalling that ``we are willing to examine any
reasonable proposal.''
   But Powell also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as ``a realistic, prudent response''
to the changing world.
   That plan, the general said, will begin to reduce the nation's
forces over time. ``On this glide path we will reach a base force
which I believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match
enduring defense needs with enduring realities,'' Powell said.
   ``We know we will get smaller. That is inevitable,'' Powell
said. But if Bush's budget request is cut back significantly, ``you
will force us to start breaking faith'' with the nation's
all-volunteer force.
   ``You will force us to start breaking the back of our armed
forces,'' he said.
   The general also took aim at those, primarily on Capitol Hill,
who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time.
Although he named no names, House Armed Services Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., has been sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent
plan, and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has
complained about ``blanks'' in Cheney's budget.
   Chiding ``people who clamor for new strategies, new vision, new
thinking,'' Powell asked such critics for time to plan for a
gradual reduction of forces.
   ``We are looking ahead with our eyes open. We're cutting
programs. We want to close bases. We've frozen construction and
hiring. We're cutting troops, we're cutting generals,'' the general
said.
   ``What we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins,
what we need is breathing space. We need to time to make the plans
work,'' Powell said.
