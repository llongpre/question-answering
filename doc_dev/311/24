   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the career soldier
who became national security adviser in 1987, has been chosen by
President Reagan to command Army forces in the United States.
   The move by the 51-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants from
national security adviser to full general and command of U.S. Forces
Command would put Powell back in the running to become Army chief of
staff eventually.
   Powell would also become only the fourth black officer to attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces if the Senate confirms the
nomination.
   He would join Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph as the second
black four-star officer currently on active duty.
   The first such officer in American history was Air Force Gen.
Daniel ``Chappie'' James, who won his rank in August 1975. He died
shortly after retiring in 1978. The second was Army Gen. Roscoe
Robinson, who won his fourth star on Aug. 30, 1982, and retired in
November 1985.
   In taking over Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Ga.,
Powell would succeed Gen. Joseph T. Palastra Jr., who has held the
post since June 1986 and is retiring after 35 years of active
military service.
   The change of command will probably occur in April, the Army
said. The Forces Command oversees both active duty and reserve
troops in the United States, except Hawaii, which falls under the
Pacific command.
   The Army has 11 full generals, but sources at the Pentagon said
the Forces Command position was likely to be the only four-star post
to open during the next year and that rumors had been circulating
for some time that Powell was in line for the job. ``The White House
handled this one directly,'' said one official.
   A tall, husky man described as a ``soldier's soldier'' who
doesn't particularly like staff jobs, Powell has received uniformly
high marks from official Washington for his performance at the White
House.
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Powell and Reagan
``have had a close personal relationship.''
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran-Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the national Security Council itself,'' Fitzwater said.
   Powell succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as Reagan's national security
adviser after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring Caspar W.
Weinberger as defense secretary a year ago.
   Carlucci had replaced Navy Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who
resigned when the arms-for-hostage affair became public.
   Powell first came to the attention of Weinberger and Carlucci
when he was tapped as a White House fellow in 1972. He served as
Weinberger's top military aide from 1983 to 1986, then joined the
NSC staff as Carlucci's deputy after brief service as commander of
the Army's V Corps in West Germany.
   Powell was born in New York City to Jamaican immigrants. He is a
graduate of the City College of New York and received a master's
degree in business administration from George Washington University
here.
   Commissioned in the infantry in 1958, he was wounded twice during
two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened
bamboo sticks and impaling a foot.
   His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
   Powell and his wife, Alma, have two daughters and a son.
