<LEADPARA>  President Bush shrugged off allegations Thursday that Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had counseled against military action
in the early days of the Persian Gulf crisis.;    Bush, responding to excerpts
from a new book by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward, said Powell has the
"integrity and the honor" to offer candid advice and the discipline to "salute
and march" when the president makes a decision.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Nevertheless, Bush appeared to confirm Woodward's assertion that Powell
initially had opposed the idea of using military force against Iraq and had
recommended an extended use of sanctions to push Saddam Hussein out of
Kuwait.;    According to the book, "The Commanders," Powell advised as late as
October that a policy of "containment or strangulation" eventually would force
Iraq to quit Kuwait, even though it might take as long as two years.;    Bush
said Thursday that he appreciated the frank advice he received from Powell and
others who counseled patience, although he chose to reject it. The bottom
line, Bush told reporters at a White House photo session, was that the war was
"a superb military operation. . . . It went very, very well.";    Washington
insiders, Bush said, "feed endlessly -- like piranha fish -- on this kind of
information," but in the end, such accounts are merely "nit-picking analyses
after the fact.";    Woodward's book is due out today but the Post and other
newspapers ran extensive articles about it Thursday. After the articles
appeared, Bush said, he called Powell and told him: " 'If you have any Angst
(about the story), forget about it.' (Powell) said, 'I don't.' ";    Powell is
"a generous and superb commander and a great chairman of the Joint Chiefs and
nobody's gonna drive a wedge between him and me," Bush said.;    Woodward's
book, Bush said, "has some things in it that are true, I'm sure, but I guess
the only things that I've seen in it called to my attention are those that
aren't. So I, in fairness, ought to read it -- which I don't plan to do right
away because I'm very busy in my line of work.";    Powell has not read the
book and had no comment on it, said a spokesman.;    An aide to Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney said Cheney is familiar with the book and believes that
some of Woodward's reconstructed dialogue is inaccurate and that his
interpretation of some events is askew. But Cheney has no serious quarrel with
it, the aide said.  </TEXT>
