<LEADPARA>  AMERICANS on Memorial Day remembered their war dead, from the Civil War to the
Persian Gulf war -- and even the drug wars.;    "Operation Desert Storm truly
was a victory of good over evil, of freedom over tyranny, of peace over war,"
Vice President Dan Quayle said at a service at Arlington National Cemetery.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remembered
another war. Powell, at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, said Vietnam
veterans have no need to redeem themselves.;    Standing in front of the black
marble wall that bears the names of 58,175 Americans who died in Vietnam,
Powell said Americans "should be every bit as proud of every name on that wall
and every man and woman who fought in Vietnam as you are of any veteran
America has ever had.";    In Gettysburg, Pa. nine Civil War veterans were
finally laid to rest as 10,000 people looked on.;    Their remains had been
part of a private relic collection until they were donated this year to the
National Park Service.;    Historians don't know the soldiers' names, how they
died or even which of them were Union or Confederate. That didn't seem to
matter.;    Some Americans remembered relatives who weren't military
veterans.;    In Inglewood, a Los Angeles suburb, Gladys Kelly planted a pine
tree in memory of her son, Eugene, who was killed in a drive-by shooting last
year.;    She said that while losing someone in a foreign war is difficult,
"it's nothing like (losing) a member of my family . . . to outrageous wars
we're having right here."  </TEXT>
