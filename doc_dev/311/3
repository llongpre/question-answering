Colin Powell take questions from reporters after Bush announced he was again
appointing the four-star general to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
appointment is subject to Senate confirmation, and Powell is expected to be
asked about his reported disagreement with White House decision-making on the
gulf war.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  President Bush said Thursday that he was appointing Gen. Colin Powell to a
second two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, even as Bush
hinted that Powell early on had recommended against going to war in the
Persian Gulf.;    Bush's reappointment of Powell, while not surprising,
underscored the president's intention to keep Vice President Dan Quayle in the
No. 2 slot on the ticket in 1992 and demonstrated that Bush is unconcerned
about a published report that Powell had serious reservations about the use of
force in the gulf.  </LEADPARA>

JOINT CHIEFS NOMINATION ENDS SPECULATION
ABOUT REPLACING QUAYLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The new term would begin Oct. 1 and is subject to Senate confirmation.;   
Powell, 54, a four-star Army general and decorated Vietnam veteran with
considerable political experience in the White House during the Reagan
administration, had been widely viewed as a possible vice presidential
candidate if Bush decided to dump Quayle.;    In announcing the reappointment
in the Rose Garden, Bush declared of Powell: "Look, he has done a fantastic
job. I can think of no one more qualified to lead our armed forces as we
prepare them for the challenges of the 21st century.";    The Bush
announcement also was one more indication that Bush's opinion of Powell was
untarnished by disclosures in a new book that Powell had repeatedly argued for
"containment" of Iraq by economic and military pressures, not war.;    The
book by Bob Woodward published two weeks ago said Powell argued against war in
a personal meeting with the president but that Bush replied, "I don't think
there's time politically for that strategy," which Powell said could take a
year or two.  </TEXT>
