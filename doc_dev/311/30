   Remarks about plans for possible U.S. air
assaults on Iraq cost Gen. Michael J. Dugan his job as Air Force
chief of staff, but the incident was not the first time the
four-star general rankled his Pentagon bosses.
   Dugan, fired by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday, said in
a statement that he regretted ``any embarrassment'' his comments
caused the Bush administration. Cheney said Dugan, 53, would be
forced to retire, ending a 32-year Air Force career that included a
stint as commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.
   Several days after President Bush committed U.S. troops to
Operation Desert Shield on Aug. 7 to deter a possible Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia, Dugan was quoted in a published report as
saying the United States had ruled out using chemical weapons or
battlefield nuclear arms if fighting broke out with Iraq.
   That comment caused a stir in the Pentagon, where military
authorities have been careful not to preclude any options in order
to complicate Baghdad's planning.
   Dugan also had been the object of private complaints by U.S.
commanders in Saudi Arabia.
   An aide to Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told a reporter during Powell's visit to Saudi Arabia last
week that Dugan was one of several military authorities who were
talking too much in public about contingency plans.
   ``Saddam already has you guys giving away the store, we don't
need to help him any more,'' the aide said, speaking privately.
   In explaining his decision to dump Dugan, Cheney told a Pentagon
news conference that the Air Force chief displayed a ``lack of
judgment'' by engaging publicly in ``wide-ranging speculation''
about U.S. military options in Iraq.
   Dugan was quoted by the Los Angeles Times and The Washington
Post as saying the Joint Chiefs of Staff had decided that U.S. air
power - including a massive bombing campaign against Baghdad that
specifically targeted President Saddam Hussein - was the only
effective way to force Iraq out of Kuwait if war erupted.
   ``If and when we choose violence he ought to be at the focus of
our efforts,'' Dugan was quoted as saying, referring to a military
strategy known as decapitation.
   Cheney said Dugan confirmed to him that he had made the
comments, which were reported by the newspapers during Dugan's
visit last week to U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   In his brief statement issued through the Air Force public
affairs office at the Pentagon, Dugan said his comments to the
Times and Post reflected his personal views and ``should not be
construed to reflect any plans or the position'' of the Bush
administration.
   ``I sincerely regret any embarrassment that my comments may have
caused the administration,'' Dugan said. Officials in his Pentagon
office said he was not available for further comment Monday.
   Cheney told reporters he would recommend to Bush that Gen.
Merrill A. McPeak replace Dugan. McPeak, 54, is commander of
Pacific Air Forces, based in Hawaii.
   Dugan took the top Air Force job in July and quickly gained a
reputation for openness with the news media and Congress. One
gesture that illustrated this departure from past Air Force
practice was his decision to give defense reporters laminated cards
listing his office phone number and the numbers of his chief aides.
   An Irishman with a breezy personal style, Dugan's attempts at
openness were a clear departure from the practice of his
predecessors. A small example of Dugan's approach was his recent
insistence that his public affairs office respond immediately to a
published report in which an airman in Saudi Arabia complained of a
lack of gear designed to protect against chemical arms attacks.
   Cheney lauded Dugan's long Air Force career but said the
four-star general has no future in the military.
   ``He will be retired,'' Cheney said. ``Gen. Dugan is a fine
officer with an outstanding record of 32 years of service to the
Air Force and to the nation,'' Cheney said. ``This was not a
pleasant action for me to take but a necessary one.''
