<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had serious
reservations last fall about the Bush administration's shift toward an
offensive military strategy in the Persian Gulf, according to a new book by
Washington Post editor Bob Woodward.;    Powell repeatedly suggested that
"containment" of Iraq through economic and military pressures could accomplish
U.S. objectives short of war, the book says.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Late in October, Woodward writes, before President Bush's crucial decision
to double U.S. ground forces in the gulf, Powell argued his case with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary
of State James Baker, finding support only from Baker.;    He finally raised
the issue with Bush, "arguing that containment would take time, maybe as long
as a year or two, but it would work.";    Bush, according to Woodward's
account, answered: "I don't think there's time politically for that
strategy.";    After that meeting, Powell felt he had gone as far as he could.
"I've been for a containment strategy," Powell is quoted as telling his
predecessor, retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., "but it hasn't been selling
around here or over there," pointing out his Pentagon window toward the White
House.;    Woodward's book, "The Commanders," to be published Friday by Simon
&amp; Schuster, contains numerous fresh disclosures about the decision-making
process at the highest levels of the Bush administration. The book portrays
Bush and his senior advisers as secretive, sometimes indecisive, occasionally
impulsive and often at odds with each other -- in contrast to the image of
harmony they presented throughout the crisis.;    Powell felt left out; 
Powell, in particular, is described as upset at being left out of some key
decisions.;    For example, he learns only by watching television of Bush's
declaration that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "will not stand," a dramatic shift
from Bush's earlier public statements.;    Woodward appears to have obtained
inside accounts of crucial National Security Council meetings, including many
direct quotations, as well as extensive notes of a conversation in August
between Cheney and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd about the U.S. offer to deploy
military forces to defend the Saudi kingdom.;    As he did in his best-selling
books on the Watergate affair, the Supreme Court and the Central Intelligence
Agency, Woodward uses a controversial narrative technique to tell his story --
presenting the words and thoughts of principal figures, sometimes through
direct quotation, without attribution.;    The book describes how the main
decision-makers felt, thought and reacted to events, focusing on the attitudes
and emotions of Powell, Cheney and Scowcroft.;    It appears that senior
members of the administration, which prides itself on loyalty and is led by a
president with a penchant for secrecy, made themselves available to Woodward
at critical junctures in the gulf crisis.;    Among Woodward's other
highlights:;    (check) Two days before the invasion of Kuwait, a Defense
Intelligence Agency analyst, Pat Lang, bluntly warned in a memo that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein intended to invade. Lang intended his memo as "a
thunderclap" to top policy-makers, Woodward writes, but it drew virtually no
reaction.;    'Flash warning';  On Aug. 1, hours before the invasion, Lang
drafted another top-secret "flash warning," forecasting an attack that night
or the next morning. Powell "suggested that Cheney sound the alarm at the
White House . . . to mobilize the president, get him to perhaps issue a
presidential warning to Saddam through secret diplomatic channels," but Cheney
dismissed the buildup as a bluff by Saddam. No warning was sent.;    (check)
After an initial high-level meeting on the crisis Aug. 2, Bush and Scowcroft
concluded that other top Bush advisers were not taking the invasion seriously
enough.;    (check) The president appeared determined, from the early days of
the crisis, to go beyond defending Saudi Arabia, an objective he did not share
at the time with the American people or congressional leaders. At an Aug. 3
National Security Council meeting, Bush ordered the CIA to begin planning for
a covert operation that would destabilize the Iraqi regime, Woodward reports.
But in a speech Aug. 8, Bush said, "The mission for our troops is wholly
defensive.";    (check) Baker harbored reservations about the initial buildup,
confiding to several of his closest aides that the White House was, in
Woodward's words, "speeding, not thinking through what it was doing.";   
(check) On Dec. 29, Bush signed a top-secret "warning order," activating U.S.
forces for war and authorizing Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf to begin the
offensive Jan. 17. This order was sent out before the last-minute diplomatic
maneuvering and public jostling over deadlines for Iraqi forces to withdraw
from Kuwait, Woodward reports.;    Uneasy about Bush;  The book also delves
into how the administration's principal figures felt about each other
personally. For example, after the 1988 presidential election, Powell turned
down Bush's offer to head the CIA, Woodward reports, in part because "he felt
uneasy about the man who was about to become president.";    Woodward says
that Powell "was also troubled by the way the Bush presidential campaign had
been run. The race-baiting Willie Horton television commercial especially
bothered him.";    Cheney is described as unhappy with White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu. A couple of days after Iraq's invasion, Cheney asked for
one of the White House's large helicopters to fly members of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff from the Pentagon to Camp David for an Aug. 4 meeting with the
president. Sununu denied the request.;    Woodward reports Cheney's caustic
reaction: "Typical crap out of Sununu's office, Cheney thought. He felt that
Sununu had adopted an imperial role for himself as chief of staff. . . . Once
Bush had been late for a Cabinet meeting, and Sununu had plunked himself down
in the president's chair -- a small impropriety, but to Cheney it symbolized
the self-importance Sununu brought to the post."  </TEXT>
