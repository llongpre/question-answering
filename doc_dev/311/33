<LEADPARA>  To Martha Martinez, Saddam Hussein is a doll.;    But that's only because she
is a doll maker whose talents have taken a patriotic, if vengeful, turn. It's
hard to ignore a voodoo-like bent in her 28-inch Iraqi dictator dolls.  </LEADPARA>

Mideast Roundup  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The $25 stuffed Saddams, available at the Center for Southern Folklore
here, are designed for dismemberment.;    The dictator's arms and legs are
attached with Velcro, and around his neck hangs this handwritten poem:;   
"Pull off my leg, pull off my arm.;    "Cause me all kinds of harm.;    "Make
me pay for my sins.;    "Stick me with these little pins.";    Martinez's
family includes four generations of doll makers who have designed anything
from cotton-stuffed harem girls and sheiks to velvet-clad ladies and an Elvis
doll. But none, until now, has used a dismemberment theme.;    The more Saddam
dolls she makes, the better they get, said Martinez. "It took four or five
tries to get his face right. The first ones looked just like Gene Shalit."; 
MUSICIANS PROTEST WAR BY BOYCOTTING ANTHEM;    Knoxville, Tenn. -- About 15
musicians of the Symphony Orchestra are quietly protesting the playing of the
national anthem while the nation is at war by not appearing at a concert until
the piece is over.;    "It's a question of conscience with them," Kirk Trevor,
musical director and conductor, said Tuesday. "I find no problem with how they
feel. They felt that playing it is a political gesture during wartime.";   
The musicians' absence was barely noticed when it first happened Thursday and
Friday nights at concerts.;    "They waited until we finished with 'The
Star-Spangled Banner' and then quietly took their seats on stage," Trevor
said.;  BLACK CAUCUS MEETS WITH GEN. COLIN POWELL;    Washington -- Members of
the Congressional Black Caucus who met Tuesday with Gen. Colin Powell, the
highest-ranking black military officer in the nation's history, said they
admire the man but still oppose the Persian Gulf war he is helping to direct.;
   "We like the man. We don't like the mission," said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
D-Los Angeles, one of the 26 caucus members.;    House Majority Whip William
Gray, D-Pa., another member of the caucus, said those attending the meeting
understand that Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is "not a
policy maker, he is a policy executor.";    The meeting between Powell and the
black legislators was the second effort by the administration this week to
shore up relations with the black community, which polls show is less
supportive of the war than whites.;    Many African-Americans have complained
that there are a disproportionate number of blacks in the Persian Gulf forces.
Blacks make up 12 percent of the population, but 25 percent of the U.S. forces
in the gulf region.;  HOURS OF BLACK RAIN TERRIFY THE TURKS;    Ankara, Turkey
-- Black rain fell for more than 10 hours in southeastern Turkey, causing
panic among people fearing it was caused by burning oil installations in
Kuwait, officials said Tuesday.;    It was not immediately clear if the black
rain was caused by the burning oil fields or by air pollution, the officials
said.  </TEXT>
