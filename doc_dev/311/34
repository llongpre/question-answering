   The nation's top military official
praised blacks' contributions in U.S. wars at a ceremony Saturday
opening construction of a monument to the ``buffalo soldiers'' who
fought in the West.
   The Buffalo Soldier Monument will honor all black American
soldiers, said Gen. Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``From pre-Revolutionary times through the Revolutionary War,
through every one of our wars and on up to the present, black men
and women have willingly served and died,'' Powell said.
   ``But for most of that time blacks served without recognition or
reward for the contribution they made for our freedom,'' he said,
adding that it was ``freedom they did not enjoy here in their own
beloved native land.''
   The monument is planned for the Fort Leavenworth grounds near
Smith Lake in northeast Kansas, where the buffalo soldiers of the
10th Regiment once camped between campaigns against Indians on the
Great Plains.
   ``America has made enormous progress from the days of the
buffalo soldiers to the days of a black chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff,'' Powell said. ``We aren't perfect. We never will
be. But the beauty of this country is that we're always making
progress.''
   Powell serves as the top military adviser to the president, the
secretary of defense and the National Security Council.
   The 9th and 10th Calvary Regiments of buffalo soldiers were
formed by Congress in 1866 to patrol the western frontier. It was
the Indians who dubbed black men who served in the segregated
regiments the ``buffalo soldiers.''
   In their service from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, the
buffalo soldiers endured discrimination, hardships and neglect that
white regiments didn't have to suffer. They protected settlers,
built forts and fought Apaches and Comanches on the Great Plains
and along the Texas border.
   The monument's design calls for a large bronze statue of a
rifle-carrying buffalo soldier on a horse. In the design, the
soldier stands on rocks between two ponds _ one behind him to
represent the past and a reflective pool in front to see into the
future.
   Water will flow over the rocks into the reflective pool.
