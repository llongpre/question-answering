   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
welcomed 895 West Point cadets to the ranks of commissioned Army
officers Thursday and learned that one of them already is gunning
for his job.
   The ambitious cadet is Kristin Baker, 22, who had already risen
to the top of the academy by becoming brigade commander and the
first female captain of the corps of cadets.
   After Gen. Colin Powell told the graduates of the U.S. Military
Academy that the United States must maintain a strong military, even
though ``the prospect of peace is now more than a dream,'' he
appeared at a news conference with Baker.
   Powell noted that he and Baker had been appointed the same day
last October. Baker than admitted having aspirations to his job.
   ``It takes a long time,'' she said.
   ``About 30 years'' Powell said.
   ``See me in about 30 years,'' said Baker.
   Powell, 53, said the world has changed greatly since he entered
the military in the 1950s, but advised the newly commissioned second
lieutenants to recognize ``what has changed and what has not. We
must identify what threats have receded and which have not.''
   Powell said he believes Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is
``sincere in wanting to reform his country as he is in making sure
it continues to play a dominant role in world affairs.''
   But Powell said that despite any economic revolutions, ``one fact
remains: the Soviet Union will still possess thousands of nuclear
warheads that can destroy America in 30 minutes. We must never allow
ourselves to be at a nuclear disadvantage.''
   West Point's 806 male and 89 female graduates this year list that
includes Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Women were admitted to West Point beginning in 1976. The two
Rhodes Scholarships awarded to cadets this year went to women:
Jennie Koch of Potomac, Md., and Carolyn Ford of Pensacola, Fla.
   Baker, born in Dickinson, N.D., de-emphasized her role as a woman
in her job as brigade commander and said there was still a lot to be
done for women at West Point. She called her appointment ``another
step in a long line of steps being taken for women'' at the
188-year-old school.
