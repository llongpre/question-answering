   WASHINGTON -- The rising tide of approval for U.S.
officials in the wake of the war isn't lifting Vice President
Quayle's standing with the public.
   The new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that half
of voters -- including a plurality of Republicans -- would
rather see Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, than Mr. Quayle as President Bush's vice
presidential running mate next year.

   Fifty percent of registered voters in the poll prefer Gen.
Powell, while 23% prefer Mr. Quayle. Among Republicans, Gen.
Powell leads by 47% to 29%.
   The Journal/NBC poll finds the general's appeal cuts
across racial lines. As the first black person to lead the
nation's armed forces, he is held in high esteem by black
voters: 67% of them have a positive opinion of him, compared
with 54% for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and 44% for Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the allied forces.
   Strikingly, Gen. Powell scores even a bit higher among
white voters than among black voters: According to the
Journal/NBC poll, 70% of whites feel positively toward him.
