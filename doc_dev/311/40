PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has picked General John Shalikashvili, Nato's supreme
commander in Europe, to succeed General Colin Powell as chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff, George Graham reports.
Gen Shalikashvili's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate,
but is expected to take effect when Gen Powell completes his second two-year
term next month.
The chairman is the top US military officer, and Gen Shalikashvili's role
will be particularly important because of Mr Clinton's less than smooth
relationship with the armed forces. Gen Powell opposed sharper cuts in the
defence budget and resisted Mr Clinton's efforts to let homosexuals serve
openly.
Gen Shalikashvili, a 57-year-old artillery officer, was born in Poland and
came to the US at the age of 16. He served as commander of the allied
operation to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, and as assistant to Gen
Powell.
Mr Clinton said yesterday Gen Shalikashvili had been a leader in persuading
Nato to undertake new missions outside its traditional boundaries, including
the recent decision to prepare for possible air strikes in Bosnia.
