<LEADPARA>  IF YOU have paid much attention to Operation Desert Storm military briefings,
you may have noticed that we don't "kill" anybody anymore. Instead, we have
"weapons systems" that "visit" the enemy and deposit our "ordnance," sometimes
with "collateral damage.";    We don't bomb the enemy. We "suppress their
assets." If our "targeting" was "ineffective," we "visit" the enemy again and
"retarget" their "assets."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And a target isn't blown up. It is "degraded," "eliminated," "suppressed"
or "neutralized," just to name a few of the ways military spokespeople
nowadays describe the blowing of something or someone to smithereens.;   
Military people have long tried to fuzz up the language that describes what
they do for a living, but the language of this war is more abstract than ever,
says Rutgers University's William Lutz, chair of the Committee on Public
Doublespeak of the National Council of Teachers of English.;    "Unless you
have some sort of a context, you simply don't know what it means," Lutz said
in a telephone interview.;    In Vietnam, he explained, "air support" was not
a tough term to figure out, and as evasive as such terms as "protective
reaction strikes" or even "limited duration protective reaction strikes" may
have seemed, you still could figure out from the sound of them what they
meant, even if their emotional impact may have been softened somewhat.;   
But, in the gulf, what does "airborne sanitation" mean?;    "It has something
to do with the planes that go in ahead of the bombers to clean out the
anti-aircraft batteries," Lutz said. "Or at least that's what I think it
means.";    Today's military doublespeak triggers no mental picture, said
Lutz. We don't have airplanes. We have a "weapons system." Weapons themselves
have become "assets," which sounds positive enough (it's something we "invest"
in), particularly in the absence of "liabilities.";    Even standard military
terms like "ordnance," which means explosives, have become a new form of
doublespeak because of the way they are used, Lutz observed. "Delivery of
ordnance" sounds like we have just loaded a bomb onto a truck and taken it
somewhere. It really means we are bombing people.;    In Lutz's 1989 book,
"Doublespeak," he traced how language designed to obscure and deceive, rather
than enlighten or clarify, grew along with "technocrats" and
"bureaucratization" in the military.;    Lutz isn't alone in his concern.
Retired Brig. Gen. William Louisell lamented the trend toward military
doublespeak in the August 1988 issue of Armed Forces Journal International.
"Soldiers are beginning to obscure clear thinking with high-sounding,
redundant, glittering generalities," he wrote.;    Virtually all professions
have their own brand of doublespeak, but the language of the gulf war seems to
be characterized by military spokesmen and politicians who are trying
conscientiously to replace language reminiscent of Vietnam with language that
evokes World War II. "Body bags," for example, have become "human remains
pouches.";    Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the American and allied
forces in the gulf, bristled when a reporter mentioned "carpet bombing" during
a press conference, saying he didn't know what the reporter meant by the term,
even though it has been a common military term for saturation bombing since
World War II. Perhaps it simply has no convenient place in a war that
emphasizes "precision targeting" and "smart bombs.";    Accordingly, military
officials are reluctant to talk about "collateral damage" or "incontinent
ordnance," which are nice ways of describing bombs that miss their targets and
perhaps blow to smithereens people we didn't want to hit.;    Yet, clear
language encourages clear thinking, and sanitized language about war can lead
only to murky public perceptions of the whole bloody process.;    Just as it
has become extremely important for Pentagon officials to control media access
to the war, it is important to control its language. But, unlike the debate
over media access, the move toward military doublespeak seems a less tactical
than political one that has less to do with fooling the enemy than with
winning the hearts and minds of the American public.;    As amusing as it is
to play cat-and-mouse with military wordplay, the stark realities of war,
delivered these days with unprecedented intensity by live television, should
remind us of the fact that war kills lots of people in grisly ways, and that
we should be very clear about why and how we are fighting it and whether it is
worth its horrible price.;    When the price is worth it, precise language not
only clarifies, it also can inspire. Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, apparently had that in mind when he described our strategy
toward Iraqi forces as, "First we're going to cut it off, then we're going to
kill it." Such candor has been strikingly rare in this war.;    That's a far
cry from Adm. Wesley McDonald's assessment of Grenada: "We were not
micromanaging Grenada intelligencewise until about that time frame.";    Let's
hope our current time frame doesn't squeeze the intelligence out of our
language.; GENERALLY SPEAKING; Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the
American and allied forces in the gulf, bristled at a press conference and
said he didn't know what a reporter meant by the term 'carpet bombing.';   
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, displayed striking
candor when he described the allied strategy toward Iraqi forces as, 'First
we're going to cut it off, then we're going to kill it.'  </TEXT>
