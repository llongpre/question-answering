<HEAD>US Military Chief Says Iraqi Reinforcement Plan May Backfire</HEAD>

   Iraq's announced plan to send 250,000 more
troops to Kuwait is a publicity ploy and may hurt rather than help
the Iraqi army's war-fighting ability, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Monday that President
Saddam Hussein had decided to form seven additional army divisions
and call up more than 150,000 reservists and regulars, ``adding to
our forces over a quarter of a million fighters.''
   Iraq already has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates, facing off in the gulf area
against 230,000 American forces and at least 100,000 forces of U.S.
allies and other Arab nations.
   President Bush two weeks ago announced plans to send U.S.
reinforcements to the gulf that are expected to increase the
American force to about 430,000 by January.
   In an interview today with ``CBS This Morning,'' Powell said the
announced Iraq reinforcement plan didn't trouble U.S. military
planners, who are preparing for a possible order from Bush to
launch an offensive to liberate Kuwait.
   ``It's not clear that large numbers of additional, probably less
capable units significantly adds to his combat power in theatre;
and in fact, might present him with new vulnerabilities rather than
added strength,'' Powell said.
   The four-star general also said it is possible that Saddam is
planning to use the extra troops as replacements to allow weary
soldiers to rotate back from the front lines.
   ``He may be thinking of doing some rotations and some reliefs in
place,'' Powell said. ``We'll see. But at the moment, it's just
part of his headline-of-the-day program where he tries to divert
world opinion from his own aggression. Yesterday was a troop
buildup. The day before that, it was a hostage release. I think we
always have to keep coming back to the fundamental point that he is
trying to divert attention from his aggression, the fact that he
invaded a neighboring country, and now he is threatening peace in
the region.''
