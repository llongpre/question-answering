   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the first black to
serve as White House national security adviser, was promoted to
full general Thursday during a Pentagon ceremony hosted by the
Army's chief of staff.
   Powell, who is scheduled to assume command of the Forces Command
at Fort McPherson, Ga., on April 4, was surrounded by family,
friends and the Army's top brass as Gen. Carl E. Vuono Jr., the
chief of staff, presided at the ceremony.
   In his new post, Powell will command all Army troops inside the
continental United States, including reserves, and play a key role
in determining the manner in which they are trained and equipped.
   Thursday, he became only the fourth black officer to ever attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. Two of those four are
currently on active duty _ Powell and Air Force Gen. Bernard P.
Randolph.
   The first black four-star general in American history was also
an Air Force officer, Gen. Daniel ``Chappie'' James, who won his
rank in August 1975. He died shortly after retiring in 1978. The
second was Army Gen. Roscoe Robinson, who won his fourth star on
Aug. 30, 1982, and retired in November 1985.
   The move from national security adviser to chief of the Forces
Command was announced in December by then-President Reagan. Powell
succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as Reagan's national security adviser
after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring Caspar W.
Weinberger as defense secretary in late 1987.
