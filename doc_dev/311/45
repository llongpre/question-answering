<LEADPARA>  Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf shed tears Friday as he relinquished command of the
forces he led to war, telling his troops, "I shall always love you and will
never, ever, ever forget you.";    The four-star general handed over the reins
of the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base amid the pomp of a
19-gun salute, a final troop inspection and the jangled strains of "Auld Lang
Syne."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Taking over as commander in chief of the Central Command is Lt. Gen. Joseph
P. Hoar, the deputy chief of staff for plans, policies and operations for the
Marine Corps. He is in line for appointment to four-star rank.;    "Old
warhorses like me look behind me and see the magnificent leaders ready to move
up and take his place," said Schwarzkopf, 56, who wiped tears from his eyes
several times. "He leaves thankful that he has had the honor and privilege of
serving his country.";    Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined dozens of Persian Gulf princes,
sheiks and ambassadors who flew in for the tribute.;    "In a crisis, just one
man can make a difference. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf was such a man," said
Cheney, who pinned Distinguished Service medals from the military branches on
a general whom few civilians had heard of before the gulf war.;    "The whole
world knows you now," Powell said. "They know you because of the story of
victory and courage you have written in the sand, skies and sea of the Persian
Gulf. They are now secure because of your determination and your sacrifice."; 
  Clad in desert camouflage fatigues, Schwarzkopf praised the more than 100
Central Command staff members who stood at attention on the sweltering tarmac
before him. Some were overcome by the 91-degree heat.;    "A lot has been made
of what Schwarzkopf has done, but Schwarzkopf didn't do it," Schwarzkopf said.
"Many are stepping forward today taking credit for what you did, but you know
what you did -- you made history.";    The band from the 24th Infantry
Division of Fort Stewart, Ga., a unit Schwarzkopf once commanded, ended the
tribute with a solemn version of the general's favorite hymn, "Amazing Grace,"
and a familiar Gen. Douglas MacArthur chant -- "Old soldiers never die, they
just fade away.";    It marked only the latest tribute for the gulf war
commander since his return in April. He's been showered by a New York ticker
tape parade, knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, pinned with the Medal of Freedom,
honored by a joint session of Congress and signed to a reported $5 million
book deal.;    Schwarzkopf has even hired an agent to sort out the job offers
and possible political opportunities that await him when he retires at month's
end.;    Retirement will close a 35-year Army career that began at West Point
and ranged from battalion commander in Vietnam to architect of the 100-hour
lightning ground assault that defeated Iraq.  </TEXT>
