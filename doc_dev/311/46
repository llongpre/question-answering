<TEXT>  Somebody had to do it, so the Miami Herald's Tropic magazine asked Zsa Zsa
what she thought of the videotaped police beating of Rodney King in LA. "It's
proof that I was right," she retorted, "and everybody else was wrong about the
LAPD. My cop beat me up, just like Rodney King's beat the hell out of him. My
problem was, I didn't have a video for proof. This cop tore my hair, said 'I'm
going to break your f---ing head open. . . ." Getting a word in edgewise,
Tropic pointed out that it was a Beverly Hills cop, not an LAPD policeman, who
arrested Zsa Zsa. "They're all alike, those cops!" she protested. "Give a
little man a gun, and they'll do that. Of course, you can never say 'all
cops.' There are some wonderful ones."  BURT REYNOLDS; (box) No one's finer
than Dinah; "I was the world's No. 1 box office draw for five years. You don't
know what it's like to go from No. 1 to No. 83," Reynolds said to the Chicago
Tribune. "When you're No. 1 in the world, . . . there's nowhere to hide, and
you have to get your head screwed on real tight, otherwise you're going to end
up like Elvis and Marilyn. You're going to find yourself so unhappy because,
after you're No. 1, there's only one way to go. . . . When you're dropped by
everyone the way I was, you need an enormous faith in God or Zen or Buddha or
whatever. If you don't have something, you're going to go directly to whatever
puts you out of this world, whatever pill, whatever you smoke, whatever you
can stick in your arm, whatever you can drink. I was able to come out of it
with all the gray matter intact because I was extraordinarily lucky in the
friends that I had. At the height of my career, I was with Dinah Shore, and
there never has been anybody in my life who affected me as she did. . . . If I
have a penny's worth of class, she gave it to me.";  PATSY KENSIT; (box) Fame
is a lethal weapon for an absolute beginner; Over here, she's Patsy Who? Or,
"Oh yes, that pretty South African girl who got killed in Lethal Weapon 2."
But in England -- she's not really South African -- she's been called the
"British Madonna," partly for her role in a much-hyped (over there) and
little-seen (over here) film called Absolute Beginners. Now, Kensit is on a
lot of Next Big Thing (i.e., next year's Annette Bening) lists for her role in
a low-budget film called Twenty-One. Quite a lot of ups and downs for someone
who made her film debut at age 4 in The Great Gatsby, as the daughter of Bruce
Dern and Mia Farrow. "Fame is like a wonderful alcoholic drink that tastes so
sweet," Kensit observed in Premiere, "and it is so wonderful, and you want to
have more and more and more. . . . And then you wake up in the morning, and
you've got the . . . worst hangover you've ever had, and it lasts for weeks. I
don't think success is a bad thing; I'd love to be successful. But the whole
star-fame trip -- it's like a drug that can turn on you, and it really does
turn.";  SPIKE LEE; (box) No yellow ribbon for Gen. Powell; Lee has accused
Eddie Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg of Uncle Tom-ism in the past. Now his target
is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose name came up when the
Detroit Free Press asked Lee if Bush had done anything for blacks. "Yeah, get
us killed in the Middle East with the No. 1 Tom, Colin Powell," Lee retorted.
"Any black man who can rise that far in an administration of the United States
government, especially the Bush administration, can't be trusted to have the
best intentions for black people. If Colin Powell was ordered to send the
National Guard into Harlem, or Watts, or Chicago's South Side, he'd do it in a
second. You know, his daughter's an actress. She ain't getting no role in my
films, though."  </TEXT>
