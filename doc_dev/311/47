<LEADPARA>  ON THE afternoon of Friday, Aug. 3, 1990, less than 48 hours after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft welcomed a
concerned Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United
States, to his White House office.;    Scowcroft knew Bandar had direct access
to Saudi King Fahd and could provide a nearly instantaneous read on the king's
attitudes. Bandar seemed to come down on the U.S. side on most matters. Now,
with some of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops moving toward the Saudi
border, Scowcroft had a serious message for Bandar to convey to Fahd.  </LEADPARA>

First of three parts
Today the Mercury News publishes the first of three excerpts from Bob
Woodward's "The Commanders." This installment goes behind the scenes at the
White House during three crucial days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It
reveals that Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was
stunned when he learned, by watching television, that President Bush had
significantly raised the stakes in the crisis by deciding to drive Iraq from
Kuwait.

<TEXT>     Scowcroft told Bandar that he was speaking for the president. The Bush
position was that the United States was inclined to help the Saudis defend
themselves in any way possible.;    Bandar was wary. He reminded Scowcroft
that only a decade before, when the shah of Iran had fallen from power,
President Carter had told the Saudis, let me send a couple of squadrons of
F-15s to Saudi Arabia as a gesture of support. King Fahd had agreed. When the
planes were in the air, halfway over, Carter announced they were unarmed. The
Saudis had been devastated, Bandar said, and the memory lived on.;    At that
moment, President Bush dropped into Scowcroft's office.;    Bush said he was
upset that Kuwait had not asked for help from the United States apparently
until just before Iraq invaded. He was scared that the Saudis, who might be
next on Saddam's list, would ask too late and that the United States would not
be able to help.;    What sort of help can be provided? Bandar asked. How many
aircraft? What sort of weapons? King Fahd would have to know precisely.;   
Bush and Scowcroft said they didn't have those answers. Secretary of Defense
Richard B. Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin L. Powell
would have to provide them.;    Scowcroft immediately called Cheney and said
that the president wanted to help the Saudis. "Get Bandar in and brief him on
what we can do for him." Show him the best we have, Scowcroft said, referring
to Operations Plan 90-1002, the U.S. military's contingency for defending
Saudi Arabia.;    Cheney had known Prince Bandar for years and liked him. He
was intrigued that a mere ambassador was able to have such a wide impact in
the U.S. government, Washington and the world; Bandar also acted as the de
facto Saudi connection with England's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the
Soviets and the Chinese.;    When Bandar arrived in Cheney's third-floor
Pentagon office later that afternoon, he took a seat at a small round
conference table with Cheney and Powell. Paul Wolfowitz, the undersecretary of
defense for policy, and National Security Council (NSC) Middle East expert
Richard Haass also joined them.;    "The president has instructed me to brief
you on what the United States can do to help the kingdom defend itself,"
Cheney told the ambassador. Cheney knew that Bandar was about to leave for
Saudi Arabia to speak directly to the king; he wanted to make sure Bandar
received the message loud and clear.;    Cheney and Powell produced copies of
top-secret satellite overhead photographs and pointed out the three Iraqi
armored divisions that had carried out the initial thrust into Kuwait. One
division -- about 10,000 troops and several hundred tanks -- was moving
through Kuwait in the direction of the Saudi border.;    Powell launched into
a 10-minute summary of Operations Plan 90-1002, noting that it included more
than four U.S. divisions, three aircraft carriers and many air-attack
squadrons. He allowed Bandar a peek at the large book containing the
top-secret plan and charts showing how the forces would be deployed over the
coming months. "That's a rather large force," Powell said.;    "How many are
you talking about?" Bandar asked.;    Powell said 100,000 to 200,000.;   
Bandar let his breath out audibly. "Well, at least this shows you're
serious.";    Bandar said he favored the plan. He promised to advocate an
immediate U.S. deployment when he briefed the king and his father, the Saudi
defense minister.;    When Bandar called King Fahd to report on the meeting,
he was blunt. The threat was genuine, he told the king. The satellite photos
showed it.;    "Have you seen -- with your own eyes -- have you seen the
overheads?" Fahd asked.;    "Yes sir.";    "Then tell them to come and bring
the overheads."; WORRYING ABOUT THE SAUDIS;    THE NEXT morning, Saturday,
Aug. 4, Cheney, Powell, Wolfowitz and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the
commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, flew by helicopter to Camp David
to brief the president on the U.S. military options.;    "The Saudis worry
whether we're really serious," Scowcroft told them.;    "My worry about the
Saudis," Bush said, "is that they're going to be the ones who are going to bug
out at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in Kuwait. We should be
asking them how committed they are.";    "This is all designed to be
attractive to the Arab League," Scowcroft said. Arab League meetings were
generally designed for the purpose of showing Arab unity, kissing and making
up. "Kuwait is not popular among the Arabs," Scowcroft added.;    "That's why
our defense of Saudi Arabia has to be our focus," Bush finally said.; MAKING
THE PITCH TO A NERVOUS KING;    THAT afternoon, the president called the Saudi
king. Saddam was piling up forces near the king's border, Bush told Fahd. The
Saudis had to act.;    Fahd said Saudi Arabia did not need ground troops to
defend itself. The Saudis only needed help with air power and perhaps some
equipment. He also said that Prince Bandar had reported to him on the previous
day's briefings from the Pentagon. I understand you are going to send a team
to brief me on the latest overheads and your capabilities to help us defend
ourselves, the king told Bush. "Where's this briefing team you're going to
send?";    Bush did not have the foggiest idea what the king was talking
about. "I did not know you were expecting one, but we'll put one together," he
told Fahd.;    When Powell heard about the "team," he immediately saw Bandar's
hand. The prince had been working overtime. Bush's inclination to help and
Cheney's suggestion that Schwarzkopf be used to coordinate a possible
operation had been transformed into a team to make a presentation to the king.
Powell called it "convenient confusion" on Bandar's part. Bandar had cleverly
moved the two nations into each other's arms.;    Bush decided that Cheney
should head the team if the Saudis would accept him. He was senior enough to
act as the president's personal representative; and as secretary of defense,
he could speak with complete authority on military matters.; LAYING DOWN THE
MARKER;    WHEN Bandar met with Fahd in Saudi Arabia the next day, Sunday,
Aug. 5, he explained again to the king that he had seen the overheads. There
was a debate among the king's advisers. Much doubt was expressed. Bandar said
the king ought to see for himself and he might as well accept Cheney, not some
low-level representative.;    King Fahd finally agreed.;    Scowcroft called
Cheney. "It's a go," he said. Departure time was set for 2:30 that afternoon.;
   Powell didn't get word that Cheney was off to Saudi Arabia until Cheney was
almost in the air. As Powell ran over the events of the past several days in
his mind, he was unable to pinpoint precisely when the president had decided
that this major deployment was what he wanted to do.;    That afternoon,
Powell was watching CNN as Bush returned from Camp David and stepped off his
helicopter on the White House lawn. "Are you going to move militarily?" the
president was asked by one reporter.;    "I will not discuss with you what my
options are or might be, but they're wide open, I can assure you of that."
Bush was clearly angered. "Iraq lied once again. They said they were going to
start moving out today, and we have no evidence of their moving out.";   
Waving his finger, growing visibly hot, he said, "I view very seriously our
determination to reverse out this aggression . . . This will not stand. This
will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.";    "Uh-oh!" Powell said to
himself. The president had now clearly, categorically, set a new goal, not
only to deter an attack on Saudi Arabia and defend Saudi Arabia but to reverse
the invasion of Kuwait. Powell was stunned. He had not been consulted. There
had been no NSC meeting, no debate. It was true that Bush had said the first
day after the invasion that he wanted it to be reversed, but it had not been
set in stone. Now here it was, a personal and emotional declaration.;   
Powell could not understand why the president had laid down this new marker,
changing radically the definition of success. It was one thing to stop Saddam
from going into other countries like Saudi Arabia; it was very much another
thing to reverse an invasion that was accomplished. Reversing an invasion was
probably the most difficult military task imaginable, and Powell, the No. 1
military man, had been given no opportunity to offer his assessment.;   
Powell marveled at the distance Bush had traveled in three days. It was almost
as if the president had six-shooters in both hands and he was blazing away.  </TEXT>
