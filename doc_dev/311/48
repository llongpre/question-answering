   As Germany ended 45 years of division, the
Soviet military chief of staff said the end of the Cold War opens
the road to cooperation between the armed forces of the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev embraced and toasted his American
counterpart, Gen. Colin Powell, at a dinner reception in New York
on Tuesday on the second day of his first visit to the United
States.
   ``We have buried the Cold War and I don't think that General
Powell or I are going to try to dig it back up,'' Moiseyev, 51,
told an audience of about 120 U.S. and Soviet military officers and
New York politicians and businessmen.
   ``There are not only wide prospects for friendship between our
people and the American people, but also wide prospects for
cooperation between our armed forces,'' Moiseyev said.
   Earlier, Moiseyev commented on the possible use of force against
Iraq by multinational troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   He said the economic sanctions against Iraq were working and
that no force should be used in the Persian Gulf unless it was
approved by the United Nations, according to a report in
Wednesday's editions of The New York Times.
   Saddam Hussein ``is finding himself in economic and political
isolation and he can't survive very long that way,'' Moiseyev told
the newspaper.
   But Powell, who joined Moiseyev in the Times interview, said
President Bush has not ruled out any options in the current crisis.
   Moiseyev, his country's first deputy minister of defense and
chief of the general staff, is the highest-ranking Soviet military
officer to visit the United States since Soviet Marshall Sergei
Akhromeyev met with then-Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci in
December 1987.
   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accompanied
Moiseyev from Washington, where the Soviet general arrived Monday
for his six-day visit.
   ``The alliance of our countries lives again in our time under
the leadership of Bush and (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev,''
Powell told the audience.
   He referred to himself and the Soviet general - a former
railroad worker - as ``old soldier Powell'' and ``old soldier
Moiseyev.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Moiseyev visited Fort Drum in upstate New York
and observed the 10th Mountain Division training drill - a battle
exercise once intended to prepare American soldiers for a military
encounter with a Soviet foe.
   The Soviet military leader said he had ``a typical soldier's
lunch meal, and everything was fantastic.''
   ``The very soul of what it is to meet the American military was
what we have accomplished,'' Moiseyev said, adding that he's ``a
little jealous of General Powell, because he's a man who pays so
much attention and does so much for the U.S. Armed Forces.''
   From New York, Moiseyev is to travel to other military
installations in Michigan, South Dakota, California and Colorado.
   In Washington, Moiseyev visited the Pentagon and the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, received a 19-gun salute and met with President
Bush.
   ``In our hearts, we've felt much more than we have seen. In
meeting the average American citizen we felt care, attention,
affection,'' the Soviet general said.
