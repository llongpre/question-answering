   Colin L. Powell, the black general nominated to
head the Joint Chiefs of Staff, credited his rise Thursday to equal
opportunity in the military that, he said, does not exist in all of
society.
   Citing his own nomination and the choice of a woman as first
captain of the cadet corps at the U.S. Military Academy, Powell told
the National Association of Black Journalists: ``Almost all barriers
have now dropped.''
   It remains for all society, he said, to follow the lead of the
military in providing equal opportunity.
   ``If you look at the armed forces of the United States you see
the kind of opportunity for advancement that regrettably does not
exist in every part of our society, even within your own
profession,'' Powell said.
   It was, he said, ``the kind of opportunity that we have led the
way with and hopefully will eventually spread to all parts of our
society. So that achievement, recognition, should be a function
solely of performance.''
   Powell, 52, formerly national security adviser to President
Reagan, was nominated as the nation's most senior military leader by
President Bush last week. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be
the first black in the job.
   Powell suggested to the journalists' group what he said would
have been the best second paragraph to news stories on his
nomination: ``Gen. Powell's appointment would not have been possible
without the sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great
nation in war for over 300 years previously.''
   ``The real story is that yes, I climbed. I climbed well, I
climbed hard and I climbed over the cliff,'' he said. ``But always
on the backs, on the contributions of those who went before.
   ``Your challenge and my challenge is to tell our young people
throughout the land, black, white, whatever coloration, that they've
got to prepare themselves. They've got to be ready.
   ``I may have crossed over and climbed the cliff with the help of
many others.'' Powell said. ``But now that we're on top of that
cliff and looking ahead there are still more rivers to cross, and
our young people have to be ready.''
