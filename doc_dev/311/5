<LEADPARA>  President Bush said today he was reappointing Gen. Colin Powell to a second
term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "I can think of no one more
qualified to lead our armed forces as we prepare them for the challenges of
the 21st century," Bush said.;    Bush praised Powell for his advice and
leadership during the invasion of Panama and the war against Iraq, and said
the 54-year-old four-star general "has been at the forefront of planning for
this critical restructuring" of the military.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUSH REAPPOINTS POWELL AS JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Bush made the announcement before reporters in the Rose Garden, with Powell
and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at his side, and then took questions.;   
The re-appointment of Powell to a second two-year term was no surprise, but
came several weeks after publication of an eyebrow-raising book by Bob
Woodward that described Powell as favoring economic sanctions rather than
military action to oust Iraq from Kuwait.;    Powell declined to comment, but
Bush rushed to Powell's defense.;    "He gave me sound advice, straightforward
advice," Bush said. "I just want to be on the record -- he speaks his mind; he
did it openly.";    "He told me the risks; he told me what was at stake in
terms of human lives." Bush said he was angered with "revisionist" accounts
that suggested he and Powell disagreed on the administration's gulf policy.;  
 "He did what any general officer should do," Bush said.;    "The military
advice he provided to me under pressure . . . was absolutely remarkable," Bush
said. "He has done a fantastic job,";    "I, of course, accept it gladly,"
Powell said of the re-appointment, which is subject to Senate confirmation.;  
 The president was asked about developments in U.S.-Soviet policy. He said
there was progress made in arms control discussions and so there is still a
possibility of a summer summit with Gorbachev.  </TEXT>
