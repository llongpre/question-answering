<LEADPARA>  In Pentagon parlance, the new buzzword for winning wars is "synergy," so Gen.
Colin Powell has ordered 300,000 books to tout his message of battlefield
teamwork.;   Everyone in the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force "must believe
that they are part of a team, a joint team, that fights together to win,"
Powell writes in an introduction to the 80-page publication, which will be
sent to all the military's top officers and enlisted men and women.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While the goal of teamwork in the heat of battle may seem a commonsense
notion, achieving cooperation among the highly competitive service branches
has proven to be a persistent problem. And such rivalries may be exacerbated
as the military's budgets continue to shrink, officials say.;   As chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell is the president's chief military adviser, a
job that can force him to referee among the heads of the services.;   The new
book, titled "Joint Warfare of the U.S. Armed Forces," stresses bringing
together the most powerful forces from land, sea, air and space "in a seamless
fashion, presenting no gaps to the enemy," said Army Col. Pete Herrly, a
special assistant to Powell who helped write the publication.;   "This is a
new American way of war," Herrly told reporters. "Teamwork is designed to
result in 'synergy,' which means the whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.";   Powell ordered the book to be drafted shortly after the end of
Operation Desert Storm. It includes quotes from many of Desert Storm's
commanders, who sing its praises as a good example of military cooperation.;  
Vice Adm. Stanley Arthur, the Navy's top commander in the gulf war, is quoted
as saying, "What carried the day was that we, the component commanders, shook
hands and said, 'We're not going to screw this up, we're going to make it
work.' And it did.";   The book is sprinkled with maps and photos of past U.S.
commanders who overcame the frictions of warfare to achieve victory. One
section is devoted to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's massive combination of forces
for the Normandy invasion, contrasted to "the fragmented Germany command
structure.";   Absent from the book, however, are examples of U.S. military
operations that suffered from a lack of cooperation, such as the seizure of
Grenada.  </TEXT>
