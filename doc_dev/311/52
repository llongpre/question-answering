   The Senate Armed Services Committee on
Wednesday unanimously approved Gen. Colin L. Powell, President
Bush's nominee to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The panel voted 20-0 to recommend the nomination to the full
Senate. If confirmed, the 52-year-old Powell would be the first
black and the youngest officer to hold the nation's top military job.
   The committee decision followed nearly three hours of a
confirmation hearing in which Powell told Congress that cuts in the
Bush administration's budget request for various weapons programs
could undermine a U.S.-Soviet pact on reducing strategic arms.
   Powell, who served as President Reagan's national security
adviser, told lawmakers that political changes in the Soviet Union
should not lead to cuts in the Star Wars program, land-based nuclear
missiles or the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The House bill that cuts $502 million from the administration's
$1.1 billion request for the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX
missile and eliminates all $100 million earmarked for the
single-warhead, truck-mobile Midgetman ``would completely unhinge
our START negotiating position,'' Powell said.
   His remarks came one day after Secretary of State James A. Baker
III announced a shift in the U.S. position on the land-based
missiles. The administration will no longer insist on elimination of
mobile missiles, according to Baker, who conceded the position has
complicated negotiations.
   The Soviets have two mobile missiles while the administration is
asking Congress to fund the MX and Midgetman.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will meet with
Bush on Thursday before traveling to Wyoming for sessions with Baker
this weekend.
   During nearly three hours of questioning, Powell told the
committee that scaling back the program to build 130 stealth
bombers, considered the most expensive plane in history at $530
million a copy, would force the United States to go rethink its
position.
   ``If there is no B-2, we have essentially started a phase-out.
... Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that
we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said.
   ``We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a
different type of treaty.''
   On other issues, Powell said:
   _He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in
response to terrorist attacks.
   _Cuts in troops in South Korea, Europe and other overseas posts
in response to the growing sentiment in Congress for U.S. allies to
share more of the defense burden should not be done unilaterally.
Powell said he was ``very hesitant'' to do it to satisfy current
budget demands.
   Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, is
commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga. He was
hailed by Democrat Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Republican Pete
Wilson of California as likely the best appointment made by Bush.
   If confirmed by the full Senate, Powell would succeed Adm.
William J. Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
