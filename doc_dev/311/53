<LEADPARA>  As the war against Iraq enters its second week, U.S. commanders in the field
are expressing concern that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein may be reserving the
bulk of his air force -- and his chemical weapons capability -- for use in a
ground war that may be more difficult than originally assumed.;    "All he's
doing is hiding and not fighting," Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander
of the allied forces in Saudi Arabia, said Wednesday. "And, given his rhetoric
before, we thought we would be in more of fight than we're in."  </LEADPARA>

IRAQ PROLONGING WAR BY HIDING, U.S. SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Essentially, what that does is just require more time to accomplish the
objectives we have set out to accomplish in the first place, but our strategy
hasn't changed," the general said.;    Schwarzkopf's comments are the first
time the American military command in Saudi Arabia has acknowledged that
Saddam's waiting game may succeed in prolonging the conflict.;    Top Pentagon
officials also conceded that Iraq has maintained a significant offensive
capability in the face of relentless air bombardment.;    Ultimate defeat for
Iraq is certain, they said, and allies enjoy air superiority over Iraq. But
they said Saddam still has the ability to control his war machine.;    "We're
dealing with an enemy that is resourceful, an enemy that knows how to work
around problems, an enemy that is ingenious," said Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday.;    Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said Saddam "cannot change the basic course" of the war, however.
"He will be defeated.";    Cheney and Powell, delivering an hourlong news
briefing on the progress of the war, said Iraq's two nuclear reactors had been
destroyed, and that its chemical and biological warfare production facilities
were seriously damaged.;    But Iraq continues to have capability to use
chemical weapons, Powell warned.;    After a week of focusing the air war on
key strategic military targets in Iraq, Powell said the allied effort would
begin to shift to the Iraqi army troops dug into positions in the Kuwaiti
desert. Their removal, and the reclaiming of Kuwait, is the war's ultimate
goal.;    "Our strategy to go after this army is very, very simple," Powell
said. "First, we're going to cut it off, and then we're going to kill it.";   
Military officials acknowledge that their work is likely to be complicated by
Iraq finding ways to undo some of the damage being done. There is in
particular worry that Iraq may be able to rebuild bombed runways quickly,
allowing it to use its air force of more than 700 planes if a ground war
begins.;    "Runways are very, very difficult to take out," Air Force Lt. Col.
Mike Scott said Wednesday at a briefing in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. He said
that raids against airstrips would continue and would force Iraq to "re-patch,
re-patch and re-patch.";    Saddam visited the front line along southern Iraq
and Kuwait on Wednesday.;    The Iraqi News Agency said Saddam's commanders
told him "that because of his (the enemy's) cowardice and fear of combat with
the land forces, the enemy tried to avoid establishing any serious contact . .
. and preoccupied itself, for the benefit of public opinion, with bombing from
high altitudes.";    It quoted Saddam as saying the battle would be decided by
Iraq's superior will power and patience. "It is only a matter of time before
the enemy becomes convinced it has done all it can and that the Iraqis are
determined to confront it and triumph over it," he was quoted as saying.;   
Before the war, Saddam repeatedly said Iraq could outlast the American will to
fight, and he threatened to impose an immense toll in casualties by forcing
the United States into a slow, bloody ground war in Kuwait.;    Cheney and
Powell sought to prepare the public for a longer war by arguing that by going
slow -- bombing Iraqi troops for weeks before attacking them in Kuwait -- they
will save the lives of U.S. troops.;    "We're in no hurry," Powell said. "We
are not looking to have large numbers of casualties.";    But time may prove
to be on Saddam's side as impatience takes its toll on troops in the field and
on an American public expecting a quick and easy war.  </TEXT>
