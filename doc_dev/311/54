<LEADPARA>  President Bush has tapped the Army's No. 2 general, Gordon Sullivan, to lead
the nation's largest service for the next four years, Pentagon sources say.;  
 Pentagon sources have said the post would have gone to Persian Gulf war
Commander H. Norman Schwarzkopf if he had expressed an interest in it. But
Schwarzkopf told Army Secretary Michael Stone some time ago he preferred to
retire on schedule and enter private life.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUSH TAPS NO. 2 GENERAL FOR ARMY CHIEF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush was
expected to nominate Sullivan as the Army's chief of staff. The nomination is
subject to Senate confirmation.;    The 53-year-old general is regarded as the
service's chief architect of its plans to adapt in the new post-Cold War era.;
   The Bostonk native will replace the service's current four-star commander,
Gen. Carl Vuono, who is scheduled to retire at the end of June.;    "He'll
lead the Army from the front, not from behind a desk," the source said of
Sullivan.;    During his 31 years in the service, Sullivan has commanded
soldiers at every level, from platoon to division. He specialized as an armor
officer, saw duty in Vietnam and rose to command the famed "Big Red 1" 1st
Infantry Division Mechanized, based in Fort Riley, Kan.;    Despite his
success as the victorious commander of Desert Storm, Schwarzkopf is also known
for -- and has admitted himself -- a somewhat abrasive approach.;    Sullivan,
who has worked in Washington as the Army's head of operations and planning,
was tapped because of his more diplomatic nature and strong relations with
Congress and the Pentagon's civilian leadership, the sources said.;    The
depth of his knowledge of the Army's structure, and its future needs -- it is
expected to be cut back by more than one-fourth -- was a prime consideration
in Sullivan winning the backing of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as well as
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.;    Like Powell,
Sullivan is one of the few top Army generals who received his commission from
the Reserve Officer's Training Corps, and not West Point.;    Sullivan has
served on the international NATO staff as the deputy chief of staff for
support for Central Army Group in Europe.;    He also served as the Deputy
Commandant of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan.;    Sullivan attended the Army Command and General Staff
College and the Army War College. His awards include the Distinguished Service
Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star,
Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.  </TEXT>
