   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, will travel to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to meet with
the top U.S. field commander and to consult with U.S. and Saudi
officials in Jiddah and Riyadh, the Pentagon said Friday.
   It will be Powell's second trip to Saudi Arabia since President
Bush ordered U.S. troops to the gulf area on Aug. 7 in response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The Pentagon provided no other details on the Saudi trip. Among
the unresolved issues in Operation Desert Shield is the
establishment of a command structure for the multinational forces
in and around Saudi Arabia. Also under consideration is a U.S.
policy for rotating ground, air and naval units to keep the forces
fresh.
   Powell also will stop in Brussels, Belgium, to attend a NATO
meeting and in Paris for talks with his French counterpart, Gen.
Maurice Schmitt, before returning to Washington on Oct. 25.
