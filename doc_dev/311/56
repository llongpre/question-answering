Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. will retire when his second two-year term as chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires at the end of September, defense officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed a report by the industry publication Air Force Times 
that Crowe, 64, was asked by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to extend his tour 
by at least a year but declined. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't formally announced that he's going to retire," a spokesman for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff said. But other defense officials who requested anonymity 
said Crowe -- now on a tour of the Soviet Union -- has decided to retire at the 
end of this term. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Times said some Pentagon staff members are speculating that Cheney 
will urge President Bush to name Army Gen. Colin L. Powell to succeed Crowe. 
Powell served as national security adviser to former President Ronald Reagan.
