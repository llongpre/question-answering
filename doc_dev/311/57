   One of President Bush's top military
deputies in the Persian Gulf said today U.S. troops would not be
ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline
for Iraq to leave Kuwait.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of all U.S.
forces in the gulf, voiced that assessment after a meeting with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Gen. Colin Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, field
commander of the American deployment.
   Waller told reporters the full American deployment would reach
about 430,00 troops by mid-January but that late-arriving armored
units would not be combat ready for some time, perhaps not until a
month past the jan. 15 deadline.
   Asked how he would respond if Bush wanted to order a strike on
Iraqi forces before the full complement of American ground forces
was ready, Waller said, ``I'd tell him, `No, I'm not ready to do
the job.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was
asked about Waller's remarks. ``What he really said is they might
not be as ready as they would like to be ... for all the
contingencies,'' he said.
   ``But we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are
called upon to do,'' Fitzwater added.
   Cheney and Powell told reporters traveling with them that the
United States will be ready to go to war by the Jan. 15 deadline
regardless of whether all reinforcements have arrived and reached
combat-readiness.
   Cheney acknowledged some ground forces on the way to Saudi
Arabia from Kansas and Germany probably would not be combat-ready
by mid-January.
   Waller said he did not anticipate Bush ordering an attack
immediately if Saddam Hussein ignores the United Nations deadline
to withdraw his army from Kuwait.
   ``It's my understanding that he's been briefed and received
briefings that the forces will not be ready for combat activities
until sometime after the 15th of the month,'' Waller said in a
candid, 30-minute session with reporters traveling with Cheney and
Powell on their first joint visit to Saudi Arabia.
   Waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly
that he would oppose any U.S.-led military strike until the full
force was in place. His comments raised eyebrows among deputies to
Scharzkopf and Powell who said they were concerend that Waller had
been too candid.
   ``I would say to the president and to the secretary and to the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that until our full
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate
hostile activities,'' Waller said.
   Cheney and Powell have more strategy sessions Thursday and
Friday morning before spending the rest of Friday and Saturday on
pre-Christmas visits with U.S. troops.
   ``We have an offensive capability should that be required,''
Cheney said. ``Most of the forces will be there by then (Jan. 15),
but obviously there is additional work to be done before you would
identify them as combat-ready.''
   Meanwhile, two senators just back in Washington from visiting
the gulf said they believe, based on talks with U.S. military
commanders, that the United States could conclude a war with Iraq
very quickly.
   ``We believe that with the strategic power we have, particularly
in the air and on the sea, that we should be able to complete the
mission in a very short time,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told
reporters after meeting with Bush.
   ``I think if there is a war, it will be a short one that will
last no more than five days,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   Fitzwater said the senators were expressing their opinion based
on briefings, ``not any conclusion by our commanders.''
   ``Obviously our commanders feel confident about their strength
and superiority in many areas ... but we would be most reluctant to
try and put numbers of days on it,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was Cheney and Powell's third visit each to Saudi Arabia
since Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of oil-rich Kuwait, but it is their
first joint visit and first opportunity to meet together with
Schwarzkopf since he moved his command post from Florida to Riyadh
in September.
   Neither plans to return to Saudi Arabia before the Jan. 15
deadline, and the Pentagon wants the joint visit to convey to
Saddam the administration's willingness to use force if necessary
to free Kuwait.
   But Cheney answered with a blunt ``no'' when asked if his visit
should be viewed as a final planning trip for war.
   On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told NATO
allies to expect a partial Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait as part of
a ``ploy'' to sway world opinion against a U.S.-led military
action.
   But Cheney said the Pentagon had no evidence Saddam was setting
the logistical stage for such a move. On the contrary, he said,
Iraq continues to pour more troops into Kuwait and southern Iraq,
primarily infantry but also some heavier armored forces.
   ``If he is planning to withdraw, we certainly haven't seen any
evidence of it,'' the secretary said.
