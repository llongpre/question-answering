   There will be fewer stars in the armed forces
in the coming years, now that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says
cuts in the military must start at the top.
   Approving a recommendation made by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs of the branches of the
services, Cheney decided to cut 78 generals and admirals from the
top levels of the nation's military leadership.
   The decision would result only in a 7 percent cut in the number
of men and women who wear the gilded stars and braid of the
military's highest ranks.
   The reduction is a far cry from the much larger cuts in store
for most of the services. Army officials have predicted that they
may be cutting one soldier in four from the ranks over the next
five years.
   Currently, there are 1,073 top-level positions in the military _
407 generals in the Army, 338 in the Air Force, 70 in the Marine
Corps and 258 flag officers in the Navy.
   The cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995,
according to Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   At the end of April, there were 2 million men and women on
active duty in the nation's armed forces.
   Williams said the move is part of the Pentagon's effort to cut
back its forces amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened
East-West tensions.
   He said it was only the first of the cuts that can be expected
in the Pentagon rolls, including slots in the department's top
civilian leadership.
   Powell, in a statement released at the Pentagon, said his
proposal reflects the need for economies in the current
budget-cutting climate.
   ``The Joint Chiefs and I believe this plan reflects an
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing
force structure,'' Powell said. ``In light of anticipated force
structure changes, we recognize the necessity for general and flag
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels.''
   Williams said Cheney and Powell wanted to emphasize that it was
appropriate to begin force level reductions ``at the top'' and
among all the services.
   The cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the Army, 27
from the Air Force, three from the Marine Corps, and 15 flag
officers from the Navy.
   A total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of
1991, an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in
1994, Williams said.
   The spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the
numbers through retirement and attrition, but that additional steps
may have to be taken to make the cuts.
   ``I don't think retirement and attrition are going to do it,''
he said.
   Williams said the exact job positions have not yet been
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to
the various services.
   In a related development, the Army announced that it has
proposed cutting about 7,000 civilian jobs. The decision primarily
affects jobs at Army Materiel Command, which is the Army's largest
civilian employer.
   Many such announcements affecting the Pentagon's 1.1
million-strong civilian work force are expected in the coming
months and years, given the Pentagon's current budget cutting drive.
   The personnel announcements came as new chiefs prepared to take
over the top leadership positions with the Navy and Air Force this
weekend.
   Adm. Frank Kelso was being elevated to chief of naval operations
today at a ceremony at the Naval Academy, taking over from another
submariner, Adm. Carlisle Trost.
   Kelso, born in Fayetteville, Tenn., most recently served as the
head of the Navy's Atlantic Command.
   Gen. Michael Dugan, most recently the commander in charge of the
U.S. Air Forces in Europe and the Allied Air Forces in Central
Europe, assumes the command held by Gen. Larry Welch.
   Dugan, of Albany, N.Y., is a former combat pilot during the
Vietnam war who flew more than 300 missions.
