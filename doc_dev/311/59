   The Persian Gulf crisis has altered
the dynamics of President Bush's inner circle, bringing three top
advisers to the forefront and diminishing the role of others.
   Bush's key advisers of the gulf crisis are National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   These are the three men with whom Bush consults over and over
each day as he monitors the Iraqi stalemate _ whether vacationing
here at his oceanfront home or on forays back to Washington.
   All three are old Washington hands with whom Bush worked in
previous administrations _ a familiar pattern for the president.
   Scowcroft is a constant golfing and fishing companion _ the one
aide Bush sees the most frequently at work and at play.
   And, although Scowcroft has told friends he sometimes has
trouble keeping track of the names of the first family's multitude
of grandchildren, insiders says he has in recent months evolved
into almost an auxiliary member of Bush's family _ and possibly his
most trusted adviser.
   By contrast, Chief of Staff John Sununu, who in other times is
constantly at Bush's side, has faded into the background in recent
days. Sununu's strong suit has always been domestic policy, not
foreign or military affairs.
   Sununu's role in the current military and diplomatic crisis has
been so minor that his presence wasn't even needed this week when
Bush returned to Washington for two and a half days.
   He's heading a delegation of White House officials who are in
Moscow helping show Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev how to
administer an executive office.
   Early in Bush's administration, there was speculation that
Scowcroft, a soft-spoken retired Air Force general who was
President Ford's top national security aide in the 1970s while Bush
was CIA chief, was unhappy with his job and wanted out.
   The speculation went that Scowcroft felt a diminished role in
light of the fact that Bush himself was deeply interested in
foreign policy and had made one of his oldest and best friends,
James A. Baker III, his secretary of state.
   However, a Scowcroft departure never came to pass. And today, he
has evolved into an adviser many White House officials suggest is
closer to the president, in some ways, than even Baker.
   Oddly, Baker's role over the past few weeks in the Persian Gulf
crisis has been largely behind-the-scenes.
   Until Tuesday, Baker had been on a vacation of his own in
Wyoming. Administration officials said Baker worked privately to
rally support in the United Nations after the United States called
for a full blockade of Iraqi ports, and to coordinate U.S. actions
with the Soviet Union.
   But otherwise, his profile has been a low one _ while Scowcroft
more and more was the official that the White House selected to
appear on television talk shows to elaborate on gulf policy.
   Baker cut short his Wyoming vacation to meet with the president
at the White House on Tuesday.
   ``He (Baker) is back and you can believe he's not going anywhere
now,'' said one administration official.
   Bush also had a previous working relationship with Cheney and
Powell. Cheney was former President Ford's chief of staff while
Bush was CIA chief. Powell was former President Reagan's national
security adviser when Bush was vice president. The two talked
almost daily.
   Scowcroft ``bridges both worlds,'' serving as an intermediary
between Powell and Cheney, said one key aide.
   While Bush talks with Baker on the phone _ sometimes several
times a day _ he's constantly with Scowcroft. The national security
adviser has an office close to the Oval Office in the White House,
and the two drop in on one another frequently.
   Scowcroft's emerging high profile has much to do with the fact
that the U.S. operation in the gulf is primarily a military one.
But aides say that it also reflects Bush's trust in him.
   ``Over the past few months, there's a special affinity that's
developed between the president and Brent,'' said a White House
aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Both share the same
kind of philosophy. And over the past year or so, the relationship
has developed a lot closer.''
