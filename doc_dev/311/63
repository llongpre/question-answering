<LEADPARA>  Nearly six in 10 California voters say they are inclined to re-elect President
Bush, but Vice President Dan Quayle is a drag on the 1992 Republican ticket,
according to a new California Poll.;    Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed
say Bush is doing an excellent or good job as president, while 21 percent rate
his job performance as fair and 13 percent as poor or very poor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Reflecting that view, 58 percent of the voters say they are inclined to
vote for Bush and only 28 percent say they are not inclined to re-elect him.; 
  "Quayle's current job performance among Californians is unusually weak,"
said pollster Mervin Field.;    Moreover, by a 65-30 margin, California voters
say they wish Bush had picked another running mate in 1988. In terms of
helping Bush carry California, Quayle trails behind Secretary of State James
Baker, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.;    Half of those
surveyed said they would be inclined to favor Bush if Baker were his running
mate, while 22 percent said they would be less inclined and 28 percent said it
would make no difference.;    In addition, by a 56-21 margin, voters say they
would be less rather than more likely to vote for the GOP ticket if Quayle
were the running mate.;    The California Poll surveyed 977 potential voters
Feb. 7-12. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.;
That's the ticket; Here's how Californians' inclinations to vote Republican
change when Bush is paired with various possible vice presidential running
mates.;                 More        Less        No diff./;
