<LEADPARA>  President Bush today bestowed medals of freedom on Desert Storm commander Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell,
calling them "the men that our heroes look up to.";    In a surprise
announcement, Bush also gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Secretary of
State James Baker, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, who did not know they were to be honored until he
called their names at today's ceremony.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Desert Storm marked the end of an era of self doubt and lingering
uncertainty about America's staying power and sense of purpose," Bush said in
an East Room ceremony honoring U.S. leaders of the Persian Gulf war effort.;  
 Bush also presented Presidential Citizens Medals to eight top deputies from
the National Security Council, the Pentagon, State and Defense departments for
the counsel they gave before and during the war against Iraq.;    Bush made
the presentations before heading for the Black Hills of South Dakota to help
mark the 50th anniversary of Mount Rushmore.;    Bush and his wife, Barbara,
planned to stay tonight in Springfield, Mo., and attend Fourth of July parades
Thursday in Marshfield, Mo., and Grand Rapids, Mich., before returning to the
White House on Thursday evening to view the fireworks exploding over the
Mall.;    It took sculptor Gutzon Borglum and an army of 360 stonecutters 14
years to carve the 60-foot-tall heads of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln at Mount Rushmore.;    Borglum died in
early 1941, seven months before the work was completed. With war breaking out,
there was never a formal dedication.;    So Bush was taking up the task of
dedicating the memorial even as he gave a boost to a drive to raise the $40
million to repair the hundreds of cracks on the granite visages and improve
facilities for the 2 million tourists who visit it each year.;    A flock of
celebrities was expected at Mount Rushmore, and organizers were hoping to
hoist a 120-by-80-foot American flag above the mountaintop from a
helium-filled balloon.  </TEXT>
