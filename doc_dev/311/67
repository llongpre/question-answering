   Cuts Congress is considering in the fiscal 1990
budget for various weapons programs could derail a U.S.-Soviet
agreement on reducing strategic arms, says President Bush's nominee
to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, whose career has spanned two combat tours
in Vietnam to a stint as former President Reagan's national security
adviser, won unanimous approval Wednesday from the Senate Armed
Services Committee to be the nation's top military commander.
   If confirmed by the full Senate, Powell would succeed Adm.
William J. Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
   During the nearly three-hour confirmation hearing earlier
Wednesday, Powell told members of the committee that political
changes in the Soviet Union should not lead to wholesale cuts in the
Star Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles or the B-2 stealth
bomber.
   House legislation would cut $502 million from the $1.1 billion
request for the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missile and
eliminate all $100 million earmarked for the single-warhead,
truck-mobile Midgetman.
   Powell said the House plan ``would completely unhinge our START
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) negotiating position.''
   House and Senate conferees met behind closed doors Wednesday to
craft a final version of the defense bill. According to
congressional sources who requested anonymity, senators rejected a
revised House proposal calling for full funding of the MX missile
and elimination of the Midgetman.
   Powell's remarks came one day after Secretary of State James A.
Baker III announced the administration will no longer insist on
elimination of land-based mobile missiles, conceding the issue had
complicated negotiations. The Soviets have two mobile missiles while
the administration is asking Congress to fund the MX and Midgetman.
   Powell also told senators that scaling back the program to build
130 of the bat-winged B-2 bombers, considered the most expensive
plane in history at $530 million a copy, would force the United
States to change its stance in arms talks with the Soviets.
   ``Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that
we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said.
   ``We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a
different type of treaty,'' he said.
   On other issues, Powell said:
   _He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in
response to terrorist attacks.
   _The U.S. should not unilaterally cut troops in South Korea,
Europe and other overseas posts to convince allies to share more of
the defense burden. Powell said he was ``very hesitant'' to do it to
satisfy current budget demands.
   Powell is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort
MacPherson, Ga. He was hailed by Democrat Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Republican Pete Wilson of California as likely the
best appointment Bush has made.
