<LEADPARA>  The Times of London was politely corrected in a letter to the editor Friday by
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, about why
his friends call him KOH-lin -- not KAH-lin.;    The question was raised Feb.
22 when Philip Howard, the paper's writer on linguistic affairs, wrote in a
lengthy and learned article about the name Colin that "he pronounces it with a
long O, so as to rhyme with bowling. What can it mean?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      "Two things are going on here, I think. One is the American wish not to
put up with elitist British pronunciations. . . . The other factor is American
individuality and the wish to be different in names.";    In his letter,
Powell explained, "My parents were British subjects and they named me Colin
(KAH-lin). Being British, they knew very well how the name was supposed to be
pronounced. But when I was a young boy, there was a famous American World War
II hero . . . whose name became very popular in the streets of New York City.
He was Captain Colin P. Kelly Jr. He was called KOH-lin.;    "My friends in
the streets of the South Bronx, who heard Captain Kelly's name pronounced on
the radio and by their parents and other adults, began to refer to me by the
same pronunciation. So, I grew up with my friends saying KOH-lin and my family
saying KAH-lin."  </TEXT>
