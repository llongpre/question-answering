<TEXT>     Bush said on Wednesday, "there was total agreement in terms of when this
war should end." He announced a conditional cease-fire on Feb. 27.;    Yet,
Schwarzkopf, the allied commander of Desert Storm, had told an interviewer,
"Frankly, my recommendation had been, continue the march.";    Intent on
ending the controversy, Bush called Schwarzkopf today to express his full
support and confidence in the general, Popadiuk said. "The president told Gen.
Schwarzkopf not to worry about this incident" and that Bush "was totally
relaxed about it," the spokesman said.;    Popadiuk said Schwarzkopf probably
had felt awkward because of the spotlight on his remarks. "There is no ill
will on this issue," Popadiuk said of Bush. "He supports him (Schwarzkopf) 100
percent.";    The spokesman said Schwarzkopf was "very pleased and
appreciative" of the call.;    The embarrassing difference of opinion between
the commander-in-chief and one of his top commanders was a jarring footnote in
the triumphant conclusion to the war against Iraq. Whatever his intent,
Schwarzkopf raised pointed questions about Bush's judgment in halting the
fighting before Iraqi forces were vanquished.;    "It's one of those ones that
historians are going to second-guess, you know, forever," Schwarzkopf said in
a public television interview broadcast Wednesday night. "Why, you know, why
didn't we go for one more day vs. why did we stop when we did when we had them
completely routed?";    In a clear rebuke to Schwarzkopf, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney disputed the general's account.;    Cheney said Schwarzkopf and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were consulted on
Feb. 27 and "made the recommendation to me and to the president that we had
achieved our military objectives and agreed that it was time to end the
campaign.";    Further, Cheney said, Schwarzkopf "raised no objection to
terminating hostilities.";    Asked to explain Schwarzkopf's statement, Bush
said, "Go ask him. Go ask him. . . . I have such high regard for Gen.
Schwarzkopf that I'll let him explain what he said.;    "All I'm talking about
is the facts, and Secretary Cheney put the facts out very clearly. . . . It is
totally accurate," the president said.;    The White House sought to minimize
the controversy.;    "It's just one of those Washington flaps," presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, adding that Schwarzkopf was not in trouble.
"Still a good man, just said the wrong thing.;    "He's a great general. He
did a great job. But we want to set the record straight," Fitzwater added.;   
Asked whether the flap would dampen Schwarzkopf's chances of promotion to a
fifth star, Fitzwater replied, "That's never been discussed anyway.";   
Fitzwater said that on Feb. 27, both Powell and Cheney recommended a
cease-fire to Bush.;    "The president said, 'Fine, but what does Norm think
about this?' Powell walked over to the president's desk in the Oval Office,
picked up the phone and called Schwarzkopf in Saudi Arabia . . . and asked if
he thought that was feasible and appropriate, and he said 'Yes.' Powell turned
around to the president and said, 'Norm says he can handle it,' " Fitzwater
said.;    In his interview, Schwarzkopf said he had wanted to "continue the
march.";    "I mean we had them in a rout and we could have continued to, you
know, reap great destruction upon them. We could have completely closed the
door and made it in fact a battle of annihilation.";    The general said
Bush's decision "did leave some escape routes open for them to get back out,
and I think it was a very humane decision and a very courageous decision on
his part, also."  </TEXT>
