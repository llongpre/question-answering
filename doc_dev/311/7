<LEADPARA>  If one person embodies the overwhelming domination the United States hopes to
impose on Iraq, it is Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.;    A tall, broad man with a gallery of medals and service ribbons
over his heart, he has projected an image of easy confidence while briefing
the world over the past two days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I hope (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) would quail at the sight, but I
don't think he has the sense to," said Caspar Weinberger, the former secretary
of defense.;    Powell, 53, has been in the public eye before, but as the
mastermind of the massive allied war against Iraq, he is now confronting the
event that is likely to define an extraordinary public career.;    When asked
about Powell, former associates use "most likely to succeed" adjectives:
meticulous, smart, amiable, funny, humble.;    "I've looked at officers and
generals for years and wondered whether they could fight a war," said former
Sen. Howard Baker, who worked with Powell at the Reagan White House. "Colin
was one of those who I knew could. And now we're finding out he can.";   
Powell has not downplayed the dangers or uncertainties of war, but he has
added to the country's early confidence with such comments as his promise
Thursday "to use all the tools in the tool box that we brought to this
effort.";    Both the apparent early success of the operation and his public
performances reflect Powell's mix of military and political acumen and his
ability to talk without spewing a barrage of acronyms that are the Pentagon's
usual defense against the outside world.;    Those accomplishments, plus his
distinction as a black man in a Republican administration, has brought him
repeated mentions as a possible vice presidential candidate.;    Baker said he
recently told Powell he "ought to run for political office. His response was,
'You've already gotten me into enough trouble.' ";    While taking no
political positions, he has taken on a public role, mostly speaking to black
youths.;    "He's a role model for kids," said longtime friend James E.
Bostic. "The things he's done in this country -- particularly as a black
person -- are historic.";    Powell's appointment as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs by President Bush on Oct. 1, 1990, capped an extraordinary ascent by a
military officer, especially a black military officer who entered service
through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.;    Born in Harlem to a shipping
clerk and a seamstress, both Jamaican immigrants, he grew up in New York
City's South Bronx and graduated from public high school there. He majored in
geology at City College of New York and became an ROTC cadet.;    Upon
graduation, he became a second lieutenant in the Army. He did two tours in
Vietnam, sustaining two injuries and winning a Bronze star. When he returned
to the United States, he earned a master's degree in business administration
from George Washington University.;    From there, Powell's career has
resembled a surgical strike on the federal bureaucracy: quick and effective.; 
  As a White House fellow beginning in 1972, Powell worked for Weinberger at
the Office of Management and Budget and the department of Health, Education
and Welfare.;    Powell then quickly climbed the rungs of government, from one
job to another. Powell, who has three children with his wife, Alma, has won
praise as a soldier and as a government administrator.  </TEXT>
