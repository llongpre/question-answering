   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has decided
there will be fewer stars in the Pentagon's firmament and will cut
78 general and admirals over the next four years, it was announced
Thursday.
   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
had recommended that the slots be eliminated, Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said.
   Currently, there are 1,073 such positions in the military _ 407
generals in the Army, 338 in the Air Force, 70 in the Marine Corps
and 258 flag officers in the Navy.
   The cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995.
   At the end of April, there were 2 million men and women on
active duty in the nation's armed forces.
   The move is part of the Pentagon's effort to cut back its forces
amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened East-West
tensions, Williams said.
   The reduction amounts to about a 7 percent cut in the number of
general and flag officer positions, a far cry from the much larger
cuts in store for some of the services. Army officials have
predicted that they may be cutting one soldier in four from the
ranks over the next five years.
   Powell, in a statement released at the Pentagon, said his
proposal had the backing of the service chiefs.
   ``The Joint Chiefs and I believe this plan reflects an
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing
force structure,'' Powell said. ``In light of anticipated force
structure changes, we recognize the necessity for general and flag
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels.''
   Williams said Cheney and Powell wanted to emphasize that it was
appropriate to begin force level reductions ``at the top'' and
among all the services.
   The cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the Army, 27
from the Air Force, three from the Marine Corps, and 15 flag
officers from the Navy.
   A total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of
1991, an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in
1994, Williams said.
   The spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the
numbers through retirement and attrition, but that additional steps
may have to be taken to make the cuts.
   ``I don't think retirement and attrition are going to do it,''
he said.
   Williams said that the exact job positions have not yet been
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to
the various services.
