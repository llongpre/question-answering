<LEADPARA>  President Bush is expected to hear today that U.S. commanders in the Persian
Gulf war want to delay the start of a ground war against Iraq for up to a
month while allied bombers further pound the enemy.;    Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are
expected to deliver that assessment after spending two days in the war zone
getting a report on Operation Desert Storm's progress.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although Cheney steadfastly refused to confirm it, top U.S. military
commanders reportedly told the pair that the best time for a ground war is in
three to four weeks.;    Senior military officials in Saudi Arabia told
reporters that ground units that recently arrived from Europe need more time
to get ready. These forces include M-1 battle tanks, which are designed to
take on Iraq's Soviet-made T-72 tanks.;    Cheney and Powell, who arrived in
Washington on Sunday night, wouldn't say whether they would give Bush a
specific recommendation on the timing of a ground war, but the Senate's top
Democrat and Republican did: Don't send the ground troops until the air war
had done more damage.;    "I think we're seeing now continuation of the
pulverizing by air, which I think ought to continue until we decide that we
can hasten the end by some limited ground action," Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
on NBC's "Meet the Press.";    Public support for the war would fall
dramatically with heavy casualties in a land war, said Dole, the minority
leader.;    He said Bush has time to decide when to launch a ground attack.
"We've got two, three, four weeks in my view before we have to do anything
else," he said.;    Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine,
interviewed on the same program, said he believed "the air war can continue
successfully for quite some time. I hope very much that . . . we can degrade
their military capability and keep down and eliminate the need for American
casualties.";    Complex timetable;  In recent days, U.S. signals about a
timetable for the ground war have grown increasingly complex, with officials
saying publicly that it may be several more weeks before conditions for an
attack are right, but hinting broadly that all is ready now.;    For example,
officials have said repeatedly that the allies feel no pressure to rush into
battle. But they have also said the decision about when to fight turns largely
on how much damage the allies think they have inflicted on Iraqi troops. On
this point, they have given increasingly bright assessments.;    Over the
weekend, officials in Saudi Arabia said that allied bombing has destroyed 15
percent to 20 percent of Iraq's tanks, artillery and armored personnel
carriers in the battle zone. Cheney went further in remarks on the way back to
Washington on Sunday, saying the strength of some Iraqi units may have been
cut considerably more.;    "If you're talking about ground forces, I'm sure
you can find some divisions that may be down as much as 40 percent," he said.
Some allied commanders have expressed hope that the air campaign would reduce
Iraqi capabilities by 50 percent before a ground war is launched.;    Nature
could bog down war;  If allied forces are unable to drive Iraqi troops from
Kuwait before the end of March, the forces of nature could bog down the war
with blinding seasonal sandstorms and soaring desert temperatures.;    The
storms and heat are expected to reduce the advantages of the high-tech U.S.
arsenal and exhaust ground troops on both sides, particularly if they must
wear bulky equipment as protection against chemical weapons. Military
officials have warned that ground and air assaults on Iraqi troops could grind
to a halt for hours -- possibly days -- at a time.;    Although both coalition
forces and the Iraqis would be impaired by the changing climate, the U.S.
central command has been especially watchful of the calendar because of
American hopes to end the war quickly. Weather becomes one factor in a complex
equation of potential delays, which also includes religious and political
concerns, such as Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that begin in
June.;    Delays work against allies;  Joshua M. Epstein, a military analyst
at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that any delays in the U.S.
battle plan -- weather-related or otherwise -- work against the allies by
giving Iraq and opponents of the war time to unravel the international
coalition, possibly by luring Israel into the conflict or by sponsoring peace
initiatives unpalatable to Washington.;    Both Mitchell and Cheney noted that
despite nearly 60,000 sorties flown in the first 25 days by allied pilots,
Iraq still has a fierce military force.;    Cheney said in a news conference
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, early Sunday that he was "struck" by the enormousness
of the Iraqi force. "This clearly was a military force designed for major
combat, a force that had capabilities far beyond those that were used to take
Kuwait," he said.;    But he also said the Iraqi army was nowhere near its
strength when war broke out.;    The allied pilots still have a "target-rich
environment" in Iraq and Kuwait, Marine Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal said in a
briefing in Riyadh.;    Two bridges destroyed;  The allies flew more than
2,800 sorties Sunday, hitting sites in Kuwait and Iraq, including destroying
two major bridges over the Tigris River in Baghdad. Military air-traffic
controllers are so busy, Neal said, that it makes their civilian counterparts
at airports in Los Angeles, Dallas and Atlanta combined "look like kids on the
block.";    In the air campaign, hostile fire downed a U.S. aircraft for the
first time in nearly a week. A Marine AV-8B Harrier, shot down Saturday in
southern Kuwait, was the 25th coalition aircraft lost to enemy fire.;    In
other developments:;    (check) U.S. intelligence officers in Saudi Arabia on
Sunday said they believe the allied attacks have so severely disrupted Iraqi
communications that it takes 24 hours for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
get a message to the front by reasonably secure means.;    Primitive backup; 
"They have backup networks we haven't been able to destroy," one officer said,
"but they're pretty primitive. So they have two choices: Either they take the
chance that we'll monitor their traffic, or they use safer but very slow
methods to get the word from Baghdad to their people in the field. Once the
land battle starts, that won't be nearly good enough.";    (check) At least 75
Iraqi soldiers deserted to allied forces in a 24-hour period over the weekend,
raising the number of prisoners of war in allied hands to more than 1,000,
military officials said. A Saudi military spokesman said deserters continue to
speak of low morale and heavy casualties among Iraqi units.;    (check) The
Iraqi government, seeking to alleviate shortages and curb inflated prices,
canceled all duties on imports and imposed new penalties on shopkeepers
convicted of profiteering.  </TEXT>
