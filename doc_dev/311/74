   Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger formally announced his resignation and again advocated a growing military budget as insurance against possible Soviet aggression. 

   While using the same arguments he employed throughout the Reagan administration's military buildup, the 70-year-old Pentagon chief said there is one new threat to national security: possible deep budget cuts to shore up the reeling financial markets. 

   "I would be worried that by some facile theory, we would try to get the stock market back up to 2600" by cutting the defense budget, he said. 
For the past two fiscal years, Congress has cut the military budget slightly in inflation-adjusted terms. 

   Mr. Weinberger also advanced his theory about last month's stock market crash: "the fact that the defense budget was very low, and of course, the news of my resignation." 
The defense secretary, who is quitting to spend more time with his ailing wife, said he will leave as soon as the Senate confirms President Reagan's nominee to be his successor, National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci. 

   Succeeding Mr. Carlucci as national security adviser will be his current deputy, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell. 
Gen. Powell won't have to be confirmed by the Senate. 

   The cabinet changes mean that only one of President Reagan's original cabinet officers -- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce -- remains in his post. 
Lt. Gen. Powell will be Mr. Reagan's sixth national security adviser and the first black ever to hold the powerful position. 

   Secretary Weinberger voiced support for the almost-completed treaty calling for the superpowers to eliminate intermediate and short-range missiles in Europe. 
He had planned to offer his resignation three weeks ago, but postponed it to avoid creating the appearance that he was quitting to protest the U.S.-Soviet summit being arranged at about the same time. 

   As for future arms control pacts, Secretary Weinberger endorsed the idea of chopping the number of strategic nuclear weapons in half, as long as such an agreement doesn't come "at the cost of injuring in any way strategic defense or our ability to deploy it." 
He was referring to the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, which aims to develop space-based defenses against long-range nuclear missiles.
