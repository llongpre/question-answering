   The Senate Armed Services Committee approved
on Thursday three of President Bush's nominees to top defense
posts, including the choice of Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner to head the
Special Operations Command.
   By a vote of 12-0, the panel sent to the full Senate the
nomination of Gen. Michael J. Dugan as Air Force chief of staff,
Adm. Frank B. Kelso as chief of Naval Operations and the selection
of Stiner.
   The Senate is expected to approve the choices without dissent.
   The nomination of Stiner got caught up in a debate between
Congress and the Defense Department over the role of Special
Operations in intelligence gathering and civilian oversight of the
elite unit formed in April 1987.
   ``It may well be that this senator feels that that issue is
going to have to be resolved prior to such time as this committee
completes the work on your nomination,'' Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said
last month at Stiner's confirmation hearing.
   Warner and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, also
expressed concerns about a proposal calling for elimination of
civilian oversight of intelligence activities by Special Operations.
   Gen. James J. Lindsay, commander of the Special Operations
Command, made the proposal in a memorandum to Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Warner said he raised his
concerns over the participation of the head of Special Operations
in intelligence gathering and the issue has ``now been resolved.''
   ``I spent a considerable amount of time analyzing this
nomination not only in terms of the individual, but the general
oversight of this important and vital segment of security forces,''
Warner said.
   The Republican senator also sought _ and received _ a letter
from Powell describing the reasons for Stiner's nomination.
   In the end, Warner joined with other lawmakers in voting for the
nomination.
