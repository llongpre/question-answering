<LEADPARA>  In the end, neither a last-minute plea from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
nor concessions from Iraq deterred the Bush administration from its secret,
days-old plan to launch the ground war Saturday night.;    The time and date
were selected nearly two weeks ago, when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a
whirlwind visit to the Persian Gulf region and conferred on Feb. 11 with
President Bush in the White House's living quarters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Operation Desert Storm, had told
Cheney and Powell that 8 p.m. EST -- 5 p.m. PST -- Feb. 23 was the "ideal
time" to commence the biggest armored clash since World War II, national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft said Sunday. Bush soon agreed.;    Bush and
his advisers could not have foreseen the diplomatic developments that would
captivate the world's attention during the next 12 days.;    As it turned out,
administration officials said, these remarkably had no effect on the war's
timetable.;    Powell recommended the deadline as a way to signal the allies
that the start of the ground war was imminent, Fitzwater said.;    The
high-noon ultimatum was delivered Friday morning by Bush in the Rose Garden,
but there was little expectation that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would
comply with an unconditional withdrawal.;    Before Bush left a few hours
later for Camp David, he told Fitzwater he planned to return to the White
House the next evening to announce the start of the ground war.;   
Administration officials said Bush could have called off the assault Saturday
if he had misgivings or suddenly was convinced that Saddam would pull out on
U.S. terms.;    But the U.S. president did not have second-thoughts, and the
Iraqi president did not oblige.  </TEXT>
