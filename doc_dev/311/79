   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to extend a military exchange program to help eliminate the
``atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust'' between the two countries,
a Soviet official said Thursday.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, Soviet first deputy minister of defense,
and his American counterpart, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced the agreement, signed earlier this
week.
   It extends a program of goodwill exchanges between the two
superpowers until 1992. The previous agreement, which included
visits by U.S. and Soviet navy ships to Vladivostok and San Diego,
respectively, expires this year.
   ``The plan include a wide range of military exchanges,'' said
Moiseyev, speaking through an interpreter. ``I do hope that the
result of that mutual exchange program will give us the possibility
to get to know each other much better. And of course we do plan to
carry on the military exchanges which will be instrumental in
eliminating the atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust.''
   Powell said improved relations between the former Cold War
rivals had already opened new avenues of trust.
   ``Obviously we both protect that information which we believe is
classified (and) is essential to our national security,'' Powell
said. ``What is impressive is the degree of openness that now
exists where we can share information with each other that a year
or two ago we never would have thought of sharing.''
   The two generals made their remarks following a tour of two U.S.
Navy vessels, including a nuclear-powered attack class submarine,
at the North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego.
   Moiseyev, who is on a five-day tour of the United States, is
expected to travel to Washington on Friday with Powell to hold a
joint news conference.
   The Soviet general said he was pleased with the welcome he had
received at American military bases.
   ``I was especially deeply impressed by the degree of openness,
by the degree of unlimited and open desire to tell us, the members
of the military delegation, about their military hardware,''
Moiseyev said of his American hosts.
