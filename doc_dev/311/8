<HEAD>Gen. Colin L. Powell `Never Gets Rattled,' Associates Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gen. Colin L. Powell, in line to become the
first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is a man of
exceptional judgment who ``never gets rattled,'' associates say.
   Bush administration sources said the president was expected to
nominate Powell today to become the nation's top military officer.
The position would require Senate confirmation.
   Powell, 52, the former White House national security adviser, is
credited with helping restructure the National Security Council
following the Iran-Contra scandal. He now heads the U.S. Army
Forces Command at Fort MacPherson Ga., which is charged with
keeping U.S. troops ready for combat.
   The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell is the fourth black to
achieve the rank of four-star general.
   ``He is a person of exceptional judgment and intellect,'' said
Charles Duncan, deputy defense secretary under President Carter,
said in November 1987 when Powell was named to succeed Frank
Carlucci as national security adviser.
   Gen. P.X. Kelley, who worked with Powell in the Pentagon before
retiring as Commandant of the Marine Corps, once described him as
``a very extraordinary guy.''
   ``He can handle stress extremely well. He never gets rattled. He
was always a cool head,'' Kelley said.
   And Carlucci has said, ``I think he should go to the very top of
the military establishment _ up to and including chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   A tall, husky man, Powell collects and repairs old Volvos in his
spare time. He also visits groups of young blacks to tell them of
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil
rights movement.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   He speaks without bitterness of the occasional racial harassment
he suffered during the mid-1960s as a young officer at Fort
Benning, Ga., friends say. He distinguished himself as the best
infantry instructor at Benning, and in Vietnam won a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart. He also has received the Distinguished Service
Medal and the Legion of Merit.
   The watershed in his career may have been a White House
fellowship he won in 1972. He was assigned to the Office of
Management and Budget where he worked for Caspar Weinberger and
Carlucci.
   Later, as military assistant to Defense Secretary Weinberger,
Powell was intimately involved in the 1983 Grenada invasion and the
Libyan bombing of 1986.
   Powell then commanded a corps in Germany and refused several
requests to become Carlucci's deputy national security adviser. He
finally gave in to a personal appeal by President Reagan and
explained in January 1987, ``I'm a serviceman, a soldier, and it
looked like my service might be of greater use here.''
   Powell came under scrutiny in the Iran-Contra affair because he
was one of the few people who knew about the secret sale of arms to
Iran. However, it did not hurt his reputation and he was never
accused of wrongdoing.
   A congressional source, who spoke in 1987 on condition of
anonymity, said Powell opposed the arms sales, ``but when the
decision was made by the president (Reagan), he executed it.''
   In a speech last November, Powell was cautious about prospects
for change in the Soviet Union, arguing against a ``help
Gorbachev'' policy at a conference organized by the American Stock
Exchange.
   ``Will perestroika ... lead to a kinder, gentler Soviet Union?''
he said. ``...We cannot forget that our overall relationship
continues to be both competitive and adversarial. This is unlikely
to change within our lifetimes.''
   Powell met his wife, Alma, on a blind date in 1962, and they
have two daughters and a son.
