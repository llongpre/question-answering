   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of the Soviet
general staff, was welcomed to the Pentagon with a 19-gun salute
Monday and told his hosts, ``We want every chance to get to know
America.''
   Moiseyev, who is the personal guest of Army Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will tour military bases in
five states before returning to the Pentagon on Friday for a news
conference.
   The Soviet general, who has been quoted as saying he is helping
the United States with data on Soviet weapons given Iraq, went
first to Powell's office for photographs.
   ``We've left a very good picture for the history books,'' the
Soviet general said as the flash units flared.
   Powell escorted Moiseyev to the office of Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney for a visit, then led him to the meeting room used by the
military chiefs for private talks.
   Following a private lunch, he helped lay a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery before beginning talks
on Capitol Hill with congressional leaders.
   Over the week Moiseyev, 51, will visit Army, Air Force, Navy and
Marine Corps units in New York, Michigan, South Dakota, California
and Colorado.
   Moiseyev, who is also first deputy minister of defense, is the
highest ranking Soviet military officer to visit the United States
since Soviet Marshall Sergei Akhromeyev met with Frank C. Carlucci,
then secretary of defense, in December 1987.
   The current visit is another sign of warming relations between
Washington and the government of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Moiseyev was appointed chief of the Soviet general staff
following Akhromeyev's retirement. He previously received public
attention by calling for improved technical training for officers
and improved military discipline.
   In an interview with the Washington Post immediately before his
departure for the United States, Moiseyev warned that a military
conflict in the Persian Gulf could escalate into world war and
urged the United States to seek a political solution under the
auspices of the United Nations.
   He predicted that in any conflict with the United States and its
allies, Iraq would be joined by its old enemy, Iran.
   And he said he was personally involved in assembling for the
United States information about Soviet weapons provided to Iraq.
   In the interview, Moiseyev also offered assurances that the
Kremlin has withdrawn nuclear warheads from regions of ethnic
unrest to ``a more secure place.''
