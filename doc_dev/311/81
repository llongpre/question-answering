FT  13 AUG 93 / Clinton opens new front with forces: A military leader more
in step with president

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's relations with the US military establishment
started out on the wrong foot, with controversy over his avoidance of
service in Vietnam. They went rapidly downhill when he became embroiled in
the passionately argued debate over whether homosexuals should be allowed to
serve in the armed forces.
But with the nomination of General John Shalikashvili, Nato's Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, as next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr
Clinton has the opportunity to start afresh in a relationship that poses far
more substantial problems, in a period when the armed forces face
simultaneously a large reduction in their size and a sweeping change in
their missions.
The present incumbent, Gen Colin Powell, has turned the joint chiefs
chairmanship, the top post for a US military officer, into such a high
profile position that it is widely assumed he will step quickly into the
political arena, possibly as a candidate for president, or at least for New
York governor. However, no one seems absolutely sure which party he votes
for.
Gen Shalikashvili was born in Poland, so he is constitutionally barred from
moving on to the presidency. But he has already made it clear that he sees a
limit to the responsibilities of his office.
'I have just been nominated for the position of chairman, not president of
the United States,' he remarked this week, laughing off a question on
whether Russia and Ukraine should be brought into Nato.
Now 57, Gen Shalikashvili fled Poland at the age of eight and came to the US
at 16, settling in Peoria, the archetypal midwestern town. He learnt English
from watching John Wayne films, but has not wholly lost his Polish accent.
Although he comes from a military family - his father was a Georgian army
officer and his grandfather a general under the Tsars - he was drafted into
the US army, before taking a commission as an artillery officer.
He served in Vietnam, and took command of Operation Provide Comfort, the
humanitarian operation in Kurdistan that some have seen as a prototype for
new military missions after the end of the cold war.
The first indications are that Gen Shalikashvili will be far more amenable
to some of Mr Clinton's suggestions than Gen Powell has been.
Firmly committed to the 'Base Force' plan prepared under President George
Bush, Gen Powell has appeared to resist the new administration's efforts to
cut the defence budget more quickly.
He has also been downright obstructive to the president's desire to allow
military service by gays - forcing Mr Clinton to accept a compromise that
falls far short of his earlier commitments - and is understood to have been
a voice of caution against military engagement in Bosnia.
Gen Shalikashvili says he finds the new policy on homosexuals quite
acceptable. On Bosnia, however, he seems likely to bring a different point
of view.
He has criticised the US for failing to take the lead at an earlier stage in
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, and has shown himself to be much less
worried than some other military leaders about the prospect that US military
involvement in Bosnia could lead the country into a Vietnam-style quagmire.
'We are not fighting a first rate, fully combat-capable outfit like we have
been preparing for for I don't know how many years. Never underestimate the
mess and the nastiness you get into, but I think we have had too much
overestimating,' he said recently.
This week, Gen Shalikashvili said he hoped it would not prove necessary to
use force in Bosnia, but warned the Serbs not to understimate US readiness
to bomb them should the siege of Sarajevo not be loosened.
From his Saceur experience, however, Gen Shalikashvili is unlikely to accede
to calls for any acceleration in the reduction in US forces. He has voiced
concern about its impact on morale.
