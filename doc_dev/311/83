   The Soviet military chief urged the
United States Tuesday to match sharp cuts in troops, weapons and
spending Moscow is making as part of its plan to reshape the Soviet
Union's defense policy.
   The call by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev followed comments by Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
cautioning that Soviet forces remain predominant in Europe but
praising Moscow's policy change. Powell also held out the
possiblity of U.S. troop cuts, saying there was ``nothing
sacrosanct about the number of American troops stationed in
Europe.''
   The military chiefs' statements came on the opening day of a
three-week bargaining session designed to ease East-West tensions
in Europe.
   The talks, known as the military doctrine seminar, have
coincided with removal of hard-line leaders in every Warsaw Pact
country. Western experts are eager to learn how the political
reforms that have occurred in Easter Europe since last year might
affect those country's defense policies.
   The session marks the first time the top brass of 35 nations
have sat down to try to lift some of the secrecy surrounding
military affairs.
   Moiseyev explained Moscow's change from offensive to defensive
strategy, and urged the United States and its allies to make
similar military cuts.
   ``We need reciprocity and would like to see it in the nearest
future,'' Moiseyev said.
   Earlier, Powell said the Western allies were still concerned
about ``the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed,
trained and suited for offensive ground operations.''
   But Powell welcomed the change in Soviet strategy and added:
``There is nothing carved in stone that says that military power in
a divided Europe should remain as it has over the last four
decades.''
   The U.S. has about 300,000 troops stationed in Europe, compared
with about 575,000 Soviet troops, according to U.S. figures.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization maintains its forces are
the minimum needed to defend against _ not launch _ an attack.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about a year ago announced
plans to cut unilaterally all Soviet military forces by 500,000
troops and reduce conventional, or non-nuclear, arms substantially.
   Moiseyev said half the reductions have occurred and the rest
will be carried out this year.
   As of Jan. 1, he said, total Soviet armed forces were pared by
265,000. He said 9,320 tanks, more than 5,050 artillery systems and
835 warplanes have been pulled out of Europe.
   The Soviet military budget was cut by 8.2 percent last year and
will be slashed by more than 14 percent over the next two years, he
said.
   ``We also intend, if the situation permits, to drastically, by
1.5 to 2 times, reduce the share of the national income's spending
on defense by 1995,'' he said.
   Arms production will go down nearly 20 percent, he said.
   Sir David Craig, chief of the British defense staff, described
Moiseyev's talk as ``very interesting'' but said he didn't find
much new in it.
   Craig said the West wanted to believe the Soviet intention to
change its military policy.
   ``But there is a long way to go between intentions and
execution,'' he said. ``We must wait and see how that execution is
carried out.''
   Later Tuesday, the Bulgarian military chief, Gen. Christo
Dobrev, whose country last November removed its longtime ruler
Todor Zhivkov, said Bulgaria has trimmed defense spending and
reduced the number of troops and weapons.
   He said Bulgaria has always followed a defensive posture and the
cuts will strengthen that policy.
   Dobrev was the only East European officer to speak on the
opening day. Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany were on
Wednesday's agenda.
   Gen. Lee Butler of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said Dobrev's
remarks were an ``early indication of where force structure might
be going within the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact countries.''
   He predicted the Warsaw Pact countries would talk ``a great deal
about how they're going to restructure and reduce and change the
character of their armed forces ... in the direction of defensive
(policies).''
