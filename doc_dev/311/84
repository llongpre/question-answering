   A top general's reservations about being ready
to fight Iraq by Jan. 15 could complicate President Bush's campaign
against Saddam Hussein and provide fresh ammunition to critics at
home.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have tried hard
over the last few days to convince the Iraqi president he risks war
with the United States if all Iraqi troops are not withdrawn from
Kuwait by the deadline.
   The threat obviously depends for credibility on Bush being able
to carry it out with the U.S. military machine being assembled in
the Persian Gulf.
   But Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, the deputy commander of
U.S. forces there, said Wednesday they would not be ready to attack
Iraq for several weeks after Jan. 15.
   If Saddam were to think the United States is no equipped to go
to war by then - for whatever reason - would he be inclined to drag
his feet in pulling out?
   Impossible as it is to read the Iraqi leader's mind, his release
of American hostages last week could mean he is taking the threat
of war seriously.
   Sensing another ploy by Saddam or possible backpedaling, Bush
and Baker went on the offensive this week.
   The president said Monday there must be total withdrawal by the
deadline and that the United States would not yield ``one single
inch'' in its demand for a full pullout.
   Baker followed up Tuesday at NATO headquarters in Brussels with
a warning that if Saddam pulled out only partially, the United
States would not spare military measures to force all Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait.
   ``There can be no partial withdrawal,'' the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization foreign ministers said in a statement echoing
Baker's threat.
   Taken literally, Saddam would have to withdraw nearly a
half-million men from Kuwait in less than a month. Logistically,
that would be a monumental undertaking even if he were to begin
right away.
   And yet, Bush and Baker left no room for technical problems.
Their demand is unqualified - all Iraqis out by Jan. 15.
   Logistics affect the U.S. land and sea armada as well, and
Waller said some crucial heavy ground forces probably would not
reach Saudi Arabia by the deadline. He said commanders were urging
Bush to delay any offensive action until the deployment is
complete.
   If Saddam ignores the deadline and Bush wants to order an attack
in the days immediately afterward, ``I'd tell him, `No. I'm not
ready to do the job,''' the general said.
   Waller said he believed Bush was aware of the readiness
timetable but said it would be stressed again in meetings in Saudi
Arabia among field commanders and Bush's top two military
officials, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The Jan. 15 deadline was set by the United Nations Security
Council at the behest of the Bush administration and over appeals
by some members of Congress that diplomacy and economic pressure be
given more time to work.
   The critics drew support from David Jones and William Crowe, two
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs. They told the Senate Armed
Services Committee the sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait needed more time to be effective.
   The White House tried Wednesday to minimize Waller's statement.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that what the general really
meant was that ``they might not be as ready as they would like to
be ... for all the contingencies.''
   ``We are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are
called upon to do,'' Fitzwater said.
   And Cheney's top spokesman warned Saddam today from Saudia
Arabia that U.S. air power will be ready to attack by Jan. 15 -
even if all ground forces are not.
   Pete Williams said not having all ground forces fully ready for
combat did not mean the American-led forces deployed against Iraq
could not initiate hostilities to free Kuwait.
   ``The air part of the force, for example, reaches its level of
readiness earlier than the others,'' Williams said.
   And the three-star officer in charge of Army forces in Saudia
Arabia, Lt. Gen. John Yeosock took a far more aggressive posture
than Waller, saying: ``I'm ready today for whatever mission I'll be
called upon to perform. ... My perspective is, `Saddam get out of
Kuwait or be prepared to face the consequences.'''
   If war erupts, Yeosock said, ``We will do everything in our
power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the
highest up-tempo battle ever recorded.''
   Actually, the general did not seem to be out of step with
Cheney, his boss. On his way to the gulf, the defense secretary
remarked that most of the forces would be in place by Jan. 15,
``but obviously there's additional work to be done before you would
identify them as combat-ready.''
   But in Saudi Arabia, aides to Powell and to Waller's immediate
boss, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, expressed concern that Waller had
been too candid in discussing U.S. readiness and deployment with
reporters.
