<LEADPARA>  Fearful of a congressional stampede on the military budget next year, the
Pentagon is quietly preparing options for deeper long-term spending cuts than
were planned -- cuts that senior administration officials say President Bush
could use to reclaim the initiative on the domestic front.;   The cuts, which
would affect fundamental military programs, including troops, weapons
purchases and military bases, could free as much as $50 billion over the next
five years for use in domestic programs at a time when Bush is under growing
attack by Democrats, who say he has failed to address problems at home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The administration has made no final decision on the deeper reductions,
which would probably require modifying last year's budget agreement, and it
publicly continues to resist cuts beyond the 25 percent reduction in forces
envisioned by 1995 under current Pentagon plans.;   But Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
have ordered a comprehensive review of future military needs that could result
in deeper reductions in troops, warplanes and aircraft carriers, and some
officials said Bush could announce an initiative early next year, possibly in
his State of the Union Message in January.;   $51 billion cut possible;  
Under these cuts, the Pentagon's budget could decline to about $240 billion
and possibly lower, from $291 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.;  
"The pressures are growing on the domestic front for reducing the defense
budget beyond the present plan," said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking
Republican on the Armed Services Committee.;   High-ranking Pentagon and
congressional officials say such pressures have been building in the aftermath
of the collapse of communism, the failed Soviet coup and growing calls for the
Bush administration to give domestic programs higher priority in a
presidential election year. They say these pressures increase the likelihood
that the White House will reluctantly order additional cuts in military
spending.;   "The purpose is to prepare for the worst, but we're not sure the
worst will hit," said a senior Defense Department official. "There's really
nothing authoritative yet, but certainly people here are thinking that
Congress will do something stupid to us.";   Secret reviews;   The reviews are
being conducted in extraordinary secrecy by members of the military's Joint
Staff under Army Brig. Gen. William Fedorochko, deputy director for force
structure and resources, and by senior Pentagon staff members under the
guidance of I. Lewis Libby, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense for
strategy and resources.;   Libby is a top aide to Paul Wolfowitz, the
undersecretary of defense for policy, who is Cheney's senior strategic
planner.;   One possibility under consideration, a senior Pentagon official
said, calls for the Army to cut the number of active divisions to 10 by 1995,
down from 18 now. Under the Pentagon's current plan, Army divisions would be
reduced to 12 by 1995.;   The Air Force would reduce fighter wings to 20 from
36 now, instead of 26 as currently planned. The Navy would pare its carrier
fleet to nine ships from 14, rather than 12, the number specified in current
plans. The Marine Corps, already by far the smallest of the forces, is
shrinking to 177,000 soldiers by 1995, down from 194,000 now, and is not
likely to suffer much deeper cuts.;   Advanced weapons programs, including the
B-2 Stealth bomber, the F-22 fighter jet and the Seawolf attack submarine,
could be canceled or production schedules could be extended. Under other
scenarios, these force reductions would be stretched out through fiscal year
1997.;   Cuts would be made gradually, beginning with $3 billion to $7 billion
in fiscal year 1993, to avoid large, immediate layoffs in the military. Deeper
reductions would come in the mid- to late 1990s.;   "It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out that the political process is taking a look at the
resources available and how to spend them," said an officer involved in the
planning.;   Cheney and Powell face an agonizing predicament. One of their
choices is to stick to their existing plan, resist congressional efforts to
make further reductions and risk lawmakers' dictating additional cuts to them
in next year's budget process.;   Or they can take the initiative by combining
cuts in forces with further reductions in two areas that are sacred to
lawmakers -- military bases and reserve troops, such as the National Guard.;  
Sharing the pain of cuts;   In this way, they would force Congress to share
the pain, and they would retain some control over the size and shape of the
military. Pentagon officials say they do not like this approach because they
fear that ceding some cuts to Congress would only whet lawmakers' appetite to
pare more.;   "Dick Cheney and Colin Powell know how to read the political tea
leaves, and everything says the budget has to come down faster than their
five-year plan," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a
non-partisan research organization Washington.;   For now, though, Cheney's
marching orders are to stand firm. He continues to emphasize that the
Pentagon's current reductions will take the military to its lowest troop
levels since 1950 and that military spending will be about 3.6 percent of the
gross national product. As a proportion of the nation's total output of goods
and services, it would be the lowest level of military spending since 1939.;  
In a number of recent speeches, Cheney has stepped up criticism of people who
are clamoring for deeper cuts, warning that such reductions could hurt
training and readiness and could force the Pentagon to dismiss thousands of
troops.;   Cheney has saved his sharpest barbs for Congress, openly voicing
frustration with lawmakers who insist on deeper military cuts but who balk at
closing bases, trimming the National Guard and shutting down weapons plants in
their home districts.;   "The choices we're making aren't about jobs back home
in the district, it isn't about the economic impact of the defense budget,
it's not about how much pork a congressman's able to deliver for the voters
back home on election day; it's preparation for the next time we go to war,"
Cheney said.  </TEXT>
