   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Tuesday the Pentagon has no evidence that Saddam Hussein is
planning any withdrawal of troops from Kuwait and is instead
pouring additional infantry into the occupied emirate.
   Cheney was asked about comments Monday by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that Saddam might try a ``ploy'' like a partial
withdrawal just before the United Nations's Jan. 15 deadline to
quit Kuwait. He said he did not rule out such a move but said
Iraq's military maneuvering indicated no pullout was in the offing.
   The defense secretary, en route to Saudi Arabia to discuss with
ground commanders U.S. contingency plans for war, said the
administration's resolve to restore Kuwait would not melt if Saddam
gave up some of the conquered territory.
   ``If he is planning to withdraw, we certainly haven't seen any
evidence of it,'' Cheney told reporters traveling with him before
his plane landed to refuel at Shannon, Ireland.
   ``He might move the pieces around on the board but our objective
is for him to get all of that stuff out of Kuwait, not half of it,
not 75 percent of it, not 10 percent of it - all of it'' Cheney
said.
   Cheney was accompanied by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, on their first joint visit to Saudi Arabia.
   The Cheney-Powell trip begins with two days of military strategy
sessions in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where the two will meet
with American commanders and ranking Saudi officials, including
King Fahd. Cheney and Powell then plan to split up for two days of
pre-Christmas visits with some of the 270,000 American troops in
the Persian Gulf region.
   Cheney and Powell conceded some of the reinforcements the United
States is sending won't make it there by Jan. 15, and that some
will arrive but still not be ready for combat, perhaps not for
weeks after the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Yet Cheney insisted ``we have an offensive capability should
that be required.''
   ``Most of the force will be there by then but obviously there is
additional work to be done before you would identify them as combat
ready,'' Cheney said, including testing equipment and getting used
to the desert.
   Powell declined to answer several specific questions about the
Pentagon's plans for war, saying he did not want to tip his hand to
Saddam.
   ``I want him to sit there in beautiful downtown Baghdad and
worry his butt off about it,'' Powell said.
   The joint visit will give Cheney and Powell their first
opportunity to sit down together with the U.S. field commander,
Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, and to assess the status of the
U.S. deployment less than a month before the U.N. deadline.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Wednesday
the U.S. troop level has passed the 270,000 mark, and that another
220,000 allied air, ground and naval troops were in the region as
well.
   Williams said the number of Iraqi forces in Kuwait and souther
Iraq continues to grow and now is more than 510,000.
   He said there were concerns raised within the Pentagon about the
security risks of a joint Cheney-Powell trip.
   ``But I think whatever considerations about that are outweighed
by the desire for them to spend some time together discussing the
operation and how things are going, spending some time with the
commander in chief of the operation,'' Williams said.
