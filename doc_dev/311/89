<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that
U.S. military forces in southern Iraq would keep pressure on Saddam Hussein
"for some months to come," while insurrection whittles away the Iraqi
president's power.;    In an interview with reporters, Powell made the most
explicit statement to date by a senior Bush administration official that the
United States will keep military forces in southern Iraq for a long time to
enforce the pending United Nations cease-fire agreement and effectively to
prevent Iraq from smashing a nationwide rebellion with chemical weapons and
air strikes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He said U.S. troops would stay in Iraq until Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other
Arab nations were ready to replace them with their own new security
arrangements, a process that could take many months.;    Powell said he was
surprised at the sustained strength of the Iraqi insurrection.;    "I think it
will go on for a while, and it may be some time before we can tell who has the
upper hand in it. Meanwhile, as long as these insurrections continue, it will
continue to weaken his hold on power and weaken the regime over time," Powell
said.;    "Once these sorts of forces become unleashed, they are not simple to
put back in the bottle," Powell said, "particularly when you no longer have
the kind of cohesive military forces you once had.";    Riots reported in
Baghdad;  According to reports in the Persian Gulf region and in Washington,
the uprising spread Friday to Baghdad, with rioting reported in the capital.
The reports could not be confirmed.;    Meanwhile, U.S. forces Friday shot
down a second Iraqi warplane for violating cease-fire terms.;    The U.S.
Central Command in Saudi Arabia said an Air Force F-15C jet fighter downed an
Iraqi Su-22 with a Sidewinder heat-seeking missile near the northern Iraqi
city of Kirkuk, the site of fierce fighting between government forces and
Kurdish rebels.;    The air encounter was the second such incident in three
days.;    The U.S. military had banned flights by Iraqi warplanes as one of
the terms of a temporary cease-fire that allied forces set after their victory
in the gulf war on Feb. 27, and President Bush has warned that the U.S.-led
allies would down any warplanes that violated the rule.;    In another
development, the Red Cross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, announced an agreement
between the allies and Iraq to release nearly 60,000 Iraqi soldiers taken
prisoner of war.;    The Red Cross said the Iraqi soldiers, held in POW camps
in northern Saudi Arabia, will be taken in batches of about 1,000 a day by bus
to Iraq and released starting today.;    At the United Nations, meanwhile, the
Security Council's sanctions committee agreed to immediately lift a ban on
food imports by Iraq to help mitigate the suffering of the Iraqi population.; 
  100,000 to 200,000 deaths;  The action came a day after the release of a
U.N. survey on war damage that described Iraq as having been "relegated to a
pre-industrial age" by incessant aerial bombings during the six-week war.;   
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that top military officials in the
gulf region have told U.S. officials that their best "wild guess" on Iraqi
battle deaths was 100,000 to 200,000.;    The Bush administration responded to
both reports Friday by blaming Saddam for the massive damage to his country
and saying the United States did not feel guilty.;    White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said: "People are thinking we fought the war decisively, we
fought it well and we fought it as discriminatingly as we could. Were there
thousands of Iraqis killed? Yes. Do we know how many? No."  </TEXT>
