   President Bush is expected to name former
White House national security adviser Gen. Colin L. Powell as the
new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a senior administration
official said Wednesday.
   The four-star Army general would become the first black to hold
the post as the nation's senior military officer.
   Upon confirmation by the Senate, the 52-year-old Powell would
succeed Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is to retire Sept. 30.
   The source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said the White House is expected to make the announcement on
Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the recommendation to the
president and informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday, said
the official.
   The chairman is the principal military adviser to the president
and the secretary of defense.
   Under a new management organization instituted by Cheney, the
chairman also wields greater influence over military budgets than
in the past.
   Bush's decision to name Powell means that the four-star Army
general jumps into the position over several more senior officers.
He would be the youngest to sit in the chairman's chair, and one of
the few not to have attended one of the service academies.
   A leading candidate for the position has been Air Force Gen.
Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
   Powell distinguished himself in the highly visible White House
role and was well known to Bush during his tenure as vice president.
   He has not hesitated to speak to groups of young blacks, warning
them of their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the
civil rights revolution.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   President Reagan tapped Powell for the White House post in
November 1987 after Powell had worked 10 months as deputy to
national security adviser Frank Carlucci to reform the
scandal-wracked office in the days following the Iran-Contra affair.
   Currently, Powell is head of the U.S. Army Forces Command in
Fort McPherson, Ga., where he has been in charge of keeping the 1
million active, reserve and National Guard troops in the United
States ready for combat.
   Powell also served as a chief aide to former Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in 1983-1986 and commanded the Army's 5th Corps
in Germany for six months.
   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx. He was commissioned a second
lieutenant in 1958 after earning a bachelor's degree in geology at
the City University of New York, and later earned a master's degree
in business administration from George Washington University. He
served in the Office of Management and Budget in 1972 during a term
as a White House fellow.
   Powell served in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, and holds
the Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.
