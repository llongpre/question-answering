   The United States will not bow to Iraqi
threats or abandon hostages caught up in the Middle East crisis,
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
today.
   ``We know that it is better to obtain peace by standing up to
aggression early so you don't have to fight a war,''' Powell said
in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore.
   ``We will defend our interests,'' the general said in a text of
the speech released at the Pentagon. ``Don't try to scare or
threaten us. It won't work, never has _ and especially not threats
from Saddam Hussein.''
   Powell added that the United States ``has always come to the aid
of our friends and fellow citizens.
   ``We will not abandon them when they are hostages. And that's
what a guest is who isn't allowed to leave _ a hostage,'' he said.
   Powell, who has played a leading role with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney in planning and executing Operation Desert Shield in
Saudi Arabia, said Saddam should not doubt American will.
   ``All any Iraqi leader needs to do is look at the history of
American valor and sacrifice in the 20th century. There lies all
the proof he needs of American will. There lies all the proof he
needs of the strength of our arms and our fighting ability.''
   Powell said the Iraqi people should wonder ``why their leaders
have squandered their wealth to invade their neighbors _ with
nothing to show for it but world condemnation and the deaths of
thousands of innocent people.
   ``Mr. Hussein, the solution to the crisis is simple. Leave
Kuwait. Let the legitimate government return. Use your wealth for
peace, not war,'' the four-star general said.
   Powell also put in a plug for Bush's fiscal 1991 military
budget, which seeks $307 billion. Both the House and the Senate
have attempted to cut back that figure.
   The general said the current crisis proves that the U.S.
military must remain strong and flexible in order to respond to any
crisis.
   ``Saddam Hussein will pass. America's need for strong armed
forces will not pass _ ever,'' Powell said.
