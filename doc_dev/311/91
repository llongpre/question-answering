   Here is a chronology of the events leading up
to and following the U.S. downing of an Iranian civilian jetliner
Sunday in the Persian Gulf.
   The chronology is based on information provided by the White
House, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. All times are Eastern
Daylight. The time at the location of the incident is eight hours
ahead of Eastern Daylight.
   2:10 a.m. _ Iranian patrol boats fire on a helicopter from the
U.S. guided missile cruiser, USS Vincennes, which subsequently
identifies the gunboats and moves to engage them.
   2:42 a.m. _ The gunboats turn toward the Vincennes at high speed
and are engaged by gunfire from the Vincennes and the Frigate Elmer
Montgomery. Two gunboats are sunk, a third is damaged.
   2:45 a.m. _ Iran says its airliner, an Airbus carrying
approximately 290 people, takes off from the port city of Bandar
Abbas on a flight to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   2:47 a.m. _ The Vincennes detects an aircraft over Iran. The
aircraft heads directly toward the cruiser at high speed and the
Vincennes begins assessing the situation.
   2:49 a.m. _ The Vincennes broadcasts a series of warnings to the
aircraft on both civilian and military distress frequencies.
   2:51 a.m. _ After the aircraft neither replies nor alters its
course, it is declared hostile by the Vincennes.
   2:54 a.m. _ When the aircraft is about nine miles away, the
Vincennes fires two standard surface-to-air missiles. At least one
hits the aircraft approximately six miles from the cruiser.
   3:45 a.m. _ The White House ``situation room'' notifies national
security adviser Colin Powell and other officials of an incident in
the Persian Gulf.
   4:52 a.m. _ President Reagan, spending the weekend at Camp David
in Maryland, is awakened by a phone call from Powell, who tells him
U.S. forces believe they have shot down an Iranian F-14 jet
fighter. Until early Sunday afternoon, the Defense Department
continues to describe the aircraft as an F-14.
   8:11 a.m. _ Reagan is given a written update on the situation.
The update notes that Iran is claiming a civilian jetliner was shot
down by U.S. missiles.
   9:50 a.m. _ Powell's deputy John Negroponte telephones Reagan to
inform the president that it appears a civilian aircraft had been
downed.
   1:05 p.m. _ Reagan holds a conference call with Powell,
Negroponte, Vice President George Bush, Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, Crowe, White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Discussed are details of
the gulf incident and what Reagan will say. Shortly thereafter,
Fitzwater issues a Reagan statement acknowledging that the
Vincennes shot down a civilian jetliner. Reagan expressed regret
for ``any loss of life'' but said the downing of the plane was ``a
proper defensive action.''
