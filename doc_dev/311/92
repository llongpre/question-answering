<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, today rejected calls
for deeper cuts in American military forces and said nuclear bombs will remain
aboard U.S. aircraft in Europe. "I will fight that, I will resist that,"
Powell said in response to demands that the end of the Cold War produce a
larger "peace divided." He spoke before the Atlantic Treaty Organization, a
private group that traditionally supports a strong allied force in Europe.  </LEADPARA>
