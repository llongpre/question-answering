<TEXT>     With tears in his eyes, Schwarzkopf thanked his children and his wife for
their support, then praised the 541,000 troops he commanded.;    "Many are
stepping forward today taking credit for what you did, but you know what you
did -- you made history," Schwarzkopf said. "I shall forever be proud of
you.";    Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell told Schwarzkopf: "The
whole world knows you. They know you because of the story of victory and
courage you have written in the sand, skies and sea of the Persian Gulf.";   
The ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base included Schwarzkopf's final review of
the troops and a 19-gun salute.;    It marked only the latest tribute for the
gulf war hero since his return in April. He has been showered by a New York
ticker tape parade, knighted by Queen Elizabeth, pinned with the Medal of
Freedom, honored by a joint session of Congress and signed to a reported $5
million book deal.;    The 56-year-old four-star general has even hired an
agent to sort out the job offers and possible political opportunities that
await him when he retires at month's end.;    It will close a 35-year Army
career that began at West Point and ranged from platoon leader to corps
commander in Vietnam to architect of the 100-hour lightning ground assault
that vanquished Iraq. His public profile blossomed during his televised
briefings from Saudi Arabia, where his combination of wit and will to win was
beamed to millions.;    Taking over as Central Command commander-in-chief is
Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, the deputy chief of staff for plans,
policies and operations for the Marine Corps. He is in line for appointment to
four-star rank.;    A native of Boston, the 57-year-old Hoar is a Vietnam
veteran who served as a battalion and brigade adviser to the Vietnamese
marines. He commanded the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit, which participated in
three Indian Ocean deployments and nine amphibious exercises.;    The
MacDill-based Central Command, one of eight joint U.S. commands around the
globe, oversees military operations in 18 Middle Eastern countries.;   
Schwarzkopf announced this week he plans to retire to the Tampa Bay area "for
at least a year" and reportedly will be renting a $420,000 home in an
exclusive golf course development.  </TEXT>
