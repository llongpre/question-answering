   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday he has seen no evidence to
support reports of Iraqi troops pulling back from forward positions
in Kuwait.
   Powell, who is on an official visit to confer with top
commanders in Operation Desert Shield, said he was aware of recent
reports from refugees fleeing the occupied country.
   ``I have no evidence to substantiate them,'' Powell said. ``The
Iraqi forces still remain very solidly in Kuwait in the numbers we
have been reporting all along.
   ``And frankly, I have not seen any evidence of withdrawal.''
   U.S. officials say more than 400,000 Iraqi troops are deployed
in and near Kuwait, many of them in forward defense positions
against possible attack along the Saudi Arabian border and the
Persian Gulf coast.
   Reports by Kuwait refugees recently leaving the country have
indicated that some of the forces were being repositioned to the
north, closer to Iraq.
   Powell agreed to talk briefly with reporters in Riyadh following
meetings with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in chief of
U.S. Forces in the region.
   He also visited with some U.S. troops and was to meet in Jiddah
with senior Saudi onificant competition for the U.S. Postal Service.

<BYLINE>THE TOKYO TUMBLE: Most Japanese Shrugged Off Stock Plunge</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   TOKYO - Japan's economy, dizzied by a $2 trillion loss on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange over nine months, seems to have landed
squarely on its feet. By most accounts, consumers have shrugged off
the vanished assets as easy come-easy go. But it has put a strain
on some corporations, who have had to cope with a drop in the value
of their bonds as well as big paper losses.
