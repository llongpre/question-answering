<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured the
Turkey-Iraq border area Thursday and said he hoped U.S. troops could be
withdrawn from the region "more rapidly than we had expected or could have
anticipated a few weeks ago.";    Powell's remark drew cheers from about 150
U.S. soldiers assembled on an airstrip here, but he did not tell them what
they most wanted to hear: a date for their return home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The visit came as the U.S.-led allied relief effort for Kurds who fled an
Iraqi offensive two months ago appeared to be nearing its goal of returning
most of the refugees to their homes. Since an allied military and civilian
team was deployed in Dohuk, a key provincial capital, last week, more than
100,000 people have poured back into the city, U.S. military officials said.; 
  "I think we're over the hump," Powell said of the refugee situation. He said
those who came down from mountain camps on the Turkish border and decided to
stay at U.S.-organized "transit centers" in northern Iraq were not nearly as
numerous as originally anticipated.;    Most have returned to home villages or
moved inside a 3,600-square-mile security zone set up by allied troops. Of the
450,000 Kurds who fled to the Turkish border in March, only about 8,000 remain
there, authorities said.;    Powell said the United States could offer the
returning Kurds no "concrete guarantees" of security, but said: "If the Kurds
feel secure enough to leave our security zone and go back to their homes, then
that's a significant indication.";    The general strongly warned the Iraqi
government of President Saddam Hussein against attacking the Kurds again.;   
"We have to make it absolutely clear, in every way possible to the leadership
in Baghdad, that the international community is watching, that the
international community will be measuring Baghdad's actions in the weeks
ahead," he said. "It would not be in the interest of the government in Baghdad
to return to this area in force or in an aggressive way which would threaten
these people and cause them to fear for their lives again."  </TEXT>
