   There's no evidence to warrant grounding
DC-10s despite two explosive engine failures within a month, the
nation's top aviation official says.
   ``It's safe to fly. I would fly in the aircraft today,'' Federal
Aviation Administrator James B. Busey said Thursday, less than 24
hours after a Northwest Airlines DC-10 made a safe emergency
landing in Denver with holes blasted in the housing of its
tail-mounted engine.
   For the second time in his first six weeks on the job, Busey
defended the McDonnell Douglas-built DC-10, a workhorse jumbo jet
for about 50 airlines around the world.
   Three weeks ago, another explosive engine failure caused a
United Airlines DC-10 to crash-land in Sioux City, Iowa, killing
111 people.

   Public health officials must prepare now to
meet an expected upswing in youth suicides in the late 1990s, says
a task force that recommends educating more people about the
warning signs.
   In a report released late Thursday, the task force said that
while mental illness is often related to suicide, many young people
who take their own lives don't have a major mental illness.
   ``An estimated one-third of all young people who commit suicide
do not appear to fit the known picture _ suicides occur in loving
and supportive families as well as in disrupted families, among
high-achieving as well as low-achieving students,'' said the report.
   The task force was appointed in May 1985 by then-Secretary of
Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler and held a series of
national conferences on youth suicide.

   A divorce trial to determine the fate of
seven frozen human embryos has ended, leaving the judge to decide
whether a man can stop his estranged wife from using them.
   ``On one hand, this case involves the ageless power of sexual
reproduction. On the other hand, it involves a branch of science
and man's ability to understand and control nature, which is as new
as today's headlines,'' Charles Clifford, attorney for Junior Lewis
Davis, said in closing arguments Thursday.
   Junior Davis, 30, sued Mary Sue Davis, 28, for a divorce in
February. He asked the court to prevent her from using the seven
frozen embryos they created through an in vitro fertilization
program last December. He contends he has as much right to decide
their fate as his wife.
   Davis wants the embryos, stored at a Knoxville hospital, to
remain frozen.
   But Mrs. Davis says she should be allowed to have the embryos
implanted in her womb, arguing they represent her best chance of
becoming a mother. She also contends Davis is asking to acquire a
right not normally given to a man _ the decision on whether a child
should be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate.

   The nation's health officials are scrambling to
contain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases after
years in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as a
public health problem.
   More than 8,400 people have caught measles so far in 1989, and
as many as 25 have died, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``It's not really clear why. It's probably a variety of
things,'' said Dr. William Atkinson of the CDC.
   Lack of immunizations is playing a big part, especially in inner
city Hispanic and black neighborhoods, where many youngsters are
going without the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations they should
receive starting at 15 months of age.
   ``We have to reach the parents and really convince them of the
importance of having the child vaccinated,'' Atkinson said
Wednesday. ``There are publicly funded clinics where children can
receive vaccines for little or no cost.''

   Gen. Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit
politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S.
military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad.
   Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to
become the nation's top military officer.
   ``I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges
ahead,'' Powell said.
   He's expected to win easy Senate confirmation and make history
as the first black and the youngest-ever officer to hold the post.
   Powell, who served as national security adviser in the final
year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, will succeed Adm.
William Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.

   Their motto is ``Be Prepared,'' but some
Boy Scouts say they were not ready for what they found at a rainy
camp-out in Norway.
   Half the 19,000 Scouts were girls.
   ``When we have a Boy Scout Jamboree in the states, it's strictly
boys. We were taken a little off guard,'' said Charlie Hart,
scoutmaster of an American troop for the children of U.S. soldiers
based in West Germany.
   Eight Soviet boys also were among the 2,500 visitors from 26
nations at the Norwegian National Jamboree.
   ``This is first time we have had Soviets at a Norwegian
jamboree, and may be the first time anywhere, since the Soviets
don't have scouting,'' said camp spokesman Per-Olav Lie.
