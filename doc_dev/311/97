   President Reagan said he was saddened Sunday
that the U.S. Navy had accidentally shot an Iranian airliner out of
the sky, but said he would not cut short his July Fourth holiday
weekend.
   ``We don't expect him to come back early,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Reagan, whose statement was relayed by Fitzwater, called the
accident ``a terrible human tragedy.''
   ``I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper
defensive action by the USS Vincennes this morning in the Persian
Gulf, an Iranian airliner was shot down over the Strait of
Hormuz,'' Reagan said.
   ``Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew,
and their families. The Defense Department will conduct a full
investigation,'' Reagan said. ``We deeply regret any loss of life.''
   Reagan defended the U.S. action, saying the civilian aircraft
had ``headed directly'' for the Vincennes while it was engaged in
fighting with five Iranian boats.
   ``The only U.S. interest in the Persian Gulf is peace and this
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible
speed,'' Reagan said.
   The president and his top aides conferred by telephone and telex
throughout the early morning Sunday, with their discussions
culminating in a 1:05 p.m. EDT conference call with top officials,
a briefing by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William Crowe, and the release of Reagan's statement at the White
House.
   But the White House retained its quiet weekend atmosphere.
Fitzwater did not meet with reporters, and an aide said no
briefings were planned until Tuesday.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan flew by helicopter to
the Camp David, Md., retreat in the Catoctin Mountains outside
Washington on Friday. They planned to hold to their schedule, which
was to return to the White House at midday on Monday and view the
evening Fourth of July fireworks from the balcony of the residence,
Fitzwater said.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk, who met with
reporters briefly, said that national security adviser Colin Powell
awoke Reagan at 4:52 a.m. EDT with the news that U.S. forces
believed they had shot down an Iranian F-14 jet fighter. He
received another update in writing at 8:11 a.m. that noted the
Iranian claim that a civilian jetliner had been downed.
   At 9:50 a.m., he was told that the Iranian allegations might be
correct, the spokesman added.
   Popadiuk said Powell flew back to the White House Sunday
morning, breaking off a speaking engagement in Tennessee.
   The spokesman said Powell returned to Washington in time for the
conference call with Reagan and other top aides at 1:05 p.m.,
during which the president's written statement was discussed as
well as the details of the incident.
   Also included in the call were Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
Crowe, White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, Powell's NSC
deputy John Negroponte and Fitzwater, Popadiuk said.
   Powell planned to keep the president updated on the situation
with written statements and telephone conversations, Popadiuk said.
