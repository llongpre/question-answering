<P>
Even before Miami knocked off top-ranked Notre Dame, 27-10, Saturday night, the 
Hurricanes and Fighting Irish accepted bids to New Year's Day bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
However, seventh-ranked Miami's victory over the Irish spoiled the Orange 
Bowl's hoped-for showdown for the national championship between Notre Dame 
(11-1) and second-ranked Colorado (11-0), which earned an automatic berth by 
winning the Big Eight Conference championship outright for the first time since 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said the Irish accepted the Orange 
Bowl bid because they haven't played in the New Year's Night game since 1975. 
Rosenthal said the Fighting Irish also considered bids from the Sugar, Cotton, 
Fiesta and Citrus Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Because the game is at night, the Orange Bowl could still get its showdown if 
things break just right earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado last played in the Orange Bowl in 1977, when it was Big Eight 
co-champion. Nebraska or Oklahoma has been the conference representative at 
Miami every year since. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (10-1) accepted a bid to play the Southeastern Conference champion -- 
either No. 4 Alabama (10-0), No. 10 Auburn (8-2) or No. 8 Tennessee (9-1) -- in 
the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC runner-up, or possibly an SEC co-champion that does not go to the Sugar 
Bowl, will play in the Cotton Bowl against ninth-ranked Arkansas (9-2), the 
Southwest Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Michigan (10-1) joined No. 12 USC (8-2-1), the Pacific 10 
Conference champion, in a rematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena by beating Ohio 
State, 28-18, to clinch the Big Ten Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (8-3) will play the odd team out in the SEC on Jan. 1 in the Hall of 
Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Florida State (8-2), the only team to beat Miami, will play No. 6 
Nebraska (10-1), which lost only to Colorado, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1 at 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Clemson (9-2) will play No. 17 West Virginia (9-2) Dec. 30th in the 
Gator Bowl at Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten runner-up and 11th-ranked Illinois (9-2) and Atlantic Coast Conference 
co-champion Virginia (10-2), No. 16, accepted bids to play in the Florida 
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. Illinois lost only to Michigan and Colorado. 
Virginia lost only to Notre Dame and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl was hoping to invite Indiana and its All-American running back 
Anthony Thompson, but the Hooisers were upset, 15-14, Saturday by Purdue. So 
the game at Anaheim Stadium will have Florida (7-3) and Emmitt Smith against 
Washington (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Penn State (7-3-1) accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29 
against BYU after beating No. 19 Pitt, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
'It won't be 16-13 (in the Holiday Bowl)," Paterno said. "Maybe (BYU Coach) 
LaVell Edwards will take it easy because I'm his buddy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe we'll throw and he'll run," added Paterno, drawing laughter because 
the suggestion went contrary to the teams' offensive philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 BYU (10-2) clinched the Western Athletic Conference championship and the 
automatic berth in the Holiday Bowl that goes with it by beating San Diego 
State, 48-27, Saturday night at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego -- site of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its defeat, Pitt (6-3-1) will play No. 14 Texas A&amp;M (7-3) in the 
John Hancock Bowl Dec. 16 at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-4) will play Syracuse (6-4) in the Peach Bowl at Atlanta Stadium on 
Dec. 30. Georgia and Syracuse each has one game remaining -- Georgia at 
archrival Georgia Tech and Syracuse against Louisville in Tokyo. Both games are 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Michigan State (7-4), with losses to Miami, Notre Dame, Michigan and 
Illinois, won its fifth consecutive game Saturday, 31-3, over Wisconsin, to 
earn a spot in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day against No. 24 Hawaii (8-2) in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-4) beat Mississippi State, 21-11, Saturday and accepted a bid to 
the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 28 at Memphis, Tenn., against Air Force (8-3). The 
Falcons were eliminated from the WAC race and Holiday Bowl consideration by 
BYU's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-4-1), by beating archrival Arizona State, 28-10, on Saturday, will

will face No. 23 Duke (8-3) in the All-American Bowl on Dec. 28 at Birmingham, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (8-2) is on NCAA probation for recruiting violations and is ineligible 
for post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
