<P>
And then there were four. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn's 30-20 victory over previously unbeaten Alabama dropped the Crimson 
Tide from No. 2 to No. 7 in the rankings and left only four teams in contention 
for college football's national championship: Colorado, Miami, Michigan and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado remained on top for the second straight week in today's Associated 
Press poll, and Miami rose two spots to second. Michigan remained No. 3 and 
Notre Dame moved up one notch to No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame each finished the regular season with one loss; 
Colorado is the only undefeated team in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the New Year's bowl match-ups, those are the only teams with a 
realistic chance to win the national title. Colorado plays Notre Dame in the 
Orange, Alabama meets Miami in the Sugar and Michigan faces 12th-ranked USC in 
the Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado can claim the championship by beating Notre Dame. If Notre Dame wins 
and Miami and Michigan lose, however, the Fighting Irish would almost certainly 
be voted No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, which snapped Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak two weeks ago, needs a 
win over Alabama and a Colorado loss to capture its third national championship 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although Michigan is ranked third, it will be very difficult for the Wolverines 
to finish on top. They need an impressive win over USC, a Miami loss in the 
Sugar Bowl and a close Notre Dame victory in the Orange Bowl to have any 
chance. Even then, the Irish would probably get the nod because they would have 
beaten the No. 1 team and because they defeated Michigan 24-19 at the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado received 55 first-place votes and 1,492 of a possible 1,500 points 
from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Miami got four 
first-place votes and 1,407 points, and Michigan received the other first-place 
vote and 1,374 points. Notre Dame's point total was 1,323. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the Top 10 are Florida State, Nebraska, Alabama, Tennessee, Auburn 
and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State, which has won nine straight since opening the season with two 
losses, moved up one place to fifth after beating Florida 24-17 Saturday. 
Nebraska, which was idle, went from No. 7 to No. 6, Tennessee stayed No. 8 
after defeating Vanderbilt 17-10, Auburn jumped two places to No. 9 after its 
victory over Alabama, and Arkansas fell one spot to No. 10 after a 38-24 win 
over Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is 11th, followed by USC, Houston, Clemson, Virginia, Texas A&amp;M, 
West Virginia, Penn State, Brigham Young, Duke, Ohio State, Michigan State, 
Hawaii, Pittsburgh and Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Illinois, which dropped one spot, all of those teams held the same 
position as the previous week.
