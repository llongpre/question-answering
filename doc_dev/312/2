<LEADPARA>  No. 1 Colorado; (box) Orange Bowl -- Colorado (11-1-1) held off No. 5 Notre
Dame 10-9, surviving a scare when the Irish's Raghib "Rocket" Ismail returned
a punt 91 yards for an apparent touchdown with less than a minute left only to
have it called back because of a clipping penalty. Every top-ranked team that
has won a bowl game has been crowned national champion, so it would be a major
break with tradition if Colorado doesn't finish No. 1 when the final
Associated Press poll is released today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   No. 2 Georgia Tech; (box) Citrus Bowl -- Georgia Tech capped an 11-0-1 season
with a convincing 45-21 victory over 19th-ranked Nebraska. The Yellow Jackets,
the only major college team without a loss, also were undefeated in 1952, when
they went 12-0 but finished second in the nation behind Michigan State. This
season's squad hasn't received much respect from AP's voters (a nationwide
panel of sportswriters and broadcasters), and the Yellow Jackets even entered
Tuesday's game as two-point underdogs against Nebraska.;  No. 4 Miami; (box)
Cotton Bowl -- Miami (10-2), the defending national champion, battered No. 3
Texas 46-3. In scoring the most points in Cotton Bowl history and producing
the widest margin of victory, Miami also set a record for penalties (16 for
202 yards). "The only thing they got over Colorado is they have bigger
mouths," Texas tackle Stan Thomas said. Texas Coach Dave McWilliams, whose
team's only other loss was to Colorado, was more impressed. "If they are not
the best, then I don't want to play the best," McWilliams said.;  Bowl scores;
