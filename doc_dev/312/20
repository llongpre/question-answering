SEASON'S INTRIGUING TOPICS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Based on talent, the answer might be yes. In light of FSU's schedule, it's
no -- which is too bad, because the Seminoles will forsake independence to
enter the ACC in '92. Based on the success independents have had procuring
national titles -- Penn State, Miami and Notre Dame are examples -- it could
be said the more control a team has over its schedule, the better.;   The
'Noles are rated No. 1 so far, but they open Thursday night at Anaheim Stadium
against BYU, which knocked off the '90 preseason No. 1, Miami, in the
Hurricanes' opener.;   But the Seminoles return 35 of the top 44 players from
a 10-2 team in '90. And should FSU be undefeated after playing the Cougars,
Michigan, LSU, Louisville, South Carolina, Miami and Florida, it'll be hard
not to give them the title.; 2. Is David Klingler a lock for the Heisman?;  
Right now, yes. Ty Detmer of BYU is back, but he threw four interceptions in a
59-28 loss to Hawaii hours after winning the Heisman last year, then followed
up with an equally stinking Holiday Bowl defeat to Texas A&amp;M. Klingler had 352
yards against A&amp;M and rallied his team to victory. Klingler's team will be
more successful this year, too. The Cougars' defense returns all but one
starter and boasts the best linebackers in the Southwest Conference. Klingler
-- who waited his turn behind Houston's Andre Ware two years ago, and last
season put up record-breaking numbers for a program headed nowhere because of
probation -- will have a coming-out party on national TV against Miami on
Sept. 12. If that's a success, the race will be over before it's run. Heisman
voters view Klingler as long-suffering. They're itching to reward him.;  
store the Bay Area to prominence. They'll need to do well this season and be
followed by guys just like them in each of the next three or four seasons.; 3.
What will be the impact of narrower goalposts?;   The idea of reducing the
goalposts from 23 feet four inches wide to 18-6 is to induce coaches to go for
the first down or the end zone instead of the uprights.;   What effect will it
have on strategy? Not much on schools with great kickers, said the University
of Houston's stellar senior, Roman Anderson.;   But field-goal attempts inside
the 15 from the hash marks will force kickers to chip balls at an acute angle.
Similarly, there will be less room for a ball to curve on long kicks. For
teams with average kickers, the rule could persuade a coach not to bother.;  
"What I still haven't figured out is why they keep picking on the kickers,"
Anderson said. "The next thing you know, they'll want us to wear heavier
shoes."; 4. Can Will Clark replace the Rocket?;   Clark, not to be confused
with the scowling first baseman, is a Notre Dame sophomore from Wheatfield,
Calif., who also won't be confused with Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. Still, Coach
Lou Holtz is optimistic that Clark, a tailback who was switched from defensive
back just this spring, will have a semblance of Ismail's explosiveness.;   ND
coaches have timed Clark at 4.29 seconds in the 40, which compares nicely with
Ismail's 4.28. "Will Clark is legitimately a game-breaker," Holtz said. "We
really need a game-breaker after losing Rocket."; 5. Will Russell White and
Glyn Milburn restore glamour to Bay Area college football?;   The Bay heyday
of the late 1970s and early '80s produced a string of glamour boys -- Steve
Dils in '78, Turk Schonert in '79, Darrin Nelson in '81 and John Elway in '82.
Cal even contributed a Chuck Muncie, who finished second in the Heisman voting
in '75.;   Milburn and White, then, will need help to restore the Bay Area to
prominence. They'll need to do well this season and be followed by guys just
like them in each of the next three or four seasons.; 6. Will Washington waltz
through the Pac-10?;   Let's put it this way -- the Huskies would be the first
Pac-10 team outside of Trojanville to do so. USC is the only Pac-10 team to go
undefeated in league play since UCLA in 1965.;   There are several other
would-be tacklers standing between the Huskies and the conference title,
beginning with a season opener at Stanford, the departure of running back Greg
Lewis and the loss of quarterback Mark Brunell to a knee injury in spring
practice.;   It remains to be seen if their heirs, sophomore QB Billy Joe
Hobert and running back Beno Bryant, are more than candidates for the All-Name
Team.; 7. Does the University of Miami have another great quarterback?;  
Good, maybe not great. The recent tradition began with Jim Kelly in 1979, who
was followed without interruption by four more outstanding QBs: Bernie Kosar
(national title for 1983 season), Vinny Testaverde (Heisman Trophy, 1986),
Steve Walsh (national title for 1987 season) and Craig Erickson (national
title for 1989 season). The star of the moment is Gino Torretta of Pinole, a
junior who has subbed very effectively for Erickson and already owns the
school's single-game record for passing yardage (468 against San Jose State in
1989).; 8. Can Michigan beat Notre Dame and keep alive its hopes for a title?;
  The two goals are not mutually exclusive. The Wolverines lost to Notre Dame
in their season opener last year and four weeks later still wound up No. 1,
with one-point losses to Michigan State and Iowa toppling them again.;   But
Michigan starts the season six feet under. That's how far the field in
Michigan Stadium was lowered to install a new synthetic turf.;   The
Wolverines have three first-time starters among their four defensive backs and
their schedule is brutal, with Notre Dame visiting Sept. 14 and FSU on Sept.
28.; 9. Will Colorado repeat, and can they do it fair and square?;   The Buffs
are still touchy about the fifth down that let them beat Missouri. The fact
is, the Colorado offense may need an extra down every game this season, having
lost eight starters, including running back Eric Bieniemy.;   The Buffs' hopes
ride on quarterback Darian Hagan's left knee, which he injured in last
season's 10-9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl.;   10. How about the new
system to crown a national champion?;   What new system? Jim Brock, executive
vice president of the Cotton Bowl, said there's only a 10 percent chance that
the Cotton-Fiesta-Orange-Sugar coalition will have a system worked out for
this season.;   "We've agreed to agree and that's about it," he said.;   The
tentative plan works this way: If the conference champion aligned with one of
those four bowls is ranked No. 1 or 2 in the nation, the next highest-ranked
team available will be matched against it.;   What if Oklahoma is champion of
the Big Eight, which is aligned with the Orange Bowl, and ranked No. 1, and
Houston is the Cotton Bowl-bound SWC champion and ranked No. 2? Or what if one
of the Pac-10 schools is No. 1 or 2 -- what happens with the Rose Bowl?;  
There are more questions than answers right now -- but then that's the case
with college football at this time every year.  </TEXT>
