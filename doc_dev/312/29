<LEADPARA>  Games of the Century come around every three or four years, but the Florida
State-Miami game today figures to be one of the better ones.;   Their match
marks the 26th time No. 1 will play No. 2, but few of the 25 others came this
late in the season or, consequently, were as likely to decide the national
champion.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IT'S GAME OF THE YEAR, IF NOT CENTURY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     If the top-ranked Seminoles win the 9 a.m. game in Tallahassee, Fla.,
they'll still have two more huge games to play -- on Nov. 30, against
fifth-ranked Florida, and the Orange Bowl, probably against Nebraska. If the
Hurricanes win, they'll play Boston College and San Diego State before heading
to the Orange Bowl. If Florida State loses, it's going to the Cotton Bowl. If
Miami loses, it'll play in the Blockbuster Bowl.;   But the latest Game of the
Century isn't the only game of the day. A look at the schedule:;   (check) No.
2 Miami (8-0) at No. 1 Florida State (10-0). TV: CH7CH11CH13, 9 a.m.;  
(check) No. 12 Notre Dame (8-2) at No. 8 Penn State (8-2): It's a good game,
though little is on the line. The Irish are Sugar Bowl-bound, win or lose, and
the Nittany Lions will play in the Fiesta Bowl.;   (check) No. 4 Michigan
(8-1) at No. 25 Illinois (6-3): The Rose Bowl becomes the national title game
if Florida State wins today but loses to Florida. But first, the Wolverines
have to get by the Illini today. And, technically, third-rated Washington
(9-0) must beat Oregon State (0-9). The superstitious Huskies, 43 1/2-point
favorites, are asking Rose Bowl representatives to stay home today. Last
season, with Rose Bowl reps around, an upset loss to UCLA spoiled their chance
to go undefeated and win a national title.;   (check) Arizona State (5-4) at
No. 6 Cal (8-1): With a Citrus Bowl bid nearly in hand for Cal, Russell White
tries to become the first Bears player to rush for 1,000 yards twice in his
career. Radio: KGO (810), 1 p.m.;   (check) No. 22 Stanford (6-3) at
Washington State (4-5): The Cardinal must win today to be assured an
invitation to the Aloha Bowl. Otherwise, it'll have to win the Big Game, which
traditionally knocks teams out of bowl contention. Radio: KCBS (740), 1 p.m.; 
 (check) No. 23 Brigham Young (7-3) at San Diego State (8-2): The Western
Athletic Conference title is decided today. Winner goes to the Holiday Bowl,
loser to the Freedom Bowl. TV: ESPN, 7:30 p.m.  </TEXT>
