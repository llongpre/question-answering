<LEADPARA>  Although nothing will be signed or sealed until today -- the new date when
bowl bids can formally be extended -- Saturday's games took care of delivering
some teams to their postseason games.;   Miami's 17-16 victory over top-ranked
Florida State sent the Hurricanes into the Orange Bowl for a Jan. 1 date with
the Big Eight Conference champion.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     No. 11 Nebraska apparently needs only to beat Oklahoma on Nov. 29 to earn
the other Orange Bowl berth. The Cornhuskers and No. 16 Colorado are tied for
the conference lead, but Orange Bowl officials said they would take the higher
ranked team.;   "If we beat Oklahoma, we have Miami in Miami," Nebraska Coach
Tom Osborne said after his team's 38-13 victory over Iowa State. "It would be
a little better to have Florida State in Miami, but you take what's handed to
you.";   Osborne said it was his understanding that there is a deal in the
works to send the Big Eight runner-up to the Blockbuster Bowl and third-place
team to the Gator Bowl.;   If Nebraska beats Oklahoma and Colorado wins its
season finale against Iowa State, the 16th-ranked Buffaloes would face No. 7
Alabama in the Blockbuster Bowl. Oklahoma then would head for the Gator Bowl
against Virginia.;   The consolation prize for Florida State is a trip to the
Cotton Bowl to play the Southwest Conference champion on New Year's Day. Texas
A&amp;M needs one victory in its final two games to clinch the host spot.;  
Nothing happened Saturday to disturb the Rose Bowl pairing of No. 3 Washington
and No. 4 Michigan, who clinched the Big Ten Conference title.;   Four other
Big Ten schools also are expected to receive bowl invitations.;   No. 9 Iowa
clinched second place in the Big Ten and earned a ticket to the Holiday Bowl
against the Western Athletic Conference champion. Despite Saturday's 20-0 loss
to Michigan, No. 25 Illinois is expected to go to the Sun Bowl against UCLA.; 
 No. 18 Ohio State, which faces Michigan next weekend, will play No. 17
Syracuse in the Hall of Fame Bowl, and Indiana is expected to face Baylor in
the Copper Bowl.  </TEXT>
