Rating the five best New Year's Day bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
1. Orange Bowl. Colorado can clinch the national championship, and should, 
against a Notre Dame team that usually stinks out the joint in Miami. The Irish 
will be in big trouble against the quicker Buffaloes if Rocket Ismail is slowed 
by a shoulder injury. . . . 2. Rose Bowl. Bo Schembechler's retirement makes 
this special. The Wolverines used to lose in Pasadena because they couldn't 
pass. Now they are well-balanced (2,380 yards running, 1,818 passing). But the 
key is the young USC quarterback, Todd Marinovich, who must regain his form 
after an off day against UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
3. Fiesta Bowl. Florida State is playing better than anyone in the nation after 
losing its first two games. Coming off a rare win over Oklahoma, Nebraska will 
keep it close, high-scoring and entertaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
4. Sugar Bowl. Kickoff will be about a half-hour after the Orange Bowl starts, 
and by the fourth quarter, Miami could be shooting for a national title. An 
upset might silence Bill Curry's critics at Alabama -- at least for a month or 
two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
5. Cotton Bowl. In Arkansas and Tennessee they care very much about this 
neighborhood brawl, but it will draw a yawn from the rest of the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The best musical show will be in Pasadena, where the always powerful Michigan 
band is matched against colorful USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trojan wide receiver John Jackson has completed the grand slam of athletic and 
academic honors. A 3.30 GPA graduate in business who is working on his master's 
degree, Jackson has won an NCAA postgraduate scholarship, been named to the 
NCAA Top Six and been selected as a National Football Foundation 
scholar-athlete, Woody Hayes scholar-athlete and first-team GTE academic 
All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rising star at NBC, Joel Meyers, will announce the Freedom Bowl on TV 
Saturday and the Rose Bowl on radio Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Florida running back Emmitt Smith will be the center of attention in the 
Freedom, but Washington center Bern Brostek is projected to be a first-round 
draft choice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AFC and NFC wild-card games each would receive more attention if they were 
played on different days, but TV ratings are better on Sunday than on Saturday. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
By now, we've gotten used to playoffs without the Raiders, Dolphins and 
Cowboys. But no Bears, either? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a couple of sleepers to make it to the Super Bowl, try 
the Rams and Browns. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four offensive teams in the AFC didn't get into the playoffs 
-- and neither did three of the top five defensive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda says the first time he met Billy Martin was on the diamond. But the 
sport was boxing. "I was pitching for Kansas City against the Yankees in 1956," 
the Dodger manager recalled. "I threw at him. A fight broke out. It wasn't long 
after, though, that we became friends. You just had to be in the same room with 
the guy for an hour to love him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda on Martin, the manager: "He knew how to motivate people. That made him 
a winner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his numbers, Brett Hull isn't half the hockey player his father 
Bobby was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The change in the style of play in the NHL is reflected in the statistics of 
Doug Harvey, the Hall of Fame defenseman who died Tuesday at 65. The most goals 
he scored in a single season was nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Robb Stauber, the goaltender out of the University of Minnesota who made Mark 
Fitzpatrick expendable, still hasn't played for the Kings' New Haven farm club 
because of groin and back injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jerry Burns and Burgess Meredith. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The more thoroughbred racing there is, the less predictable it gets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure it is to hear Trevor Denman call the races at Santa Anita 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Their last 0.2-second defeat to the Celtics was just another step in the 
learning process for the young Clippers. What they learned is that it helps to 
be part of the NBA Establishment when crucial calls are made by officials. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Who else but Larry Bird and Magic Johnson did you expect to decide the outcomes 
of two games in the same city the same night with free throws? . . . 
</P>
<P>
NFL take note: The Clipper-Celtic game was long by NBA standards. It lasted 2 
hours 15 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to rap the Boston hierarchy for not keeping up with the Lakers, but 
this would be a much different club if not for the Len Bias tragedy and the 
defection of Brian Shaw to Italy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No team with Akeem Olajuwon in the lineup should have a losing record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michigan will be the sentimental favorite on the moon Monday. Three Apollo 15 
crew members who are graduates of the university left a UM flag there.
