Colorado and Tennessee will meet in the inaugural Disneyland Pigskin Classic on 
Aug. 26 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sources from both schools and the Orange County Sports Assn. confirmed the 
matchup, which will be announced at a press conference at 10:30 a.m. today at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches from both schools are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Each team is guaranteed $550,000 and 25% of the profits after expenses. 
Although a television contract has not been signed, Orange County Sports Assn. 
officials have been negotiating with Raycom. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee and Colorado were chosen from a list of six teams from last year's 
Associated Press final top 10 rankings; Florida State, Michigan, Alabama and 
Illinois also were on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado (11-1) was ranked No. 4 in the nation and Tennessee (11-1) was fifth. 
Colorado lost to Notre Dame, 21-6, in the Orange Bowl. Tennessee beat Arkansas, 
31-27, in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado and Tennessee will meet for the first time, but the Buffaloes are no 
strangers to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes are 0-2 in Freedom Bowls, losing to Washington, 20-17, in 1985 
and to Brigham Young, 20-17, in 1988. Colorado will be playing a Southeastern 
Conference school for the first time since 1980, when the Buffaloes lost, 
23-20, at Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee game will be the first of five tough nonconference games in a 
schedule that also includes against Texas, Illinois, Washington and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes feature several players from the Los Angeles area, including 
quarterback Darian Hagan (Locke High School) and halfback Eric Bieniemy (Bishop 
Amat). They also signed Los Alamitos running back Erik Mitchell to a letter of 
intent last week.
