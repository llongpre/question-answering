<LEADPARA>  Newly confident 11th-ranked Nebraska wants to thank Colorado quarterback
Darian Hagan for inspiring its 19-14 win Friday over No. 19 Oklahoma.;   "We
had a message on the board," Cornhuskers quarterback Keithen McCant said of a
bulletin board in the team locker room.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It was a quote from Hagan. He said Oklahoma would win because they have
more team speed, and he told (sophomore tight end Johnny) Mitchell to shut
up.;   "The message I have for Darian is it's his turn to shut up. We're going
to the Orange (Bowl). They're going to the where? Oh, yes, Blockbuster.";  
Nebraska's victory sends the Cornhuskers (9-1-1 overall, 6-0-1 in the Big
Eight) to the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1 against No. 1 Miami.;   Big Eight
co-champion Colorado (8-2-1, 6-0-1) goes to the Blockbuster Bowl on Dec. 28 to
meet No. 8 Alabama. Nebraska's higher national ranking gave the Cornhuskers
the Orange Bowl berth.;   Third-place Oklahoma (8-3, 5-2) plays No. 20
Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 29 in Jacksonville, Fla.;   McCant and
Mitchell said Hagan gave the Huskers added incentive to beat Oklahoma.;   "It
bothers me that we have to share the championship with Colorado -- the
luckiest team in America," Mitchell said. "Colorado still gets to play a bowl
game in Miami, just three days early.;   "But I'm happy with the outcome. The
state of Nebraska deserves it.";   It was a comment from Mitchell that helped
inspire Colorado to its 19-19 tie with Nebraska early in November.;   Mitchell
said Nebraska had given the Buffaloes too much credit and Colorado deserved no
more credit than the Cornhuskers give Kansas or Kansas State. Colorado players
said that helped get them ready for the Huskers.;   Mitchell was careful with
his words before the Oklahoma game.;   But he did some talking on the field.
He set a school tight end record with 137 yards, on a record-tying seven
receptions. His 31 receptions for the season also are a school tight end
record.  </TEXT>
