Five more reasons (other than quarterback Ty Detmer) why Brigham Young beat 
former No. 1-ranked Miami: 
</P>
<P>
(1) Defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar defense is usually as thin as the mountain air in Provo, Utah. But 
last Saturday against Miami, BYU didn't allow a touchdown pass, caused two 
turnovers, intercepted a pass, recorded three sacks and stopped the Hurricanes 
on two crucial second-half, fourth-down plays. In past seasons, short 
fourth-down attempts were gimmes for BYU opponents. So sure was the outcome 
that the Cougar offense, including Detmer, wouldn't bother budging from the 
bench on fourth-down stands. No more. "Last year I wouldn't even have gotten 
excited about it," he said. "But this year our defense is really playing well. 
They shut (Miami) down and gave us good field position all day." 
</P>
<P>
(2) Earl Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' triple threat punted four times and averaged 53.8 yards per kick. 
Of his six kickoffs, five sailed out of the end zone and the other one wasn't 
returned. He also had field goals of 32 and 29 yards, as well as two extra 
points. 
</P>
<P>
(3) The Big Mouth Factor. 
</P>
<P>
After several Hurricane players participated in some mid-week verbal bashing of 
BYU, Miami Coach Dennis Erickson ordered all lips zipped. Too late. The Cougars 
used the comments for added inspiration. Truth be known, Erickson was scared 
stiff of BYU's potential. On the eve of the game, which was Miami's season 
opener, he told Miami Herald columnist Edwin Pope that the Cougars were the 
most underrated team in the country. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
(4) Miami defensive tackle Russell Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, Miami's best defensive player, was neutralized most of the evening by 
Detmer's scrambling and BYU's massive offensive line. In fact, said Maryland, 
BYU rarely double-teamed him the entire game, a surprising tactic, considering 
Maryland's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
(5) The Altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Provo's elevation, nearly a mile high, seemed to wear down the Hurricanes. 
"Defensively, they weren't coming real hard," BYU running back Mike Salido 
said. "I saw them bent over or with their hands on their hips. They didn't 
really come to play, not after they saw a bunch of balls flying around. I even 
think we could have run on them all night." 
</P>
<P>
Since we're on this list kick, three auxiliary reasons why BYU might somehow 
sneak away with another national championship: 
</P>
<P>
(1) The publicity generated from Detmer's Heisman run will keep BYU planted 
firmly in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
(2) Of the Cougars' 10 remaining regular-season games, only Oregon, Colorado 
State, Wyoming and Hawaii offer legitimate concern. 
</P>
<P>
(3) If the defense is for real, BYU could beat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
And in case you're wondering, a perfect record means BYU must play in the 
Holiday Bowl, which provides an automatic bid to the winner of the Western 
Athletic Conference. The contract is ironclad. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl projects a payout of $1.2 million per team, which is 
considerably less than checks written by the Orange Bowl ($4.1 million per 
team), Sugar Bowl ($3.2 million), Cotton Bowl ($2.9 million) or Fiesta Bowl 
($2.25 million) in 1989. If BYU is able to finish its schedule without a loss 
and climb atop the polls, it will be interesting to see potential opponents 
choose between a chance at No. 1 or a bigger bowl payday. In 1984, Holiday Bowl 
officials expected teams to stand in line for the chance to play undefeated 
BYU. They were disappointed and eventually had to settle for Michigan, which 
was 6-5 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to do a little pie-in-the-sky guessing," said John Reid, executive 
director of the Holiday Bowl. "But this is very similar to what happened in 
'84. There's a long season to play, obviously. But we might change our sights a 
little bit. It's just that you can't set your sights too high. You have to 
temper it." 
</P>

Virginia's convincing 20-7 victory over Clemson did more than end a 29-game 
losing streak to the Tigers. Barring a collapse by Virginia, it all but ensures 
the Cavaliers an Atlantic Coast Conference championship, their second in as 
many years. This isn't the strongest of conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also makes Virginia Coach George Welsh the hottest commodity in 
college football. In eight seasons, he has become the school's winningest 
coach, which tells you all you need to know about past Virginia teams. Look for 
Welsh's name to start appearing on the wish lists of athletic directors and 
maybe some NFL general managers. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly enough, Virginia's strongest competition for the ACC title might 
come from Maryland, which is 2-0 after upsetting 25th-ranked West Virginia in 
Morgantown. The Terrapins won only three games in 1989. Virginia and Maryland 
meet in the final regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
There are better jobs to have than the ones held by Alabama Coach Gene 
Stallings and Clemson's Ken Hatfield. Stallings, who replaced Bill Curry during 
the off-season, watched the Crimson Tide begin its season with a 27-24 loss to 
Southern Mississippi, the same team that defeated Florida State in its 1989 
opener. Adding to Stallings' misery was the loss of star running back Siran 
Stacy, who injured his knee during the game and is out for the season. Alabama 
followers, not known as the most patient fans in college football, are 
reportedly in mourning. They don't take losses well. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield followed the immensely popular Danny Ford, who was eased out after 
rules improprieties were uncovered in the football program. The deeply 
religious Hatfield asked his players to refrain from drinking beer or other 
alcoholic beverages until season's end. He also doesn't allow swearing on the 
field. After the loss to Virginia, it's safe to assume that both of those rules 
were probably broken. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Clemson faces surprising Maryland at College Park, and Alabama plays 
very talented Florida. Losses could make things very sticky for Hatfield and 
Stallings. 
</P>
<P>
A strange weekend for Southern Methodist. First, the Mustangs beat Vanderbilt, 
44-7, the largest margin of victory ever recorded for a Southwest Conference 
school over a Southeastern Conference team. It was SMU's first victory over a 
Division I-A opponent since 1986. The Mustangs didn't punt during last week's 
game. They gained 233 yards rushing, a total that took them six games to reach 
in 1989. And SMU quarterback Mike Romo, a sophomore, threw six touchdown 
passes. In 12 games, Romo has set eight school records, tied one and surpassed 
Don Meredith as SMU's No. 5 career passing leader. 
</P>
<P>
Then came news on Sunday that Atlanta Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville was sending 
a game ball to the Mustangs. The Falcons defeated the Houston Oilers, the same 
team that fired Glanville and hired former University of Houston coach Jack 
Pardee as a replacement. Pardee's team had humiliated an undermanned SMU squad 
last year, 95-21. This was Glanville's pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
Said SMU Coach Forrest Gregg of the gesture: "It's Jerry's game ball and he can 
do what he wants with it. On behalf of the entire SMU team, I accept his 
gracious gift." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg may get another gift this Saturday. The Mustangs play a so-so Tulane 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Athletic Conference shouldn't be confused with the SEC just yet, 
but WAC teams won five of nine games last week: BYU over Miami, Utah over 
Minnesota at Minneapolis, Wyoming over Washington State at Pullman, Air Force 
over Hawaii and Colorado State big over Montana State. . . . The SEC has lost 
its top two running backs: Tennessee's Chuck Webb and Alabama's Stacy. . . . As 
promised by Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, Mike Pritchard, who rushed for 217 
yards against Tennessee in the Pigskin Classic, was back at wide receiver 
against Stanford. Back at halfback was Eric Bieniemy, who missed the Tennessee 
game for disciplinary reasons. Bieniemy had 149 yards against Stanford, 121 in 
the second half. He also scored the game-winning touchdown with 12 seconds 
remaining. . . . Texas owes its 17-13 upset of Penn State to walk-on kicker 
Michael Pollak, who made three field goals. Pollak, a junior, earned a 
scholarship last spring but had not attempted a field goal for Texas until last 
Saturday. In two seasons, he had three kickoffs to his credit.
