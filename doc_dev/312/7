<TEXT>  Television/radio: CH3 CH4 CH8/KNBR (680).; Records: Colorado is 10-1-1. Notre
Dame is 9-2.; Rankings: Colorado is No. 1; Notre Dame No. 5.; Colorado report:
A win today would give the Buffaloes the national title. Last season, a 21-6
loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl spoiled Colorado's bid for a national
title. This season, the Buffaloes say they aren't awed by the Irish mystique.
"I think maybe we were satisfied just getting here last year, and we let it
slip through our fingers," All-America G Joe Garten said. . . . WR Mike
Pritchard is expected to play despite a broken left hand. All-America LB
Alfred Williams has been slowed by bronchitis.; Notre Dame report: The Irish
have an outside shot at the national title but will need help. If Notre Dame
beats Colorado, No. 2 Georgia Tech loses to Nebraska and No. 3 Texas falls to
No. 4 Miami, it probably would come down to another close vote between the
Irish and the Hurricanes. NT Chris Zorich, this season's Lombardi Award
winner, might see limited action after suffering a dislocated kneecap late in
the season.; Players to watch: Colorado -- RB Eric Bieniemy (1,628 yards
rushing, 5.7 average); QB Darian Hagan (1,538 yards passing, 442 rushing).
Notre Dame -- All-purpose back Raghib "Rocket" Ismail (1,723 total yards); QB
Rick Mirer (1,824 yards passing).  </TEXT>
