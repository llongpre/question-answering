<LEADPARA>  MIAMI is in the Big East, and Notre Dame is on NBC. Florida State is in limbo,
and a better bowl system is on the way.;   Welcome to the brave new world of
college football, where new conferences, new TV deals and new alliances are
shaking up a sport that has long prided itself on tradition and stability.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Big East, which rose to prominence as a basketball league, makes its
debut as a football conference with such marquee members as Miami, Pittsburgh
and West Virginia. Although everyone won't play a full league schedule until
1993, the team with the highest national ranking at the end of the season will
be crowned conference champion.;   "You give us five years and I think we will
have the same impact as the SEC, the Pac-10 and the Big Ten," West Virginia
coach Don Nehlen said.;   Arkansas' swan song in SWC; While the Big East
begins, Arkansas bids farewell to the Southwest Conference and Florida State
and South Carolina play their final season as independents. Arkansas and South
Carolina will join the Southeastern Conference in 1992, and Florida State will
become a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.;   The SEC and ACC are part
of a groundbreaking alliance designed to improve bowl matchups and increase
the chances of a clear-cut national championship game, beginning with the 1992
season. The coalition includes four major bowls (Orange, Cotton, Sugar and
Fiesta), five conferences (SEC, SWC, Big Eight, ACC and Big East) and Notre
Dame, the only team with its own national television contract.;   Starting
this season, NBC will televise all Notre Dame home games for the next five
years. The Fighting Irish angered other members of the College Football
Association when they broke away and negotiated their own $30 million deal
with NBC, thus reducing the value of the association's contracts with ESPN and
ABC by about $50 million.;   ABC is dominant network; By adding the CFA to its
Big Ten/Pac-10 deal, ABC has become the dominant network for college football.
So dominant that the Federal Trade Commission considers it a virtual monopoly
that limits the number of games available on national television.;   An
administrative judge dismissed the FTC's antitrust suit against ABC and the
CFA this month, but the agency is appealing the decision. A ruling is expected
by early November.;   Not all changes in college football are occurring off
the field.;   In an effort to reduce the number of chip-shot field goals, the
distance between the goal posts has been narrowed by 20 percent -- from 23
feet, 4 inches to the NFL width of 18-6. It will actually be harder to make
field goals in college now because the hash marks are wider than in the pros,
meaning kickers will be forced to kick from sharper angles.;   "Sometimes,
with the old uprights, you could kick it bad and it would still squeak
through. I don't think that's going to happen anymore," South Carolina's Marty
Simpson said. "But if you kick the ball good, it shouldn't make any
difference.";   While kickers adjust to new goal posts, 16 Division I-A teams
must adjust to new coaches. The most noteworthy name is Jackie Sherrill, who
was lured out of coaching exile by Mississippi State.;   Sherrill was a big
winner at Pittsburgh and Texas A&amp;M before leaving the Aggies under a cloud of
controversy after the 1988 season. Now he will try to turn around a sagging
program in Starkville, where the Bulldogs have had only one winning season
since 1981.;   "We've got all the ingredients for success," Sherrill said.
"Mississippi State is a sleeping giant.";   Giants such as Florida State,
Michigan, Penn State, Miami and Notre Dame are almost always awake. Once
again, they're among the leading contenders for the national title, along with
Florida, Washington, Georgia Tech, Houston, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.;  
Penn State and Georgia Tech meet in the season-opening Kickoff Classic on
Wednesday at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. The following night,
Florida State plays BYU in the Pigskin Classic in Anaheim.;   Florida State
has finished in the top four the past four seasons, but never No. 1. A lot of
people expect that to change this season because the Seminoles have almost
everyone back from last year's 10-2 team plus a great group of freshmen.  </TEXT>
