<LEADPARA>  The pleasant-looking fellow at left hung up on a telephone news conference
Wednesday. Buddy Ryan got testy when Washington-area reporters asked if the
Philadelphia Eagles' failure to win a playoff game in his tenure as head coach
puts more pressure on him to beat the Redskins this weekend.;    "No, it sure
doesn't," he said. "Most people haven't been in the playoffs. When was the
last time y'all were in the playoffs?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Someone noted that the Redskins are hardly winless in the postseason since
Ryan took over in Philadelphia.;    "Yeah, they won a Super Bowl in 1987. What
happened to them in '88 and '89? You guys are full of bull. Gotta go. Bye,"
Ryan said. Click!;  MANY REMAIN LOST IN COLORADO'S WAKE; No. 2 Georgia Tech
couldn't have been any unhappier over No. 1 Colorado's 10-9 victory in the
Orange Bowl than were Las Vegas bookies.;    Notre Dame was an early one- to
two-point favorite in the game, but bettors favoring Colorado wagered enough
money to make their team a one-point favorite. Bookmakers had to pay off both
ways on some bets, and the bookies were left holding the bag.;    Also still
holding the bag is J.C. Lauderback, the officiating crew chief responsible for
Colorado's last-second fifth-down victory at Missouri. Lauderback, a high
school math teacher, remains contrite.;    "You would think," he said, "that a
guy who teaches calculus for a living could count to five.";  'I saw the film.
. . . There's no question it was a clip.  '-- Colorado Coach Bill McCartney,
on the penalty against Notre Dame's Greg Davis that negated a 91-yard punt
return in the Orange Bowl;  'Greg's head was in front of the guy, but his
shoulders were behind. Maybe technically, it was a clip.  '-- Notre Dame Coach
