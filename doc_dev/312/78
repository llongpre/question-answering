MORNING BRIEFING: HOLTZ CAN'T RESIST ()1 FINAL JAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the ballots were counted in the Associated Press college football poll and 
Notre Dame officially was named the No. 1 team in the nation, Coach Lou Holtz 
couldn't resist getting in a final jab at Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (12-0) defeated Miami, 31-30, in October, but Johnson has been 
saying to anyone who will listen that the Hurricanes (11-1) should have been 
No. 1 because they could have tied Notre Dame by kicking an extra point with 45 
seconds left. Johnson says Miami gave the game and the national title to Notre 
Dame by trying a 2-point conversion pass that would have won the game had it 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Jimmy Johnson for a long time," Holtz said. "I've never known Jimmy 
Johnson to give away anything except the check. We would have come back and won 
it. They'd have had to kick off. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have kicked it (the extra point). That was his decision, that wasn't 
ours. He didn't come over and consult me. I didn't send him a note. It was his 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Add No. 1: Holtz pointed out that the situation this season is similar to last 
season's when No. 1 Miami defeated No. 2 Florida State, 26-25, after the 
Seminoles scored in the final minute but missed on a 2-point conversion 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've made it abundantly clear on a consistent basis that I have great 
respect for Miami and their football team," Holtz said. "But what's the 
difference between this year and last year with Florida State? 
</P>
<P>
"If (Johnson) did give it to us, I want to say on behalf of the entire Notre 
Dame football team, 'We thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Holtz: Before beating West Virginia, 34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl to nail down 
the No. 1 spot, Holtz was asked if he knew how to handle his first top-ranking 
in 19 years as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no Barry Switzer," Holtz said. "This sucker's new to me." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, when told that the Irish probably will be ranked No. 1 again at the 
start of next season, Holtz showed he does, indeed, know how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my," he said. "We've really got some problems on our team." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Holtz: During a speech last June in St. Louis, at the Associated Press 
Sports Editors national convention, he said: "I can assure you all of one 
thing. Notre Dame will win the national championship. Just when and who will be 
coaching then, I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: UCLA, by finishing No. 6 in the final AP poll, has 5 
finishes in the top 10 in the past 7 seasons. Only Nebraska, with 6, has more, 
and Miami also has 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins also have won 46 games in the past 5 seasons, tied with Auburn 
behind only Miami (52), Oklahoma (51), Nebraska (50) and Brigham Young (49). 
</P>
<P>
USC has only 2 top 10 finishes the past 7 seasons and has won 40 games in the 
5-year span. Not only that, UCLA has finished in the top 20 in each of the past 
7 seasons, while the Trojans have been unranked 3 times. USC has not finished 
higher than UCLA in any of those 7 seasons.
