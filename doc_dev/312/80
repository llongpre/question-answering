<LEADPARA>  Miami remains the nation's No. 1-ranked team and Cal is still the
highest-ranked team in the Bay Area, but the gap between them and their
pursuers narrowed over the weekend.;   Cal's 38-21 loss to Stanford on
Saturday dropped the Bears from sixth to 14th in the Associated Press poll
released Sunday. Conversely, the victory pushed Stanford from 21st to 17th.
The change doesn't alter the teams' bowl destinies -- Stanford will play
Georgia Tech in the Dec. 25 Aloha Bowl, and Cal will face Clemson in the Jan.
1 Citrus Bowl.  </LEADPARA>

HUSKIES CLOSE IN ON NO. 1 MIAMI  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Miami improved to 10-0 with a surprisingly close 19-14 victory over Boston
College. Second-ranked Washington's 56-21 win over Washington State for the
coveted Apple Cup (a state rivalry thing) was apparently more impressive to
the nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who do the voting.;  
The Huskies (11-0) cut Miami's lead in overall poll points from 40 to 20 and
picked up an additional 8 1/2 first-place votes. Miami received 37 1/2
first-place votes and a total of 1,476 1/2 points. Washington collected 22 1/2
first-place votes and 1,456 1/2 points.;   Miami running back Martin Patton
took offense at the slide, attributing the Hurricanes' lackluster showing
against Boston College to their cataclysmic 17-16 win over Florida State the
previous week.;   "You have to remember that we just came off one of the
biggest games of the year, and we don't have any sisters of the poor and all
that on our schedule," he said.;   Miami will face No. 11 Nebraska or No. 15
Colorado in the Orange Bowl. Another unimpressive victory by the Hurricanes in
their season finale against San Diego State could further jeopardize their
reign.;   It doesn't help that Miami will finish the season without Stephen
McGuire, its leading rusher. McGuire injured his left knee against Boston
College, and surgery to repair torn ligaments is scheduled today. McGuire was
replaced Saturday by Patton, who had been reinstated after an incident with
the police resulted in a one-game suspension.;   "The polls will all be
decided on New Year's Day," said cornerback Dana Hall of Washington, which
plays Big Ten champion and fourth-ranked Michigan in the Rose Bowl. "We still
have one goal we haven't made, and that's the national title. But I won't be
frustrated if we finish 12-0 and don't finish No. 1, because I know some guys
who never sweated it out on the field are doing the voting.";   For whatever
reason, the odds will be with Miami if it finishes the season undefeated.
Since AP started its permanent postseason poll in 1968, no top-ranked team has
failed to win the national championship after winning a bowl game.; ETC.: Cal
tackle Troy Auzenne, a 6-foot-7, 285-pound senior, was named to a 24-player
All-America team selected by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA)
. . . Air Force (9-3, 6-2) came back to defeat Hawaii 24-20 in Honolulu on
Saturday night in the Western Athletic Conference finale for both teams. The
Falcons play Mississippi State in the Dec. 29 Liberty Bowl. The Rainbows
(4-6-1, 3-5) close their season Saturday, hosting Notre Dame.  </TEXT>
