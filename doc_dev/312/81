<LEADPARA>  BEING the only unbeaten team in the country should be enough to make you No.

<TEXT>     Georgia Tech didn't deserve a share of the national championship. The
Yellow Jackets, with their 11-0-1 record, didn't deserve the coaches' vote.
Not as much as Colorado did. Colorado was robbed.;    The Buffaloes (11-1-1)
went into New Year's Day as the No. 1 team in both polls. How they came out as
No. 2 in the United Press International coaches' poll Wednesday is not only a
shock and a mystery, it's a violation of sports law. To lose, a champion must
be KO'd. That's the law.;    Colorado, the champion going into play Tuesday,
wasn't KO'd. It didn't even lose. Colorado won, for heaven's sake. It won
after losing its starting quarterback! Colorado beat Notre Dame with its
starting quarterback, Darian Hagan, on the sideline for the second half
because of a knee injury.;    And, then, Colorado slipped to No. 2 in the
coaches' poll.;    You must be joking.;    Did Colorado lose style points? The
Buffaloes needed a clipping penalty to beat Notre Dame. They needed a fifth
down to beat Missouri. They needed everything they got to beat Stanford.;   
BUT Colorado didn't ask for these gifts, and it shouldn't have been expected
to return them. Nor should it be penalized for receiving them. Breaks of the
game. Yes, Colorado got some mighty big breaks this season. But, really now,
if the sideline marker at Missouri had read fourth down -- rather than third
-- don't you think Colorado would have run the ball in from the 1-foot line,
instead of spiking it to stop the clock?;    The question Wednesday, however
-- the only question to be considered -- was this: Which college football team
had the best season?;    Colorado, after struggling early, won its last 10
games.;    And Georgia Tech never lost.;    Of course, Georgia Tech never
played Washington, the Pacific 10 Conference champion. Or Tennessee, the
Southeastern Conference champion. Or Texas, the Southwest Conference champion.
Georgia Tech didn't play at Texas, at Illinois, at Nebraska. Colorado forged
its 11-1-1 record while playing six bowl teams, and it would have been seven
had Oklahoma not been on probation.;    Georgia Tech played five bowl teams,
but two of the five were Maryland (6-5-1) and North Carolina State (7-5).
Clemson and Virginia were two more.;    Then there was Nebraska, Tech's Citrus
Bowl foil. Nebraska was the only common opponent for Georgia Tech and
Colorado, and evidently some people bought Bobby Ross' comparative-score
argument.;    AFTER the 45-21 rout Tuesday, Ross, the Georgia Tech coach,
reminded everybody that Colorado had beaten Nebraska by nine fewer points,
27-12. It went unmentioned that Colorado beat Nebraska at Nebraska, when
Nebraska was 9-0. Before Nebraska lost its starting quarterback to a
season-ending injury, before Nebraska had the life knocked out of it in a
45-10 loss to hated Oklahoma.;    Nebraska wasn't a common opponent; Colorado
played a much better team than Tech did.;    And that was the case all season;
Tech played an inferior schedule. That's what you get when you play in the
ACC. Georgia Tech can't help that; what it can help is scheduling
non-conference opponents such as Tennessee-Chattanooga.;    Colorado scheduled
Tennessee -- without the Chattanooga -- and took a tie. Colorado scheduled a
Big Ten school, Illinois, and took a loss. Had Colorado scheduled Chattanooga
and South Carolina and Virginia Tech, the coaches couldn't have made the
mistake they made Wednesday.  </TEXT>
