Colorado and Tennessee are about to embark on what they trust will be 13-game 
seasons, and their coaches want the teams to remember this: The bowl game is 
the one at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The game they will play at Anaheim Stadium Aug. 26, the first Disneyland 
Pigskin game, only has the look of a bowl game, matching two teams that 
finished the 1989 season with 11-1 records and enter this season ranked among 
the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to treat this like a bowl game because it's just the first game 
of a long season," said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, who guided the Buffaloes 
through an emotion-charged season last year during which quarterback Sal Aunese 
died of complications from stomach cancer in September. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, dedicating its season to Aunese and making a memorial of his locker, 
went undefeated last year until a 21-6 loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl 
left them a step shy of a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Garten, Colorado's consensus All-American offensive lineman from Valencia 
High School and a contender for the Outland Trophy this season, said the team 
has been ready to reassert itself since that loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," Garten said. "We wanted to start it right then." 
</P>
<P>
They are back for another run, this time behind a coach whose job is secure for 
the rest of his career. McCartney, who turns 50 this month, signed a 15-year 
contract in July. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Colorado will make its run behind Darian Hagan, the junior whom 
Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors calls the "most exciting quarterback I have seen 
run the option in my entire coaching career." 
</P>
<P>
Hagan ran for 1,004 yards last season and passed for 1,002 in the offense that 
has come to be known as the I-bone, and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado will be without running back Eric Bieniemy, who is suspended for the 
game for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee will begin this season against a team whose name is not much 
different from last year's opening opponent, Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers struggled against a lesser opponent before winning, 17-14. They 
cannot afford to start slowly this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big game," Tennessee quarterback Andy Kelly said. "Colorado is a big 
challenge this early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's only loss last season was to Southeastern Conference rival Alabama, 
47-30, and Majors focuses his attention on the SEC race. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd swap this for a conference win," he said. "I'd swap anything for a 
conference win." 
</P>
<P>
Majors breathed a sigh of relief this summer when he learned running back Chuck 
Webb had satisfied academic eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Chuck Webb has the talent to be as fine a running back as there is in 
the country," Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb rushed for an average of 123.6 yards a game last season, despite not 
becoming a starter until the sixth game. 
</P>
<P>
Game organizers said 25,000 to 30,000 tickets have been sold for the game.
