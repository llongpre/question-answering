It's official now. Los Angeles has another quarterback controversy. The Raiders 
have lost four of their last six -- and confidence in Jay Schroeder. . . . Here 
is a team clearly in need of a lift and Steve Beuerlein might be able to supply 
it if Al Davis ever decides to bury the hatchet and dress Beuerlein in silver 
and black instead of civilian clothes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vince Evans was a quick fix against Kansas City in the fourth quarter after 
Schroeder went down, but he's 35 and until Sunday had played in just one NFL 
game since 1987. . . . 
</P>
<P>
L.A. fans showed they can be as tasteless as any when some of them cheered 
Schroeder's injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's most consistent weapon was the long snap count. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that San Francisco and the New York Giants are no longer unbeaten, their 
game next Monday night should be marked down to Super Bowl XXIV 1/4 . . . . 
</P>
<P>
When teams play with the passion the Rams showed in Candlestick Park, they can 
do remarkable things. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And so much for the notion that the Rams would be looking past the 49ers to 
Cleveland next week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What has gotten into the Indianapolis Colts and Minnesota Vikings? . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC-Notre Dame had something USC-UCLA lacked -- defense. Maybe that's why, in 
comparison, Saturday's game was boring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans threw 39 passes, but their play calling seemed too conservative. 
Not enough bombs to Gary Wellman or Johnnie Morton and no passes on first or 
second down after they reached the Notre Dame nine-yard line on the opening 
drive that ended in a field goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The score wasn't the only similarity between the 1990 and 1940 games. Neither 
team had names on the back of its jerseys and both wore black shoes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A close contest is one in which each team has 17 first downs and Notre Dame has 
one more scrimmage play than USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former President Reagan, who conducted the coin flip Saturday, said he was 
neutral and urged the Irish and Trojans to "win one for the Flipper." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nice touch before the start of the second half was Todd Marinovich stopping on 
his way to the bench to shake hands with Rocket Ismail, who was awaiting the 
kickoff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
TV replays indicated that the correct call was made when USC receiver Gary 
Wellman was stopped short of a first down late in the game, but that pass 
interference should have been called against the Trojans on Notre Dame's 
incomplete pass on fourth down from the one in the last quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive bowl games are Notre Dame-Colorado in the Orange, 
Texas-Miami in the Cotton, Penn State-Florida State in the Blockbuster and 
BYU-Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Outside Iowa City and Seattle, apathy toward the Rose Bowl is running rampant. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma might live to regret kicking that field goal in the final seconds 
against Nebraska with a 42-10 lead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I hope the Associated Press will be able to find a place in the top 10 now for 
Penn State, which has the longest winning streak in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most boring record in college football: The 136 consecutive extra points kicked 
by Miami's Carlos Huerta. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Clippers sold out the Sports Arena before the Lakers 
sold out the Forum. Well, at least, Michael Jordan sold out the Arena Friday. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure which was more surprising, the New Jersey Nets' 34-game road 
losing streak or two-game road winning streak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pictured on the cover of the Pittsburgh Pirate media guide before the 1990 
season were Jim Leyland, who became National League manager of the year; Barry 
Bonds, who became most valuable player; and Doug Drabek, who became the Cy 
Young Award winner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Latest example of the durability of the biggest little men in sports, jockeys, 
was Gary Stevens winning a race at Hollywood Park Saturday only 10 days after 
suffering a broken elbow in a spill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Sandstrom is on a goal-scoring tear, but the deal that sent Bernie 
Nicholls to the New York Rangers for Sandstrom and Tony Granato has helped the 
Kings' defense more than the offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Few coaches ever made more of a difference in hockey than Fred Shero. . . . Lou 
Holtz on his Notre Dame players: "I love 'em. They dislike me. That makes for a 
good relationship."
