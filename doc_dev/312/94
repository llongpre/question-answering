<LEADPARA>  Notre Dame would have been mighty embarrassed to take an 8-4 record to the
Sugar Bowl, but the 18th-ranked Fighting Irish were able to outlast Hawaii
48-42 Saturday.;   Tony Brooks and Jerome Bettis scored two touchdowns apiece
for Notre Dame (9-3), which led 48-28 after Bettis scored his second touchdown
on a 2-yard run with 5 minutes, 15 seconds left in the game.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Rainbows (4-7-1) scored two late touchdowns, with reserve quarterback
Ivin Jasper leading the charge by scoring on a 31-yard run with 3:42 left and,
after Hawaii recovered an onside kick, throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to
Eddie Kealoha with 1:38 to play.;   But Notre Dame (9-3) recovered Hawaii's
ensuing onside kick and ran out the clock to preserve the victory.;   The
Irish amassed 499 yards in total offense but surrendered 473 yards to the
scrappy Rainbows, who were involved in a 35-35 tie at San Jose State on Nov.
16.;   Irish quarterback Rick Mirer completed 12 of 19 passes for 218 yards
and receiver Tony Smith had a career-high nine catches for 140 yards.;  
Hawaii's starting quarterback, Michael Carter, rushed 23 times for 133 yards
and two scores, but it wasn't enough as three turnovers on Hawaii's first
three possessions led to two quick Notre Dame touchdowns.;   Notre Dame's
fourth touchdown, which provided a 28-7 lead, was its 56th of the season,
breaking the school record of 55 set in 1912.;   Clint Johnson returned a
kickoff 93 yards for a third-quarter Notre Dame touchdown that gave the Irish
a 42-20 lead with 2:15 left in the third quarter. The touchdown followed a
42-yard field goal by Hawaii's Jason Elam.;   Notre Dame had received its
Sugar Bowl bid despite three losses, two of which came against Tennessee and
Penn State in the eight days before bowl bids were announced. Penn State
(10-2) had to settle for the Fiesta Bowl despite beating the Irish.  </TEXT>
