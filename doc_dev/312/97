<LEADPARA>  Funky stereo speakers? Nope, just a couple of radial tires worthy of Formula
One driving champion Ayrton Senna's attention.;    But Senna's turntable

<TEXT>  PERHAPS HE LIKES ABSTRACT MUSIC; New Jersey Nets forward Chris Morris
encountered teammate Rick Carlisle playing the piano in a Los Angeles hotel

FLOAT LIKE BUTTERFLY, STING YELLOW JACKETS; Heavyweight boxing champion
Evander Holyfield is from Atlanta and supposedly hoped Georgia Tech would win
the national college football championship.;     So why did Holyfield give an
inspirational pregame talk to the Colorado players and stand on the Buffaloes'
sideline during their 10-9 Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame?;     Ken
Sanders, Holyfield's manager, said, "I don't think he looked at it that he was
inspiring Colorado to win the national title. He definitely wanted Tech to win
it.";     So why not give a pep talk to Notre Dame, instead? "If Evander's
like me," Sanders said, "I'm sure he thought (Irish Coach) Lou Holtz was so
egotistical that nobody can speak with him.";     Or maybe Holyfield wanted to
acclimate himself to shared titles, which he is likely to encounter if he
claims to be heavyweight champ long enough.; 'The Celtics were razor sharp.
They were awesome. They denied everything we tried. They outshot, outhustled,
outrebounded us. . . . They shellacked us. They waxed us. They drilled us. '--
