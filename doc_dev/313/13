   Ten years. Time enough for a
forest to spring from lifeless ash. Time enough for people in the
shadow of a restless volcano to recover, even profit, from
catastrophe.
   But never time enough to forget.
   Even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket of
green, the violence of May 18, 1980, remains seared in memory. That
was the day Mount St. Helens exploded, killing 57 people,
flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   Don McElwain remembers. He was camping 20 miles away when hot
ash engulfed him, turning his day to night.
   ``I'm a former Army Ranger and not much scares me,'' he said.
``But I'll tell you, I was doing some praying.''
   McElwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback,
breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode across
ash that singed the hair on the horses' legs.
   But the ordeal did not destroy his love of Mount St. Helens.
Like many of the volcano's neighbors, McElwain, 53, hopes to profit
from a disaster that changed this region's economic life as surely
as it rearranged the landscape. He's been scouting out land,
thinking of starting up a small tourist resort.
   ``Someday,'' he said, ``this place will be beautiful again.''
   Before it erupted, Mount St. Helens was a snowy, symmetrical,
seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests.
Thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness along
crystal-clear Spirit Lake, on the mountain's north side.
   The idyll couldn't last. Mount St. Helens, historically one of
the Cascade Range's most active volcanoes, had not erupted since
1857. Geologists warned it was overdue.
   At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, after weeks of sputtering and
rumbling, the volcano roared awake. An earthquake jarred loose a
huge slab that slid into the lake, weakening the mountain's north
side.
   Magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcano's vents
suddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas, rock and ash
2,500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima.
   A super-heated cloud of pulverized rock, focused horizontally by
the misshapen crater, flattened 150-foot-tall fir trees like pieces
of straw. Across Spirit Lake, a mammoth wave caused by the
landslide sloshed over the opposite ridge, washing the slopes bare
of the downed timber.
   Victims caught in the blast included U.S. Geological Survey
scientist David Johnston, killed even as he monitored delicate
measuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away. Photographer Reid
Blackburn snapped a few pictures, then retreated to his car. He was
found two days later, smothered by ash.
   Harry Truman, who had lived on the mountain 54 years, defied
orders to leave his Spirit Lake lodge, declaring, ``That mountain
is a part of Truman, and I'm a part of it.''
   His words were prophetic. Truman and his lodge were buried under
120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new, deeper Spirit Lake, a
steaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer of
uprooted trees scoured of bark.
   The volcano's heat melted glaciers and starting surging
mudflows. One wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the Toutle River,
destroying trucks, bridges and more than 200 homes.
   An ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward,
darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6
inches deep.
   To observers first returning to the mountain, the destruction
seemed complete. But as weeks went by, scientists watched in
amazement as life appeared amid the ruin.
   Pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels, poking their
heads through ash. Colonies of ants went busily about their
business. Even the most barren areas were soon invaded by
ballooning spiders and beetles, scavengers that floated in on
parachute-like webs and survived on the remains of other insects
blown their way.
   The first summer, green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rose
through 10-inch layers of ash. Later, elk and deer wandered back,
and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted in
fertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash.
   Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a
110,000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural
regeneration, the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall.
Outside the monument, the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies
gave nature a jump start, salvaging downed trees and planting
seedlings in holes bored through ash. Today, some of those trees
stand 25 feet tall.
   As nature heals, so do people. After the eruption, communities
still grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaning
up.
   Fearing more floods, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged rivers,
built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to Spirit Lake. This May
19, officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the Toutle
River, finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than $560
million.
   Muddy rivers have grown clearer, and many residents now look to
St. Helens in hope, not fear. They're staking their futures on the
flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the
contiguous United States.
   More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or
stop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano.
Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entry
restrictions were eased in 1987.
   Roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs, and the
once-flooded town of Toutle sponsors an annual Volcano Daze
Festival. Developers are preparing for 1992, when a highway will be
extended to a new visitor's center peering into the volcano's
crater.
   On sunny spring weekends, the mountain's southern flank becomes
a playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers. There are higher
Northwest mountains for climbing, more accessible mountains for
skiing. But Mount St. Helens, its former 9,677-foot summit reduced
1,300 feet by the eruption, has a magnetic appeal.
   ``I think it's a morbid curiosity,'' said Martha Miller, peering
into the barren crater from the rim after a grueling, six-hour
climb on skis.
   ``It's the mystique,'' said her husband, Ben, who skied the
volcano partly to impress friends back home in New Hampshire, where
the mountains are more sedate. ``St. Helens is an an active
volcano, and everyone's heard of it.''
   Ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time, and the volcano
still sputters. The latest steam release occurred April 25.
   Scientists don't rule out more fireworks but say the possibility
of an eruption is low. A 920-foot lava dome on the crater floor has
not grown since 1986, and geologists, who have honed their
predictive skills since 1980, are confident they can give days or
weeks notice of significant eruptions.
   That's scant reassurance at the volcano rim, where the
mountain's jagged wounds are still raw, its destructive power still
overwhelming. Silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed the
skiers as they stared into the immense crater.
   Ten years later, Mount St. Helens still commands respect.
   ``It makes you feel pretty small,'' Martha Miller said. She
turned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater, and the
skiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest, far
below.
