   The catastrophic eruption of Mount St.
Helens 10 years ago taught scientists and ordinary citizens lessons
that can save lives, geologists told a symposium near the volcano
today.
   ``It caught our attention and the world's attention, and we
learned a great deal,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano
hazards for the U.S. Geological Survey. ``It raises a lot of
awareness of volcanism.''
   Christiansen told a ``Ten Years Later'' symposium on the
anniversary of the blast that lessons from Mount St. Helens apply
to other volcanos, especially in the Cascade Mountains of the
northwestern United States.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanos were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting, but something that happened
somewhere else ... it caught everyone by surprise, even the
geologists who work on it,'' Christiansen said.
   ``This is the first time we've had a real laboratory'' in modern
U.S. history to study volcanos, emergency reponse to eruptions and
the rebirth of a blast zone, said Cowlitz County Commissioner Van
Youngquist.
   ``Our entire state is in a better position now ... whether it's
St. Helens or another Cascade volcano'' that erupts, he said.
   Scientists recounted the earthquake pattern before Mount St.
Helens erupted May 18, 1980, with the fury of 2,500 Hiroshima bombs.
   The eruption, which killed 57 people and scarred a once-lush
landscape, still evokes searing memories but the commemoration also
celebrates nature's recovery power.
   About 400 people who participated in the rescue and recovery
operations were expected at a reunion dinner here tonight.
   The southwest Washington hamlet of Toutle is staging a special
edition of its Volcano Daze festival on Saturday and Sunday, hoping
for thousands of visitors.
   U.S. Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., and other dignitaries planned
to dedicate a $500 million dam Saturday on the north fork of the
Toutle River. The dam is designed to keep 258 million cubic yards
of volcanic sediment from clogging rivers and flooding lowlands.
   The Weyerhaeuser Co., which says it lost $68 million worth of
its trees in the eruption, is giving dignitaries tours to show the
greening of more than 45,000 acres it has replanted.
   Youngquist toured the volcano area by air Thursday.
   ``Going back now, I can never forget what it looked like when I
got a helicopter tour the morning after the eruption.'' he said.
``It was very eerie. A strong sulfur smell from the crater ...
Vehicles with victims in them. It was a shocking feeling one can
never forget.
   ``But there is also a sense of renewal. ... You can see insects
and birds and wildlife.''
   Federal, state and local governments have spent more than $1
billion on rescue, recovery and reconstruction since the blast.
   Officials at the main visitor center at Castle Rock are girding
for a major tourism boom as the slumbering volcano returns to the
front pages and news broadcasts. About 500,000 visitors come each
year. About 50,000 have scaled the 8,363-foot peak since it was
reopened to climbers three years ago.
   Most folks seem to remember precisely where they were on that
quiet Sunday morning when the mountain erupted. A few months after
waking from a century-long slumber, the mountain blew its top at
8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980.
   With the energy of a nuclear warhead of as much as 50 megatons,
the eruption ripped off 1,315 feet of the previously cone-shaped
peak.
   The eruption sent ash plumes miles into the atmosphere and ash
clouds turned day into night in eastern Washington. The blast
devastated more than 230 square miles in a fan-shaped swath north
and northwest of the volcano.
   Although part of the new 110,000-acre National Volcanic Monument
looks like a lunar landscape, life is returning. Some trees planted
after the eruption are 30 feet tall.
