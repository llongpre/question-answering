<LEADPARA>  As Japan's deadliest volcano eruption in 65 years snuffed out more lives and
destroyed entire villages, experts warned that the worst may be yet to come.; 
  Super-heated rock, pumice and volcanic ash belched from Mount Unzen, near
the atomic-bombed city of Nagasaki, for the third day today, raising the death
toll to 33. Houses on the flanks of the 4,485-foot mountain were burned to the
ground, and farmland was coated in a thick layer of volcanic dust as the fiery
mixture raced down the slopes at speeds up to 60 mph.  </LEADPARA>

EXPERTS FEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     According to Akira Kubodera, one of Japan's leading volcanologists, Mount
Unzen was likely to continue spewing death and destruction for another two to
six months. The lava flowing from the current eruption amounts to only about
10 percent of what blew out of the mountain the last time it erupted, in
1792.;    Kubodera's greatest fear, in fact, is a sudden halt in volcanic
activity.;    "The worst-case scenario is that the mountain becomes quiet all
of a sudden," Kubodera said. "That is a calm before the storm, which means an
enormous amount of magma is being accumulated inside the mountain so one
eruption will spew a tremendous amount of lava into the air, perhaps much
larger than what was seen on Monday, and cause horrible damage to the area."; 
  Other experts also have concluded that it's unlikely this episode is over.; 
  Tamagawa University volcano expert Takeyo Kosaka said lava fragments belched
out of the mountain were as hot as 300 degrees Fahrenheit. The intense heat
from a second eruption on Tuesday forced rescue operations to stop after 90
minutes.;    Because of the high temperatures, the bodies of only five of the
volcano's initial victims were retrieved. The heat generated by the continuing
eruptions was so severe that even soldiers wearing flame-resistant clothing
and traveling in armored tanks were unable to reach the other 28. Identifying
the dead has not yet been possible because they have been burned beyond
recognition, authorities said.;    An additional 17 people were hospitalized
with injuries, eight of them listed in critical condition. Officials at
hospitals in nearby Shimabara said victims were being brought in with burns
over most of their bodies, their clothing in shreds, crying for water.;   
Plans by the Ground Self-Defense Forces -- Japan's military -- to lift 1,000
rescue workers into the disaster area by helicopter also were abandoned when
organizers realized the whirling rotors stirred the thick ash covering the
ground, hindering all work.;    Television footage, mainly shot from
helicopters, showed an eerie, lifeless world of gray. Although the video was
in color, none appeared on the screen. Occasionally, an immobile arm or leg
could be seen protruding from the thick dust layer. Cars and vans had been
tossed off the roads like toys and were lying at crazy angles, broken and
burning.;    Takeshi Sato, a reporter for the Mainichi newspaper, which has
three staff members among the missing, described an unnerving motorcycle ride
he took in a desperate, fruitless attempt to locate his colleagues:;    "The
ashes lay about five centimeters (two inches) deep on top of the ground, and I
could feel the warmth through the soles of my shoes. The rain fell black.
Power poles, trees from five to seven meters (roughly the same distance in
yards) in diameter -- almost all standing things looked as if they had been
wrenched down by some giant force.";    So far, the Mount Unzen eruption is
the deadliest to have struck Japan since Hokkaido's Mount Tokachi blew up in
1926, killing 144 people and burying two villages beneath a sea of mud, rock
and lava.;    The worst volcanic eruption in Japan's history came from Mount
Unzen itself, 199 years ago. Records from the period say that as many as
15,000 people were killed, most of them drowned in a tidal wave generated by
the blast. That eruption also triggered an earthquake, which sent an entire
mountain range tumbling into nearby Ariake Bay.;    Authorities on the scene
at the current disaster said they presumed that among the 33 dead was Harry
Glicken, 33, a volcanologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Glicken, who was working with the Tokyo Metropolitan University, reportedly
escaped death in 1980 when he fled the Mount St. Helens eruption at the last
moment.  </TEXT>
