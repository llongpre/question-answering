   Children whose families escaped the
horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a
killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and
a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
   After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian
children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland
Elementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged by
teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other
pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
   ``There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said
sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. ``Everybody
was crying in my class.''
   Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,
armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the
school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds
before he shot himself to death.

   Despite warnings from other Justice Department
officials, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III remained blind to
ethical problems raised by his actions on behalf of lobbyist E.
Robert Wallach, the Justice Department says.
   The report, issued Tuesday, concludes that Meese violated federal
ethics standards. An attachment to the report shows more than 600
contacts between Meese and the San Francisco lawyer from the time
the Reagan administration came to power.
   Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. in 1981 and
1983 and his efforts on behalf of a proposed Mideast oil pipeline in
1985 were three instances in which his friendship with Wallach
``dictated'' federal actions, said the report by the department's
Office of Professional Responsibility.
   Wallach, who collected $1.3 million from Wedtech from 1982 to
1986, is awaiting trial in New York on racketeering and other
charges. He is accused of peddling his connection to Meese.

   Serial killer Ted Bundy's death warrant
for murdering a girl was signed minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court
rejected his appeal, and the mayor of the slain child's town said
the execution would prompt celebrations.
   In signing the warrant, Gov. Bob Martinez set the execution for
Jan. 24 for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Diane
Leach, who was abducted in Lake City and was found dead in a pig sty.
   It was the fourth time the 42-year-old former law student has
been scheduled to die in Florida's electric chair. Bundy, whose case
was depicted in the television miniseries ``The Deliberate
Stranger,'' has come within hours of being executed only to win
postponement.
   His attorneys said after Tuesday's 7-2 high court decision they
would pursue further appeals.
   Bundy also has also been sentenced to death for killing two women
in a Florida State University sorority house in Tallahassee three
weeks before Kimberly's murder. He has been linked to up to 36 sex
murders or disappearances of young women, most in Utah, Colorado and
Washington state.

   Volcanoes killed more people in the '80s
than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near
their slopes, a geologist says.
   ``We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the
world,'' said Robert Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who
coordinated the agency's response to the Mount St. Helens eruption.
   ``Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively
reliable. We just don't do enough of it.''
   Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows
_ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation,
Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000
people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows
_ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from Mexico's El Chichon in
1982, Tilling said. Mount St. Helens left 57 people dead or missing
in 1980.

   Multimillionaire Robert Hearin has paid $1
million in ransom and spent six anguish-filled months awaiting word
on his kidnapped wife, and neighbors say it might be time to accept
she'll never return.
   ``For fear of sounding callous, I don't want to say that. But yet
I think as time goes by, people are becoming increasingly despondent
about the chances'' of solving 73-year-old Annie Laurie Hearin's
disappearance, Julia Yandell said Tuesday.
   Yandall and others in Jackson's posh Woodland Hills neighborhood
have been on edge since July 26, when Mrs. Hearin was abducted from
her home.
   FBI agents also aren't as optimistic as they were a few months
ago.
   ``We're pursuing leads. New things develop all the time, but
nothing at this time looks real promising,'' said FBI agent Stewart
Murphy.
