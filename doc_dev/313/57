   Airline flights were canceled and
residents marveled at a spectacular light show, as Redoubt Volcano
shot ash as high as 40,000 feet in its biggest eruption since
waking from a 25-year sleep.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory said the eruption at 5:50 p.m.
Tuesday was Redoubt's biggest since seismic activity began Dec. 13.
   Pilots reported a plume as high as 40,000 feet and said lava
appeared to be flowing down the volcano's northwest flank 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage, observatory scientists said.
   A radio station near Kenai, across Cook Inlet from the volcano,
was swamped with calls from people who saw lights in the sky.
   ``We've had listeners on the air reporting what looked like
heated, falling stones,'' said John Davis of station KSRM. He said
people parked their cars near inlet beaches to watch the display.
   Geologist Robert McGimsey of the observatory in Anchorage said
it was possible the reported lava flow was a mixture of ash and hot
gas. He said scientists would have to wait until daylight to
investigate.
   The volcano spewed an ``extensive ash plume,'' McGimsey said.
Another geologist at the observatory, Don Richter, said late
Tuesday night that it appeared most of the ash had settled before
reaching populated areas.
   Richter said ``a number of strong but less severe (seismic)
events'' occurred at about 8 p.m.
   ``It looks like it may keep up this level of explosive
activity'' today, he said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration advised pilots to
``continually evaluate operations to and from Anchorage.'' A number
of flights scheduled for Tuesday night and this morning were
canceled, and some night flights were diverted to other airports.
   Scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock.
The peak erupted three weeks ago and spewed ash 33,000 feet into
the air the next day. Varying levels of seismic activity continued
through the month.
   Last month, Christmas travelers and mail were delayed and
Anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines Boeing 747 flew through ash, lost power to all four
engines and fell more than two miles. The plane made a safe
emergency landing after the engines were restarted.
   The habitation nearest the volcano, the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles away, was evacuated Tuesday when scientists
issued warnings about the upcoming eruption, the Alaska Division of
Emergency Services said. About 11 people usually are assigned to
the facility.
   Richter said the lights observed by people on the Kenai
Peninsula are common after eruptions.
   ``There's been a lot of electrical discharging in that eruption
column _ a large electrical buildup,'' he said.
   Mark Norgren, who lives on a bluff about seven miles north of
Kenai, said he saw ``three or four occasions of bolt lightning''
during a 45-minute period soon after the eruption.
   ``It's like a flash that radiates throught the cloud,'' he said.
``When it comes through the cloud, it just illuminates the whole
sky.''
