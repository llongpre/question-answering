<HEAD>Volcano Erupts After Nearly 200 Years Dormant</HEAD>

   Steam and hot mud spewed Sunday from a volcano that
was dormant since causing one of Japan's largest natural disasters
nearly 200 years ago.
   No injuries have been reported since Mount Unzen erupted
Saturday, and no evacuations were reported. The volcano is about
510 miles southwest of Tokyo on the island of Kyushu.
   The eruption also did not appear to worry tourists visiting hot
springs near the crater. The town of Unzen, about 2{ miles from the
volcano, currently has about 3,000 tourists, said Unzen Tourist
Association spokesman Tadakiyo Kato.
   ``All the rooms at Unzen hotels are full,'' Kato said. ``We have
been booked solid because of the autumn tourist season, and no one
has canceled out because of the eruption.''
   The 4,458-foot volcano, composed of several volcanic peaks, last
erupted in 1792, killing 15,000 people in the worst volcano-related
disaster in Japanese history. Many of the deaths were caused by a
huge landslide and tidal waves.
   Scientists and local police refused to make predictions on the
eruption, but said they were preparing for the worst.
   Lava flows are not expected, but ``it is impossible to tell for
certain,'' said an official at the Mount Unzen Observatory, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Twin plumes of steam and ash rose hundreds of yards into the
air. Observatory seismographs recorded temblors too weak to be felt
by humans.
   Mount Unzen is one of 19 active volcanoes in Japan designated as
potentially dangerous and under constant observation by the
Meteorological Agency.
