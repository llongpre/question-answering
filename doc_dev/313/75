<LEADPARA>  More commercial airplanes are flying over active volcanoes, making it vital to
learn more about the ash plumes that can snuff out engines, experts say.;   
"There's a driving need to prevent a major aviation accident which has not yet
happened," Donald Engen, former administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Tuesday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Engen was the keynote speaker at the first International Symposium on
Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety. About 200 experts on flight, volcanoes and
weather attended the gathering.;    As transpacific air traffic is growing,
commercial flights to Asia from the United States and Europe fly over the
geologically turbulent Pacific rim known as the "Ring of Fire," which includes
parts of North and South America, Japan and New Zealand.;    Pilots sometimes
fly into ash plumes without realizing it because the ash often can't be
distinguished from other clouds by radar.;    Participants in the conference,
which continues through Thursday, will present new ways of tracking ash
clouds, including improved radar and satellite surveillance.;    The symposium
was organized after the 1989 eruption of Mount Redoubt in Alaska, but it took
on new importance with the devastating June eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the
Philippines.;    So far, at least 15 jetliners have flown into ash from
Pinatubo, said U.S. Geological Survey scientist Thomas Casadevall. Ten engines
had to be replaced because of ash damage, said Ernest Campbell, a manager with
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.;    Several commercial aircraft have had
close calls with disaster.;    One, a KLM 747 with 245 people on board, lost
all four engines and flew powerless for nearly six minutes after hitting ash
from Mount Redoubt on Dec. 15, 1989. The pilots managed to restart the engines
and land safely in Anchorage.;    Virtually every part of the KLM jet was
damaged. The ash ruined engines, sandblasted windshields and wings, clogged
air and water systems and contaminated electronics and hydraulics. The repair
bill was $80 million, Campbell said. The plane cost about $130 million new.;  
 Thomas Miller of the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage said the state
has nearly 70 volcanoes. At least one eruption a year can be expected, he
said.;    "This should not be looked at as some rare phenomenon," he said.  </TEXT>
