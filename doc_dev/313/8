   Ten years after its massive eruption, there is a
50-50 chance Mount St. Helens will explode its dome again within
three decades, a University of Washington seismologist says.
   Steve Malone, a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the
Pacific Northwest, said Thursday that Mount St. Helens is the most
likely volcano in the Cascade Mountains to erupt in the next 20 to
30 years.
   ``Our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since
Mount St. Helens erupted,'' he said.
   Malone said seismic activity, which the predication is largely
based on, is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it
indicates the breaking of rock below the earth's surface as molten
material rises underneath the volcano.
   The probability of eruption increases with the frequency and
magnitude of the earthquakes, he said.
   The May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens killed 57 people,
devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the
globe.
