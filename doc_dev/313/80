   A volcano that inspired the legend of the
lost civilization of Atlantis triggered summer frost, crop failure
and famine a half a world away, scientists said.
   The link enabled NASA scientists to date one of the most
powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history.
   Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about
3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of
Santorini volcano, which destroyed much of the Aegean island of
Thera, near what became Greece.
   The eruption was dated to 1600 B.C., give or take 30 years, by
researchers headed by astronomer Kevin Pang of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Pang presented the findings Tuesday during an American Geophysical
Union meeting.
   ``Not only are we able to get a date for this eruption _ if
people agree on the same century that's pretty good _ but we now
actually have eyewitness accounts of what happened (to the weather
thousands of miles away in China) after the Thera-Santorini
eruption,'' Pang said.
   NASA said effects of Santorini's blast were felt around the
world, and Thera's destruction is believed to be the source of
Plato's story of Atlantis, which tells of an island civilization
submerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes.
   ``Recent archaeological studies suggest that `Atlantis' may have
been Minoan centers on Crete, destroyed by tidal waves from the
Thera-Santorini eruption,'' Pang said.
   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Bob Tilling called Pang's
study ``kind of neat. He has another line of evidence linking
climatic effects to that eruption. ... We need to get a better idea
of how often these large eruptions take place and whether there is
any pattern to them. That gives us a much better basis to forecast
possible future eruptions.''
   Pang said Santorini's eruption packed the punch of ``2 million
Hiroshima atomic bombs going off at the same time. Santorini was
roughly 100 times more powerful than Krakatau (Indonesia, 1883).
Mount St. Helens is a little bitty volcano compared with this.''
   Pang and NASA called the Thera-Santorini explosion the most
powerful volcano eruption in recorded history. Tilling said he was
unsure of the latest estimates, but ``it is clearly one of the
largest.''
   The volcano spewed sunlight-blocking debris and acid aerosols,
chilling Earth's climate to cause disturbances noted in historical
accounts of the reign of King Jie, the last king of the Xia
dynasty, which is China's earliest recorded dynasty.
   ``At the time of King Jie, the sun was dimmed,'' the annals say.
``Three suns appeared (due to ice crystals in the atmosphere
refracting the sun's image). ... Winter and summer came
irregularly. ... Frosts formed in the sixth month (July on the
Chinese calendar). ... The five cereals withered. ... Therefore
famine occurred. ... There was heavy rainfall and communities were
destroyed.''
   Cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptions
of Indonesia's Tambora in 1815, Iceland's Laki in 1783 and another
Iceland volcano in 208 B.C., Pang said.
   After finding references to Santorini's climatic effects in the
Xia dynasty histories, Pang and his colleagues dated those
references using Shang Dynasty ``oracle bones'' _ genealogies
inscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades _ and Western
Zhou royal genealogies.
   The genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomical
events to the reigns of certain kings. In one case, Pang found a
historical account of a day that dawned twice that must have been
April 21, 899 B.C., when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse.
   Pang said previous studies used volcano-caused excesses of
sulfuric acid in ice cores from Greenland to estimate Thera erupted
happened between 1670 B.C. and 1620 B.C., compared with his date
range of 1630 B.C. to 1570 B.C. Stunted growth rings in Irish oak
trees and North American pines put it between 1613 B.C. and 1631
B.C.
   ``Some date it as late as the 14th century B.C. and some date it
as early as the 18th century B.C.,'' he said. ``Now all the methods
are converging on the late 17th century B.C.''
   Pang conducted the study with physicist Santosh Srivastava and
computer scientist Robert Keston of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and
Hung-hsiang Chou, an Asian languages professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
