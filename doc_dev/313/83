<HEAD>Arkansas School District Takes Quake Prediction Seriously</HEAD>

   A northeast Arkansas school district is
taking a forecaster's prediction to heart and has tentatively
planned an early December earthquake break.
   The South Mississippi County School District No. 57 won't hold
classes on Dec. 3-4, if the school board approves, in deference to
climatologist Iben Browning's prediction of a major earthquake
along the New Madrid Fault during that time.
   Browning claims to have accurately predicted last fall's
Northern California earthquake within one day. He also says he
correctly predicted the 1971 earthquake in California's San
Fernando Valley, a deadly earthquake in Nicaragua in 1972 and
eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980.
   South Mississippi County Superintendent Harvey Barton said he is
taking Browning seriously. Browning has predicted a quake for Dec.
2 or 3, a Sunday and Monday. The district, north of Memphis, Tenn.,
has canceled classes on Dec. 3 and 4. It will use that time for
staff development days mandated by the state Department of
Education, Barton said.
   ``Because we are a large rural area covering approximately 400
square miles, transporting students would be a hardship if we
should have an earthquake,'' Barton said.
   The New Madrid seismic zone stretches roughly from northeast
Arkansas northward to southern Illinois.
   Communities that make up the South Mississippi County School
District are within 30 miles of Marked Tree, the center of a series
of great earthquakes measuring as high as 8.5 on the Richter scale
that rocked the area during the winter of 1811-12. U.S. Geological
Survey scientists consider those the strongest series of quakes in
the nation's recorded history.
