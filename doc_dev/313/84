<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; JAPAN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mount Unzen continued to smolder, shudder and spew lava today, and one expert
said the thousands of people who evacuated homes at its foot will not return
for months, perhaps years.;    Newspapers published pictures of the volcano's
Monday eruption taken by photographers among the 38 people killed in the
sudden storm of searing gas, molten ash and rock.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Three nationally circulated newspapers, the Yomiuri, Mainichi and Nikkei,
published such pictures, some of which were marred by black holes and marks
where the film apparently was damaged by the heat.;    The body of one
photographer, Tadahoshi Tsuchiya, 58, was identified by his wristwatch, its
glass cover blown off and the hands stopped at 4:18 p.m., the time the
4,452-foot volcano erupted.;    "He must have suffered terribly -- it must
have been unbearably hot," his wife, Tsukimi, 56, said after seeing his body,
according to the Yomiuri newspaper.;    Tremors and smoke;    The mountain 600
miles southwest of Tokyo remained relatively quiet today, although it shook
with minor tremors and billowed thick, white smoke and a thin stream of lava
trickled out.;    Since Monday's eruption, about 800 soldiers in silver
flame-retardant gear have been searching for bodies in the volcanic debris
spread across the mountain's eastern face.;    Rescue helicopters today lifted
one more body from its ash-covered slopes. Fear of a new eruption slowed the
effort. Only 27 bodies have been recovered, according to news reports. Six
other people died in hospitals.;    Relatives and friends have helped identify
21 bodies, including those of three foreign volcano experts, said police in
Nagasaki, 30 miles to the west. Officials said many of the victims were burned
beyond recognition.;    Foreigners identified;    The three foreigners were
volcanologist Harry Glicken, 33, of the University of California, Santa
Barbara; and Maurice Krafft, 45, and his wife, Katia, 44, a French couple who
had been tracking the world's most active and dangerous volcanoes for 25
years.;    Krafft, one of France's leading volcanologists, had once said if he
had to die, "I want it to be at the edge of a volcano.";    Volcano experts
warned that a huge amount of magma, or underground molten rock, inside Mount
Unzen could produce another large eruption. Lodged in the crater was a
tongue-shaped lava rock about 230-260 feet wide.  </TEXT>
