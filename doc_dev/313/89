   Redoubt Volcano fussed and fumed quietly
Monday, and scientists planned to install new seismic sensors on
the peak's flanks, the Alaska Volcano Observatory reported.
   Late Sunday, the 10,197-foot volcano 115 miles southwest of
Anchorage was emitting a steam plume to about 14,500 feet, said
geologist C. Dan Miller. The plume contains little or no ash, and
seismic activity in and beneath the volcano remained low, he said.
   He said the observatory planned to put three crews on and near
the mountain Monday.
   One was to install two seismic sensors on the volcano's flanks,
the second was to survey sections of the Drift River Valley to look
at past mud flows to determine flooding hazards.
   A terminal for Cook Inlet oil is located at the mouth of the
Drift River.
   Redoubt has caused flooding in the Drift River several times
since it started erupting in mid-December. Federal scientists have
warned the state that Redoubt could cause a flood big enough to
carry large blocks of ice and rock crashing into oil storage tanks,
or wash out a buried oil pipeline.
   The third crew plans to investigate deposits left by eruptions
on Jan. 2 and Jan. 8, Miller said.
