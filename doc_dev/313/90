   Redoubt Volcano erupted anew Thursday,
sending a jet of ash and steam nearly seven miles high and
scattering grit that led authorities to cancel classes for 2,000
students.
   The ``moderate to strong'' eruption, the first significant
eruption since Jan. 15, began around 4 a.m. and was over in minutes.
   The ash cloud headed for the Gulf of Alaska, away from the more
populated Cook Inlet area, said Tom Miller, a spokesman for the
U.S. Geological Survey.
   The Federal Aviation Administration warned aircraft to stay at
least 20 miles from the mountain, which is about 115 miles
southeast of Anchorage.
   But Ken Burdette, manager of Anchorage International Airport,
said no airline had canceled or diverted flights because of the
ash, which can damage or shut down aircraft engines.
   ``Redoubt should not affect any carriers, international and
domestic,'' Burdette said. ``The cloud's going away from the major
airways that come and go into Anchorage.''
   Classes were canceled for health reasons at more than a dozen
schools from Nikiski southward on the Kenai Peninsula, which got a
``pretty good dumping'' of ash, said Dale Sandahl, superintendent
of the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District.
   The mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays. Ash clogged all four engines of a
KLM Boeing 747 on Dec. 15, causing the aircraft to fall more than
two miles before the engines could be restarted.
   Redoubt showed more earthquake activity a couple of days ago,
leading seismologists to believe another eruption was coming, said
John Davies, state seismologist. ``But not this soon,'' he said.
   More than two dozen workers were evacuated early Thursday from
the Drift River oil terminal, a tank farm just a few miles from the
mountain.
   ``We got them out just before the eruption,'' said Larry
Duncanson, with Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co. which operates the storage
terminal.
