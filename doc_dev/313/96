<LEADPARA>  As thousands of U.S. military dependents left bases covered with ash from
Mount Pinatubo, Filipinos today confronted monumental chores that began with
securing clean drinking water.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said the volcano was
"simmering down" after a week of violent eruptions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Significant, critical eruptions are probably over," the institute
announced.;    Punongbayan said he might recommend reducing the 25-mile danger
zone around the volcano, but he cautioned that Pinatubo remained a threat. The
institute said it would continue its alert at least until the volcano had
remained quiet for a week.;    The Philippine Red Cross said at least 101
people have been killed since the 4,795-foot volcano began spewing ash, steam
and super-heated rocks June 9 for the first time in 600 years.;    Most of the
victims were killed in a huge explosion Saturday that dumped ash as far as 375
miles away. The damage was aggravated by rains, and scores of buildings
collapsed in nearby towns and cities.;    At least 20 people were missing
today. Relief efforts have been complicated by impassable roads and ash clouds
that grounded aircraft all weekend.;    Defense Undersecretary Eduardo Ermita
said food was in short supply in the affected areas and water supplies had
been polluted by ash. Officials ordered Manila's fire department to transport
drinking water to towns hit hardest by the volcano.;    In Japan, a volcano
that claimed at least 39 lives earlier this month burst back to life today,
sending a torrent of hot rocks down the mountainside and spewing ash over a
hot springs resort.;    There were no reports of casualties from the latest
blast of Mount Unzen, but the Meteorological Agency warned of the likelihood
of additional eruptions of lava chunks and super-heated gas and rocks.;   
Since the fatal June 3 blast, volcanic ash from Mount Unzen has blanketed the
town of Shimabara at the eastern foot of the 4,480-foot volcano, 610 miles
southwest of Tokyo.  </TEXT>
