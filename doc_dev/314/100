<LEADPARA>  U.S. officials Sunday launched an emergency evacuation to the United States of
about 20,000 military dependents and civilian workers from two strategic bases
after a deadly 36-hour string of eruptions at Mount Pinatubo.;    At least 76
people have been killed since the volcano began erupting June 9 for the first
time in 600 years, the Red Cross said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The first 900 of the evacuees boarded U.S. warships Sunday at Subic Bay
Naval Station and departed for Cebu, a southern Philippine city about 350
miles from Manila, where they were scheduled to board planes for the United
States.;    Even as the evacuation order was issued, Philippine volcano
scientists said that the worst of Mount Pinatubo's eruptions may be over,
despite a prediction Saturday that the volcano was on the verge of a major
explosion.;    The scientists said that much of the pressure built up in the
volcano had dissipated this weekend in the emission of vast clouds of ash and
rock that turned day to night across the island of Luzon, and in a series of
earthquakes, including one that rocked skyscrapers in downtown Manila on
Sunday.;    The ash combined with rain from a tropical storm Saturday and left
a slippery glaze on buildings and roads as far away as Manila, about 50 miles
south of the volcano.;    Panicked residents of villages close to the volcano
trudged on foot through knee-deep ash Saturday to escape the rumbling volcano.
Mudslides washed out bridges, clogged highways and caused hundreds of homes to
collapse.;    The international and domestic airports in the capital remained
closed Sunday out of concern that the ash would damage jet engines.;    Last
week, the Pentagon announced that about 7,000 dependents of military and
civilian workers at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base would be evacuated from the
Philippines to the United States. Clark, one of the largest American military
bases outside the United States, is 10 miles east of the volcano and has been
shut down since last Monday.;    Sunday's expanded evacuation order includes
all civilian workers at Clark and at Subic Bay, as well as all dependents from
both installations.;    "The only ones left will be uniformed Army, Air Force,
Navy or Marine personnel," said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a spokesman at Subic.
"You'll have to be in uniform to stay.";    Workers to remain at Subic;   
Military officials said that about 12,000 uniformed military workers were
stationed at the bases before the volcano erupted, and that most would remain
behind at Subic while their families and the civilian employees left the
Philippines.;    Virtually all of the 16,000 base workers at Clark and their
family members were evacuated to Subic Bay last week.;    The chief spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, Stanley Schrager, said the evacuation had been
ordered because "it's just untenable to have 30,000 people at Subic, double
the ordinary population, especially given the uncertainty over the volcano and
over the future of Clark as to when these people would be able to go home.";  
 On Sunday, Clark looked like a vast moonscape, with about six inches of
concrete-like volcanic ash covering roads, roofs and runways. Ragged scrubland
and manicured lawns had the same bleak blanket of hard gray crust.;    'A
wasteland';    "Everything looks like a wasteland," said Philippine Brig. Gen.
Leopoldo Acot Jr., commander of about 150 Philippine troops guarding the
nearly deserted base.;    On Saturday, volcanic ash and a hail of inch-long
pebbles emitted by Mount Pinatubo shut down operations at Subic Bay and
damaged about 100 buildings, half of them seriously.;    Two people -- a
9-year-old American girl and a Filipino -- were reported killed late Saturday
when the roof of their shelter at Subic collapsed under the weight of the
ash.;    "We don't have snow here, and the roofs are not designed to hold
anything," Mukri said. "You get an event like this only about every 600 years.
It's not something you plan for.";    In the city of Olongapo, near the Subic
base, eight people were reported killed when the roof of a hospital collapsed
late Saturday because of ash deposits. Six people died when a church collapsed
in Dau, near Clark.;    Readiness unaffected;    U.S. officials said the
evacuation of base workers from Clark and Subic would not affect military
readiness in the Pacific. All jet fighters had been withdrawn from Clark in
recent months as a result of a global redeployment of forces by the Pentagon.;
   But the volcano is expected to affect the final round of negotiations
between the United States and the Philippines over an extension of the joint
lease for the two bases, which expires in September. U.S. officials say Clark
may not be able to assume normal operations for months, if not years.;   
There appears to be no similar doubt about the future of Subic, which could
reopen fully within the next few weeks.;    Philippine scientists said Sunday
it appeared that a section of the crater on Mount Pinatubo had collapsed on
itself, releasing pressure that might otherwise have produced a cataclysmic
avalanche of molten rock.;    Forecast withdrawn;  On Saturday, the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology had predicted such an explosion after
obtaining satellite photos showing a nearly two-mile fissure along the
southern edge on the volcano. But Sunday it withdrew the ominous forecast.;   
The evacuation from Subic began Sunday afternoon, when 900 Americans, mostly
wives and children from Clark, boarded the cruiser Arkansas and two frigates,
the Rodney M. Davies and the Kurtz, bound for Cebu.;    Military officials
said the evacuees would probably be flown by chartered jets from the
international airport at Cebu to an American air base on Guam, and, from
there, to the United States. Plans to evacuate the Americans by plane from the
Cubi Point naval air station, which adjoins Subic Bay, were foiled by the
ash.;    The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, leading a battle group out
of Okinawa on the way to the Persian Gulf, is to assist in the evacuation,
which is expected to last a week to 10 days, U.S. officials said.  </TEXT>
