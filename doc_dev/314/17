   Volcanoes killed more people in the '80s
than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near
their slopes, a geologist says.
   ``We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the
world,'' said Robert Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who
coordinated the agency's response to the Mount St. Helens eruption.
   ``Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively
reliable. We just don't do enough of it.''
   Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows
_ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation,
Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000
people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows
_ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from Mexico's El Chichon in
1982, Tilling said. Mount St. Helens left 57 people dead or missing.
   In 1902, pyroclastic flows killed 29,000 near Mount Pelee in
Martinique, 6,000 near Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala, and 1,560
in the eruption of Soufriere on St. Vincent, said Tilling, who is
based in Washington, D.C.
   His count shows 13,080 more died during the six other deadly
eruptions this century: three volcanoes in 1951 and three others in
1911, 1919 and 1963.
   An average of 50 of Earth's 600 volcanoes erupt each year, most
without fatalities, and the rate ``has not changed much in
historical times. But because the world population has exploded ...
to 5 billion in 1987, the problem posed by volcanic and associated
hazards is greater now than ever before,'' he said.
   He said more than 350 millon people live on or within danger
range of volcanoes _ about 14 percent of the population.
   ``We spend a lot of effort at a few volcanoes _ and we need to,''
Tilling said in an interview. ``But we're not applying existing
(monitoring) technology to more volcanoes, especially in developing
countries where the risks and hazards are the greatest.''
   And, he said, the most dangerous volcanoes are the least studied.
   Part of the problem, Tilling said, is that volcanoes erupt
infrequently compared with natural hazards such as earthquakes,
major storms, floods and landslides.
   ``However in populated areas, even very small eruptions can wreak
havoc and cause widespread devastation'' such as the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption.
   The mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as Mount St.
Helens' May 18, 1980, explosion. But the tiny Colombian eruption
melted glacial ice, burying Armero and other towns under mudflows,
he said.
   Tilling urged an international effort to reduce volcano deaths.
The National Academy of Science and United Nations previously have
endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated
the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction.
   To reduce volcano deaths, scientists must identify high-risk
mountains, study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur
and whether the eruptions were explosive, map the routes of killer
flows to identify danger zones, then install monitoring equipment
where necessary to listen for earthquakes, uplift and tilting, and
other signs of activity.
   Asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring,
Tilling replied: ``There's the question.''
   Tilling said the 10 most deadly eruptions since A.D. 1000 were:
   _Tambora, Indonesia, 1815, 92,000 deaths, including 80,000 from
starvation.
   _Krakatau, Indonesia, 1883, 36,420 killed by tsunamis, or
volcanic tidal waves.
   _Mount Pelee, Martinique, 1902, 29,000 dead.
   _Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia, 1985, at least 22,000.
   _Vesuvius, Italy, 1631, 18,000 killed.
   _Unzen, Japan, 1792, 15,190 tsunami deaths.
   _Etna, Italy, 1169, 15,000 fatalities.
   _Kelut, Indonesia, 1586, 10,000 killed.
   _Etna again in 1669, 10,000 more victims.
   _Lakagigar, Iceland, 1783, 9,340 lives lost.
