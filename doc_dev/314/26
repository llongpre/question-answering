   Entrepreneurs have turned the ash from
Mount St. Helens into everything from gemstones to Jesus in the
last decade, and volcano kitsch still is a hot seller.
   Ash is Washington state's answer to the velvet Elvises and straw
cowboy hats that lure tourist dollars in other areas.
   When Sally Warren surveyed the ruined cucumbers in her Woodland
garden that May day in 1980, she never imagined Mount St. Helen's
ash would one day put money in her pocket.
   But 10 years after the eruption, Ms. Warren and a partner
continue to make and sell porcelain figures containing some of the
ash. It is one of several businesses born of the volcano.
   ``A little economy has definitely developed and grown from using
this Mount St. Helen's ash,'' said Mary Mains, whose company makes
jewelry from it.
   Inventive residents put the ash in everything from pottery to
earrings to Christmas ornaments, paperweights and pens. There are
even ash-colored volcanoes with little ash smoke plumes coming out
the top.
   They sell to tourists and to Washington residents seeking gifts
for out-of-state friends, said Kay Thomas, owner of a gift shop in
this city about 100 miles east of the volcano. The lure is the
volcano connection.
   ``I wish I had known you could do wonderful things with it,''
Ms. Thomas said of the ash that piled up on her roof. ``I would
have sold it.''
   Other people immediately saw the potential. Workers who went up
the mountain to salvage the engines of destroyed logging trucks
learned their cutting torches would melt the ash into a green stone.
   That discovery prompted Ms. Mains to found a new branch of her
retail business, The Emerald Fox.
   She keeps five employees busy producing ``Emerald Obsidianite''
jewelry made by melting the ash at 2,700 degrees in an oxygen-free
environment. The jewelry is sold over the United States, she said.
   The ash is not actually ash, but rock dust that is largely
composed of silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium and at least
12 other elements, she said.
   Chromium and iron, when heated, give the stone its rich green
color, making it a dead ringer for emeralds, she said. They are so
close in appearance that New York City jewelry stories, concerned
about security, use the stones in window displays as a substitute
for emeralds.
   The jewelry, priced from $30 to more than $200, may indeed
attract buyers because of its beauty.
   The same cannot be said for the $2 pens whose plastic bodies are
filed with ash. Or what looks like a clump of wet sand in the form
of a tiny smoldering volcano. Only hard-core ash enthusiasts could
love those.
   And all ash is not created equal.
   The debris from different eruptions came from different depths
of the Earth and reacts differently to processing.
   Ms. Warren and partner Fay Miller make their porcelain figures
with ash gathered from the June 12, 1980, eruption, rather than the
May eruption.
   ``It's more like sand,'' she said. ``The first eruption was more
like talcum powder. It made it look muddy.''
   Ms. Mains disdains the 1980 ash altogether, preferring for her
jewelry a 1981 vintage believed to have come from 10 to 20 miles
below the Earth's surface.
   Fred Ybarra, a gemologist in Yakima, said many people still come
into his shop offering to sell their ash. He can't use it but said
that items made from ash would eventually become more valuable as
the ash supply runs out.
   Ms. Warren uses about 2 tablespoons of ash for every gallon of
porcelain she mixes up. Her husband shoveled up a large amount of
ash shortly after the eruptions, and they keep it in gallon jars at
their home.
   ``We've got enough for another 40 years,'' she said.
