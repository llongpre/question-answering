   Redoubt Volcano's tantrums have not
been as destructive as Mount St. Helens', but they have interrupted
oil production and international travel and closed schools for
thousands of youngsters.
   Earlier this week, 10,000 face masks were distributed to
residents of the central Kenai Peninsula worried about inhaling the
fine volcanic ash _ gritty, highly abrasive bits of pulverized lava
_ that the volcano has blown as high as eight miles into the
atmosphere.
   ``The quake activity indicates the volcano is relatively quiet
for now and it does not appear to be building toward stronger
eruptive activity,'' geologist Steve Brantley of the Alaska Volcano
Observatory said Wednesday. Still, a major eruption like last
Monday's is possible, he said.
   There's no telling how long the seismic activity will continue,
and the mountain could spew ash intermittently for years, Brantley
said.
   Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted explosively in May
1980, levelling hundreds of square miles of forest, blowing ash so
high into the atmosphere it circled the globe, killing 57 people
and causing over $3 billion in damage.
   Redoubt, which roared back to life Dec. 14 after 25 years of
quiet, is not only smaller but also more remote, sitting 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   But it still has the power to disrupt commerce and everyday life.
   Redoubt's threat forced the closure Tuesday of the Drift River
oil storage terminal, 20 miles from the volcano, and much of the
Cook Inlet offshore oil field that the facility serves.
   The terminal, with 38 million gallons of oil in its tanks, sits
near the Drift River, which has overflowed with water from snow and
glaciers melted by Redoubt's internal heat. The river flooded
extensively during the volcano's last eruption.
   The affected fields contributed much of the $23.3 million in
royalties Alaska collected last year from Cook Inlet production,
said said Chuck Logsden, a petroleum economist with the Department
of Revenue.
   Because the airborne ash threatens aircraft engines, traffic at
Anchorage International Airport came to a virtual halt shortly
before Christmas, stranding hundreds of passengers and Christmas
mail deliveries, and was patchy after another eruption Jan. 2.
   Redoubt's ash shut down all four engines on a KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines 747, and the big jet glided from 25,000 to 12,000 feet in
12 minutes before the crew could get the engines restarted.
   Although recent ash eruptions have spared air routes leading to
Anchorage, some international carriers that used Anchorage as a
refueling stop continue to divert planes elsewhere.
   The diversions are being felt in the city, where airline crews
stay in hotels and shop.
   ``It is during December and January that hotels are most
appreciative of the airline business,'' said Forest J. Paulson,
general manager of the Sheraton Anchorage Hotel. Alaska gets few
tourists during the winter.
   There is concern that international carriers that rerouted
because of the volcano will find the alternative refueling stops
desirable and stick with them. Since Redoubt came to life, Soviet
officials have been opening Siberian routes more readily than
before, said Jon Ungar, controller for the Alaska International
Airport System.
   Even on the ground, street traffic on the central Kenai
Peninsula is affected by the ash.
   ``We've had a lot of requests for filter changes,'' said Lewis
Fowler, manager of Tom's Automotive in Soldotna. Engine problems
and auto-body corrosion are among the foremost concerns, he said.
   Health problems have been not been overwhelming, but they
include nosebleeds among people who work outdoors and an increase
in respiratory ailments among the elderly, said Dr. George Garnett,
a health adviser to Kenai Peninsula Borough.
   The ash is like finely broken glass, Garnett said.
   ``Microscopically, it is actually harder than glass,'' he said.
Inhalation can result in tiny, internal cuts that create irritation.
   School closures in effect at least through Thursday affected
more than 5,000 students, partly for health reasons and partly to
keep the dusty grit outside.
   On the other hand, the tourism industry sees a potential ray of
economic sunshine.
   ``We've been talking about the fact that there are some tour
companies that might see Redoubt as an attraction _ `Come see the
little volcano that did,''' said Keith Fernandez, marketing
director for the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if some enterprising business said,
`Yeah, I bet I could make it work.'''
