<HEAD>Mount St. Helens Approaches Two Years Without A Burp</HEAD>

   Mount St. Helens is approaching a landmark of
sorts: two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash, or
even burps of lava.
   The last ``eruptive episode'' occurred Oct. 21-24, 1986, when
the southwest Washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the
lava dome that sits in its gaping crater.
   The dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater, even though it
has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor.
   The volcano first stirred to life in this century in March 1980,
when it began venting steam and ash from its peak. Its May 18,
1980, eruption leveled 230 square miles of evergreen forest, left
57 people dead or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   It also knocked the top 1,300 feet off the peak, which is now
8,365 feet high.
   Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey cautioned, however,
that the quiet period does not necessarily mean the volcano has
lapsed into long-term inactivity.
   ``Mount St. Helens could erupt again at any time,'' said Don
Swanson, scientist in charge at the USGS observatory in Vancouver,
Wash.
   Throughout its recorded history, Mount St. Helens has had active
periods that lasted for years with relatively short spans of
inactivity. Before the 1980s, the last eruptive period was from
1800 to 1857, with intermittent periods of quiet lasting months or
years, according to the USGS western region office in Menlo Park,
Calif.
   The volcano's most recent eruptions have been quiet,
dome-building affairs, in which the mountain pumps out thick lava
to increase the size of the crater dome. Swanson said, however,
that explosive eruptions such as those in the spring and summer of
1980 remain possible.
   The last eruption added about 3 million cubic yards of material
to the dome, which now contains about 101 million cubic yards of
cooled lava and other volcanic material.
   Seismic activity also has decreased at the mountain, Swanson
said. The volcano and surrounding area are continuously monitored
for earthquake activity by a joint USGS-University of Washington
program.
   Since October 1986, seismic activity has remained at
``background levels,'' scientists said.
   Sulfur dioxide gas continues to escape from cracks in the lava
dome, but has also remained at inconsequential levels of less than
50 tons a day, Swanson said.
   By monitoring seismic activity and other signals, scientists
have correctly predicted 16 of the volcano's 17 dome-building
episodes.
