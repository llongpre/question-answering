   Mount Redoubt exploded Saturday morning
with perhaps its smallest blast to date, scientists said, but the
eruption is significant because it is part of an unusually stable
pattern.
   Geologist Steve Brantley, with the Alaska Volcano Observatory,
said the eruption at 6:11 a.m. ADT, sent steam and ash about 25,000
feet into the air. The volcano is about 110 miles southwest of
Anchorage. Light winds were not expected to carry ash to Anchorage.
   Redoubt's recurring stirrings happen about once every six or
nine days and are regular enough that the observatory now issues
warnings, predicting when the next blast will occur.
   It's been right _ or nearly right _ at least four times since
December.
   Saturday's eruption happened just six hours earlier than
predicted. Brantley said scientists had set the time window from
noon Saturday to noon Tuesday.
   ``Mount St. Helens never exhibited this kind of regular,
eruptive activity,'' Brantley said, referring to the destructive
volcano in Washington state.
   ``Kilauea Volcano (on the island of Hawaii) did produce many
eruptive episodes, several dozen that occurred at varying
intervals,'' he said. ``But there wasn't such a fixed pattern.''
   Lava from Kilauea destroyed three houses Friday and at least one
on Saturday.
   Brantley says Redoubt does not always give telltale warning
signs, such as heightened earthquakes at its base or discernible
swelling.
   Instead, scientists are adding up the number of explosions over
a certain period and basing their predictions on the average number
of days between explosions.
   ``It's interesting that it's in this pattern,'' Brantley said.
``Volcanoes do not usually do this.''
   He said geologists were 70 percent certain that an explosion
would occur sometime after noon Saturday.
   Redoubt erupted less than 14 hours after a light earthquake
shook the Denali National Park area, some 300 miles north of the
volcano.
   There were no immediate reports of damage. Brantley said the two
geologic events were unrelated.
