   VALLEY OF 10,000 SMOKES, Alaska (AP) _ They call this
wind-scoured place ``hell with the fires burned out,'' a desert of
pumice and ash piled 700 feet deep by the most powerful series of
volcanic blasts this century.
   Geologists continue trying to sort out the plumbing beneath
Novarupta Volcano, which erupted in June 1912 with a force 10 times
that of the Mount St. Helens explosion a decade ago.
   For the last two summers, a multiagency team of scientists has
been ferrying supplies and equipment by helicopter in and out of
this roadless and unique corner of the 4 million-acre Katmai
National Park and Preserve.
   The area was established in 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson,
who set aside an initial 1,700 square miles to preserve an area of
``importance to the study of volcanism.''
   Scientists want to pinpoint the size, shape and location of the
eruptive vent.
   ``It will help us predict eruptions, find ore deposits and
better understand the earth's process,'' said Tom Miller of the
Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage.
   But because the science is being gathered in a wilderness area,
the project is not without controversy.
   A dozen scientists were tiptoeing around this summer, trying not
to intrude on the wilderness experiences of backpackers trekking
more than a dozen miles to the shelter of two ramshackle huts on
Baked Mountain, near where the volcano is believed centered.
   Men and women who spent years in classrooms and labs earning
their doctorates spent several days on their hands and knees
re-roofing one of the huts as part of an agreement with the
National Park Service.
   The Park Service relaxed its rules for using a helicopter in the
Katmai backcountry in exchange for the work.
   Proposals to drill two holes deep into the body of the
still-warm volcano already have begun drawing fire, although the
environmental impact statement has not yet been written and public
hearings are at least a year away.
   ``I got a couple of letters about it, critical of the drilling a
few days ago,'' said Alan Eliason, Katmai's new superintendent. ``I
think they were written by people who used to work here.''
   When Robert Griggs first saw the valley that he appropriately
named the Valley of 10,000 Smokes, the sounds were deafening as
thousands of fumaroles, or vents, hissed and roared, spitting steam
and heat into the air.
   ``The whole valley as far as the eye could see was full of
hundreds, no thousands _ literally, tens of thousands _ of smokes
curling up from its fissured floor,'' said Griggs, who explored the
Ukak River valley in 1916 for the National Geographic Society.
   The valley is silent now, except for the wind. And most of the
fumaroles were extinct by the 1930s, although hikers can warm their
hands over a few small holes that emit odorless steam clouds near
the Novarupta vent.
   ``There are a couple around here that go about 80 degrees
Fahrenheit,'' John Eichelberger, chief scientist for the project,
said while guiding a reporter around.
   Except for several deep gorges and an endless number of gullies
cut by glacial or snow melt into the tan, brown and orange
moonscape, the 40-square-mile valley appears much as it did after
being cooked 78 years ago.
   The scent of sulfur from nearby Trident Volcano drifts faintly
on the wind as you stand surrounded by evidence of the fury of the
eruption.
   Even the place names tell a story: Baked Mountain. Broken
Mountain. Falling Mountain. Knife Creek.
   All are the physical reminders of an eruption that spawned ash
clouds so thick that they darkened skies over the Atlantic states,
dropped summer temperatures around the Northern Hemisphere an
average of 1.8 degrees and released acid rain on Vancouver, British
Columbia, disintegrating clothes drying on lines.
   ``Half of the eruptive volume blew up, sending ash into the
atmosphere. The other half, with larger fragments, blew a day or so
later and went laterally,'' Eichelberger said.
   ``It (gases, incandescent ash) moved at about 100 miles an hour
and built up hundreds of feet thick in only a few hours. It came
out of the ground at about 1,500 degrees.''
   Miraculously, no one died in the explosions, which were heard
clearly in Juneau, Alaska's capital 750 miles to the south.
   ``It was an exceedingly large and, as these things go,
relatively simple eruption,'' Eichelberger said.
   ``Normally, volcanoes are built up from hundreds of eruptions
over many years. With Katmai it was a single event. That's what
makes it so interesting to study.''
   Scientists can interpret the magnetic and seismic results
they've collected over the two summers of work, but they still
can't ``see'' into the earth, said Miller.
   ``We need to verify it,'' he said, ``and you can only do that
with something a kilometer or more down, and that's done with core
drilling.''
