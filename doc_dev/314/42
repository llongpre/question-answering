   Redoubt Volcano blew its top again
Tuesday and scientists said the eruption appeared to be larger than
those that occurred in December after the volcano emerged from a
25-year sleep.
   A pilot reported seeing ``lightning and fireworks'' and a plume
as high as 40,000 feet after the eruption occurred about 6 p.m.,
said David Stone, a geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano
Observatory in Fairbanks.
   Several pilots reported lava was flowing down the northwest
flank of the mountain 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, said
geologist Robert McGimsey of the Alaska Volcano Observatory in
Anchorage.
   McGimsey said it was possible the flow was actually a mixture of
ash and hot gas rather than lava. He said scientists would have to
wait until daylight to investigate.
   The volcano spewed an ``extensive ash plume,'' and it appeared
the ash generally remained in the area of Redoubt, McGimsey said.
Light winds blowing toward Anchorage were expected to shift
slightly to the south overnight, the National Weather Service said.
   Monitoring equipment on the volcano and elsewhere indicated a
strong eruption, Stone said.
   ``Normally, these things go on for some time, a matter of hours
or a day,'' Stone said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration advised pilots to
``continually evaluate operations to and from Anchorage.'' At least
one plane, a Delta Airlines flight scheduled from Seattle to
Anchorage, turned back after the pilot announced that the plume was
headed for Anchorage.
   Scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock.
After resting for a quarter of a century, the peak erupted Dec. 13
and spewed ash 33,000 feet into the air the next day. Varying
levels of seismic activity continued through the month.
   During last month's eruption, Christmas travelers and mail were
delayed and Anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 flew through ash, lost power to all
four engines and fell more than two miles. The plane made a safe
emergency landing after the engines were restarted.
   ``The seismicity is high enough that if the thing blew a plume
we wouldn't be surprised,'' McGimsey said Tuesday morning before
the second eruption.
   McGimsey said there was an increase in shallow earthquakes in
the volcano dome. More temblors occurred seven to 10 kilometers
beneath the 10,197-foot peak 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, he
said.
   ``And there were a couple of energetic pulses yesterday evening
and early this morning,'' McGimsey said. Those were strong enough
to have been felt on seismic instruments at Mount Spurr, some 80
miles to the northeast.
   The habitation nearest the volcano, the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles away, had been evacuated before the eruption, the
Alaska Division of Emergency Services said. About 11 people usually
are assigned to the facility.
