<LEADPARA>  ONE of the problems that parents face in trying to provide reinforcement and
enrichment for the lessons their children learn in school is that some of
those lessons deal with facts and theories that simply were not taught just a
few years ago.;    So parents must keep an eye out for ways to refresh their
own knowledge, and I try to make Family Learning a part of that process
whenever possible by sketching out a useful area of study and then providing
information about low-cost and no-cost learning materials that are appropriate
for use in the home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I am reminded this week of a theory in geology called "plate tectonics"
(tek-TAHN-iks), which was discussed only by scientists just a couple of
decades ago and now is taught in elementary and middle schools across the
country. This theory comes to mind right now because it helps explain an event
that happened just 11 years ago this week -- May 18, 1980 -- the eruption of
the Washington volcano known as Mount St. Helens.;    Historical value;    The
volcanoes we studied in school were consigned, for the most part, to history
classes, and, to be sure, there is a great deal of history to be learned from
them. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius (vuh-SOO-vee-us) in southern Italy in
A.D. 79, for example, caught the people in the nearby city of Pompeii
(pom-PAY) so much by surprise that many died where they stood, and the tons of
ash and rock that covered the city preserved it for nearly 1,700 years, giving
us our most accurate information about Roman life of that time.;    And this
Roman foundation to our knowledge of volcanoes was particularly important
because there are so many things that are associated with volcanoes that have
a Roman origin or connection. The word "volcano" itself derives from the Roman
god Vulcan, who was the blacksmith for the gods and who labored at his forge
deep inside a fiery mountain. The word "eruption" comes from the Latin word
meaning "to break out or explode," and "crater" is the Latin word for "bowl.";
   Lessons for today;    We didn't think of volcanoes and earthquakes as being
part of our time in history or our place on the planet. The Earth to us was
truly solid ground, or in the Latin phrase "terra firma." But today our
children are learning that that ground is anything but solid, and that
volcanoes and earthquakes are just the most violent outcomes of the slow,
constant and measurable drift of the Earth beneath our feet.;    The theory of
plate tectonics says that the surface of the Earth, its 50-mile-thick crust,
is broken into several large, shifting slabs. Some of these slabs or plates
bump into each other, some pull away from each other, and some slide by each
other.;    It is at the edges or boundaries of these plates, then, that molten
rock from deep inside the Earth can find its way to the surface. The Earth is
constantly reconstructing itself, and that is why the word "tectonics"
applies. It pertains to "building or construction" and is derived from the
Greek word for "carpenter.";    Map available;    The best visual display of
plate tectonics I have seen is a large (58- by 41-inch) map of the Earth that
plots all the major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have occurred
throughout history. These marks on the map occur all along the various plate
boundaries and form a stunning outline of the pieces in the Earth's fractured
crust. The map, titled "This Dynamic Planet," costs $3 (plus $1 for handling)
and is ideal for a classroom or bedroom wall.;    Send a check or money order
to U.S. Geological Survey, Box 25286, Federal Center Building 41, Denver
80225. I suggest you request the rolled (rather than folded) version of the
map. There is also a free, 45-page pamphlet that the USGS has produced
explaining volcanoes and plate tectonics, which can be obtained by calling
1-(800) USA-MAPS and asking for the pamphlet titled "Volcanoes."  </TEXT>
