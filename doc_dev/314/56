   A series of underwater volcanoes has begun
rising from the sea floor off the coast of Oregon, researchers said
Sunday.
   The volcanoes have appeared during the past 10 years, forming a
line about 300 miles off the coast, according to Dr. Robert Embley
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory.
   Several of the volcanoes are more than 100 feet high and a
half-mile wide, according to Embly and researchers from Oregon
State University.
   Embley said the appearance of the underwater volcanoes may be
related to gigantic bursts of hot, mineral-rich water discovered in
the same area in 1986 and 1987 during research on the sea floor.
   This is the first time scientists have been able to determine
the date of particular ocean floor volcanoes, according to Embley.
Monitoring the development may allow them to learn more about how
such events affect ocean chemistry and temperature.
   The cones were discovered when sea floor pictures and surveys
made during the last year were compared with 1981 surveys and
several new volcanoes were found. Researchers then dove into the
area in the submersible Alvin and found that fresh lava flows
extend into and cover a large fracture that had cracked the older
sea floor.
   The researchers believe that the sea floor in the area is
actively spreading, producing increased volcanic activity.
   This region is part of the so-called Ring of Fire, a system of
volcanic and earthquake-prone regions than encircle the Pacific
Ocean, caused by movement of the giant plates that make up the
surface of the Earth. It is here that the Pacific Plate is grinding
against the North American plate, the same activity that helps
provoke earthquakes in California and Alaska and volcanic eruptions
such as that of Mount St. Helens.
   While the development of volcanoes under the ocean is not
thought to be unusual, scientists do not really know how often such
eruptions occur because of limited ability to monitor their
development.
