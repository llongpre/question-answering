   A strong eruption of Redoubt Volcano
this morning blew abrasive ash more than six miles into the sky and
across the Cook Inlet toward the port town of Homer.
   State Seismologist John Davies said the latest eruption began at
4:03 a.m.
   ``We've got reports from the Drift River (oil) Terminal that
there's a lot of lightning around the mountain,'' Davies said.
``They're packing up to evacuate.
   ``We also got reports from troopers in Homer that they can see
the ash clouds ... that the winds appear to be taking the steam and
ash plume in that direction.''
   The mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel and mail in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays because the airborne ash particles
can damage or shut down aircraft engines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration immediately issued new
flight restrictions today, warning aircraft to remain at least 20
miles from the mountain.
   An airline pilot en route to Anchorage reported an ash cloud
ranging from 31,000- to 33,000 feet today, Davies said.
   ``Winds at that flight level were about 91 knots (105 mph), and
they were blowing from the northwest,'' Davies said.
   ``Seismic signals from the mountain during the initial moments
of the eruption were as strong as any we've received since the
mountain became active several months ago,'' Davies said.
   The mountain began generating more earthquake activity a couple
of days ago, leading seismologists to believe another eruption was
coming, he said. ``We did expect one, but not this soon.''
   An state trooper dispatcher in Soldotna confirmed that ash was
falling in the Ninilchik area of the Kenai Peninsula. But she said
there were no immediate reports of any ash fall around Soldotna.
   Redoubt Volcano is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   A KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 encountered an ash cloud
from Redoubt on Dec. 15, two days after the mountain began
erupting. The ash clogged all four engines and the aircraft fell
more than two miles before the engines could be restarted.
   It made a successful emergency landing at Anchorage
International Airport, but preliminary estimates of damage to the
three-month-old aircraft were $50 million.
