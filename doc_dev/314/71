   Redoubt Volcano erupted Thursday on the
west side of Cook Inlet, hurling volcanic ash seven miles into the
air and prompting the evacuation of seven oil workers as a
precaution.
   The volcano, which last erupted 23 years ago, is 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   ``We had confirmation from a MarkAir pilot who sighted an ash
plume at 35,000 feet,'' said John Davies, state seismologist. ``As
far as I know, no health advisories have been issued yet. We'll
wait and see how much ash gets into the air.''
   An Air Force pilot flying a jet fighter west of Anchorage when
the eruption occurred shortly after 10 a.m. said ash rose from
15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10 minutes.
   ``We went right over that mountain on our way out to the
(training) area and there was nothing happening,'' said Capt. Steve
Stoddard, an F-15 pilot. He said he flew back over the area within
30 minutes and saw the ash cloud.
   ``As we were heading back, I could see we'd have to fly through
it, so we turned down south and flew around the south side of it,''
Stoddard said.
   Oscar Nelson, a bread-truck driver who was on a highway across
the inlet from the volcano when it erupted, said the ash was ``real
white and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.''
   ``We didn't hear any sound,'' said Nelson. ``We just noticed a
plume starting to rise and thought we should jump out and get some
pictures.''
   Seven of 11 workers at the Drift River oil storage facility, the
nearest habitation some 20 miles from the volcano, were evacuated
as a precaution because of the danger of flooding, said Harold
Mouser, the manager of Cook Inlet Pipeline Co., operator of the
facility.
   ``Our people have seen nothing, they felt nothing,'' he said.
   He said some of the workers were evacuated in a light plane that
had gone to the site for a routine grocery delivery, and the others
were transported in a plane sent because of the eruption. The oil
facility was closed. Mouser said a helicopter was standing by for
possible evacuation of the four employees who remained at the site
as monitors.
   The U.S. Geological Survey had warned pilots Wednesday that
there might be an ``ash hazard'' from the 10,197-foot volcano.
Gritty volcanic ash is abrasive and can damage aircraft engines.
   Davies said seismologists from several state and federal
agencies had been monitoring activity beneath Redoubt Volcano for
nearly a week, and activity increased about midday Wednesday.
   ``We were here all night long,'' he said from his office at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks. ``At 10:13 this morning, there was
an obvious and very dramatic increase in activity. It indicated
magma moving at depth, then increased activity at the summit.''
   Concerns associated with the eruption include potential flash
flooding of the Drift River from melted snow, the agency said. Such
flooding occurred the last time the volcano erupted, in 1966.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said a light dusting
of ash was observed in the Wasilla area, about 40 miles northeast
of Anchorage, shortly after noon Thursday.
   ``You can feel the grit,'' said Jim Sey, operations and planning
chief for the division.
   ``I don't think there's too much to be concerned about on this
particular eruption at this time,'' Sey said. Rather, he said,
concerns involved the possibility of successive eruptions.
   ``It's just sort of a wait-and-see game,'' Sey said.
   There were no immediate reports of ash in Anchorage.
   Redoubt Volcano is within the Lake Clark National Park and
Preserve and has been active at least four times during this
century. Until the last few years, the volcano had an active steam
vent near its summit.
   An apparent steam flume from the flank of the volcano was
visible from Anchorage during clear weather Friday, the USGS said.
