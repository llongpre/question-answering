<LEADPARA>  Hard-pressed Philippine officials stepped up rescue and relief efforts
Wednesday amid growing fears of disastrous mudslides from millions of tons of
rocks and ash that rained down during last weekend's devastating eruption of
Mount Pinatubo.;    Scientists estimate that the massive eruption dropped
volcanic debris more than 1,000 feet thick on parts of the volcano's steep
slopes. Heavy rains drenched the area Wednesday in the beginning of the annual
monsoon season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Mixed with rain, mixed with water, it becomes a liquid concrete river,"
said a Western diplomat who is monitoring the crisis. "That's our chief
concern right now.";    Aerial surveys indicated that the eruption "completely
obliterated" an area up to 7.4 miles from the volcano, with considerable
damage within a 12-mile radius, he said.;    Most of the debris came from a
huge dome of magma that built up on the mountain's summit after it burst into
life June 9 after lying dormant more than 600 years. The dome is now a deep
crater more than a mile wide.;    While still active, the volcano has calmed
steadily since Sunday, and thousands of people have returned to the area.;   
The magnitude of the Mount Pinatubo disaster grew Wednesday as the death toll
rose to 169, with an estimated quarter-million people made homeless.;    The
heavy ash crushed thousands of homes and buildings, collapsed bridges and
roads and buried vast sugar cane and rice fields. Economic losses are believed
to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  </TEXT>
