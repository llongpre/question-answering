<LEADPARA>  Thousands of people fled in terror Saturday after a huge fissure cracked Mount
Pinatubo, and scientists said they expected a catastrophic blast from the
volcano.;    In an awesome display of nature's power, day turned into night by
midafternoon across central Luzon and as far south as Manila as a series of 11
explosions sent a relentless, hard rain of golf-ball-sized pumice, pebbles and
ash pouring down. Thunderclaps and jagged streaks of lightning alternated with
brilliant orange flashes from the eruptions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The last 900 U.S. personnel were evacuated from Clark Air Base, deserting
one of America's oldest and largest overseas bases for the first time since
World War II. Philippine officials warned that looters would be shot.;   
About 15,000 evacuees from Clark have been taking shelter at Subic Bay Naval
Base, and the U.S. Embassy announced that 6,000 to 8,000 Air Force dependents
there would be evacuated to the United States on charter flights over the next
few weeks to relieve overcrowding. Ash in the atmosphere, however, has forced
Manila's airports to close.;    A Navy spokesman said there were no plans to
evacuate Subic. The base lies about 25 miles southwest of Pinatubo, but U.S.
officials say it is protected from volcanic flows by favorable terrain.;   
Still, base spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the base had lost all
electricity and power, and a U.S. dependent and a Filipino were killed Sunday
when roofs collapsed under the weight of almost a foot of ash.;    Also
Sunday, six people died when a church collapsed in Dau, near Clark, and eight
people were killed when a hospital roof fell in Olongapo, near Subic,
officials and reports said.;    34 deaths so far;  These casualties raised to
34 the death toll from a week of volcanic eruptions, a typhoon and
earthquakes.;    Under orders from Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, the
government on Sunday extended the "danger zone" around the volcano from 18 to
25 miles and began evacuating three major cities, but washed-out bridges,
ash-clogged highways and a lack of transport slowed the effort.;    Officials
said they had only 250 buses and trucks to move the more than half million
people living in Angeles, Olongapo and San Fernando.;    But many residents,
either unaware of the evacuation or refusing to wait for help, on Saturday
started piling into cars, pedicabs, and trucks or trudged on foot through
knee-deep ash to escape the rumbling mountain.;    Experts fear total blowup; 
Scientists said a 1.8-mile-long fissure that has opened on Mount Pinatubo's
southern slopes raises the grim possibility that the 4,800-foot volcano may
blow itself apart, blasting deadly debris for miles and triggering massive
avalanches of super-hot gases and rocks far into the surrounding countryside.;
   "We are picturing a worst-case scenario," said Ronaldo Arboleda of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. "The situation is really
dangerous. . . . We are not gods, but, based on our studies, something not
good is about to happen.";    "It can go any time, any time now," agreed
Glenda Besana, another government geologist.;    The volcano, which was
dormant for 611 years, became active in April and began minor eruptions last
weekend. Major eruptions started Wednesday and have grown more violent each
day.;    At least 10 small, volcano-related earthquakes rocked the area
Saturday and were felt 60 miles south in Manila, where gray-white ash covered
the capital's streets, cars and rooftops like snow.;    Bizarre wind patterns
heightened the difficulties. Typhoon Yunya, which weakened to a tropical storm
as it swept north of the volcano Saturday, drew low-lying clouds of ash north
and east, while prevailing winds carried higher plumes south and west. The
effect was to dump a blanket of non-toxic silicate ash across most of central
Luzon.;    Half the buildings in the Philippines air force's Basa base
collapsed, officials reported. The ash has also caused incalculable damage to
crops and grazing lands.;    Combined with earthquakes of up to 4.4 on the
Richter scale, the torrents of rain, sand and lumps of pumice made life
miserable for more than 80,000 Filipinos already evacuated from areas near the
volcano and sowed panic in towns bordering the two huge U.S. military bases.
Residents used any means of transport they could find to try to escape the
volcano.;    Onslaught from the skies;  As mud and then a fierce hailstorm of
pumice reeking of sulfur began pelting down Saturday afternoon in Angeles,
tens of thousands of people frantically clambered aboard anything with wheels
and fled on ash-slicked roads in pitch-black darkness.;    Dump trucks and
flatbed trucks carried hundreds of bedraggled refugees, coated brown from the
mud and huddled miserably under tarps and umbrellas. Some hung on hoods and
trunks or clung desperately to the sides of vehicles.;    "We must run away,"
said Roger Pineda, whose wife, Rosario, fearfully clutched their 3-month-old
infant under a tarp as a rain of gravel clattered down. "The volcano is
coming.";    Others rode bicycles, motorcycles, buffalo carts and other
vehicles in what quickly became a nightmarish traffic jam on the two-lane
MacArthur Highway heading south. Trees cracked and fell on all sides from the
weight of the volcanic debris, halting bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours at a
time. The road repeatedly shook from earthquakes, and lightning and eruptions
eerily lit the sky in a hellish display.;    'Like the end of the world'; 
"It's like the end of the world," said Van Punzalan, a 34-year-old farmer who
drove his wife and two children on a tarp-covered motorcycle and sidecar.;   
Nearby, mud-covered and barefoot Arno Lusung, 21, drove his motorcycle behind
a truck carrying his wife and children.;    "I forgot my shoes," he said. "We
just ran."  </TEXT>
