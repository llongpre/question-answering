   Scores of small earthquakes shook Mount
Etna on Monday, threatening to open a new fissure on Europe's most
active volcano, scientists said.
   The volcano has been erupting since Sept. 11, coughing plumes of
ash and lighting the night sky with spectacular fountains of lava
down its southeastern flank. Officials say it poses no threat to
nearby villages.
   Since Sunday night, there have been 30 to 35 temblors an hour on
the volcano, scientists said. The quakes cracked pavement and
forced the closure of a road used to reach sites on the
southeastern side of the mountain.
   Some of the quakes had a magnitude of more than 2 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Giovanni Fazzetta, one of the
scientists monitoring the eruption.
   A quake of magnitude 2 on the scale, which gauges the energy
released by an earthquake as measured by a seismograph, is the
smallest normally felt by humans.
   The increase in quakes could open a new lava-spilling fissure on
the southern flank of Mount Etna, Fazzetta said.
