<DESCRIPT>  JAPAN; VOLCANO; DISASTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mount Unzen spewed superheated rock, gas and ash today, and a nearby volcano
also erupted, prompting officials to warn residents accustomed to that
mountain's constant rumblings.;    Today's flow from Unzen, which sent
volcanic debris 2 1/2 miles down the mountainside and a huge gray cloud
billowing into the sky, broke a lull in activity of several days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There were no reports of injuries or damage.;    Children donned helmets
and held handkerchiefs over their faces as ash dusted the area. In what has
become a common ritual, citizens hosed down the streets and threw buckets of
water on their ash-covered cars.;    Also today, the death of a local
volunteer firefighter brought to 40 the number of lives claimed in the
volcano's eruption earlier this month.;    Toru Sato, a 24-year-old
firefighter who was being treated for severe burns suffered in the volcano's
sudden June 3 eruption, died of multiple organ failure at a hospital in nearby
Nagasaki this morning, police said.;    A fiery avalanche of gas, rocks and
ash gushed down Unzen's east face in that initial eruption, killing those in
its path and razing houses on the outskirts of Shimabara, a city of 45,000 at
the volcano's base.;    Several similar volcanic flows have occurred since,
including the large-scale flow this afternoon, but there had been no further
deaths or injuries because of evacuations from danger areas.;    In all, 2,094
people are being sheltered at schools and gymnasiums. Thousands more have
moved out of town.;    Officials said today they plan to send a passenger ship
to Shimabara port next week to serve as temporary lodging and help ease
crowding at evacuation centers. The Utopia can accommodate 390 people.;   
Officials watching nearby Mount Sakurajima, meanwhile, said its volcano has
been shaken by several small eruptions and hundreds of tremors over the past
few days. Volcanic debris shot out of the volcano in one of its eruptions
Tuesday, and a 1.2 mile-high plume was also seen.;    There were no reports of
injury or damage.;    Residents near Sakurajima, which in recent years has
been one of Japan's most active volcanoes, are accustomed to its rumblings and
an almost year-round sprinkling of ash.;    But activity at the 3,664-foot
Sakurajima increased enough to prompt the Central Meteorological Agency early
today to issue a warning for nearby residents to be careful. Sakurajima has
been shaken by several small eruptions and hundreds of tremors over the past
few days.;    Both Unzen and Sakurajima are located on the southern island of
Kyushu about 75 miles apart.;    An official at the Kagoshima Meteorological
Station said the increased activity at Sakurajima was not believed related to
Unzen's eruptions.  </TEXT>
