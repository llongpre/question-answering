<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Scientists warned people living near Mount Pinatubo to be alert today for
landslides as rain pounded the ash-covered slopes. The 4,795-foot volcano
spewed ash and steam up to six miles high.;    Officials said the death toll
from nearly three weeks of eruptions rose to 338 as the latest casualty
reports reached Manila.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LANDSLIDE WARNING SOUNDED NEAR VOLCANO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a broadcast today over the nationwide Emergency Broadcast Network,
Ronaldo Arboleda of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology
warned that rains have increased the possibility of a deadly lahar -- a huge
mass of mud, boulders and debris -- plunging down the slopes of the volcano.; 
  He said people should be prepared to move quickly away from rivers and
ravines.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the institute, said satellite
photographs showed a new lava dome was forming in the crater, building up
pressure for a possible major eruption.;    He said, however, he did not
expect an eruption on the scale of the one on June 14-15, which sent ash
drifting as far as Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore.;    Meanwhile, the
Philippine foreign secretary said today that if Washington decides to keep
volcano-damaged Subic Bay naval base and Clark Air Base it may have to pay
even more for them because "we suffered more than the Americans did.";    The
lease covering Clark and Subic expires Sept. 16, and renewal talks had bogged
down prior to the eruptions over money and the length of the lease.  </TEXT>
