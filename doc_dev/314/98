   Redoubt Volcano roared back to life
with two eruptions inside an hour that sent a gray sooty column
more than seven miles into the sky and dropped ash for the first
time on Anchorage.
   The volcano settled down late Wednesday and remained quiet this
morning, but tremors beneath the mountain led scientists to believe
it may erupt again soon.
   The volcano, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, painted clouds a
dark gray over Alaska's largest city, then dusted the snow-covered
city of 173,000 with abrasive ash. Another snowfall this morning
largely covered the ash.
   An Anchorage hospital handed out several hundred free masks to
people complaining of respiratory problems, and some pedestrians
wore scarves over their faces. Some flights in and out of Anchorage
were disrupted.
   A moderate eruption was registered shortly before 9 a.m. AST,
and a much stronger blast at 9:47 a.m. sent a plume 37,000 feet
into the air about an hour later, said Tom Miller of the Alaska
Volcano Observatory.
   ``It's been quiet since the last explosion,'' said John Ewert,
another spokesman from the observatory.
   He added: ``There has been a lot of earthquake activity over the
last several days. As long as this activity continues, we see an
increased level of concern for explosive activity in the near
future.''
   The 10,197-foot peak sprang back to life in mid-December after
being quiet for more than two decades and has erupted
intermittently since.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, expressing concern that
jurors wouldn't be able to get home because of limited driving
visibility, recessed the criminal trial of Exxon Valdez skipper
Joseph Hazelwood two hours early.
   At Elmendorf Air Force base, just north of Anchorage, aircraft
were put in hangars. ``A big cloud moved over. Nothing fell out of
it. After it passed, ash started falling,'' said Sgt. Dave
Haulbrook, a base spokesman.
   A number of Delta, United and SAS flights were delayed or
diverted from Anchorage International Airport, which remained open,
said Marsha Sampson, a spokeswoman.
   Anchorage Police were issued masks and air filters for their
patrol cars.
   ``That's just for those whose cars suddenly need a filter
change, and for anyone having to work outside,'' said police
spokesman Walt Monegan.
   The Drift River Oil Terminal was evacuated as a precaution, said
Dave McDowell of the state Division of Emergency Services in nearby
Wasilla.
   Most of the oil was drained after earlier Redoubt eruptions
because of concern that flooding in the adjacent Drift River could
damage the tanks and send oil into the fish-rich Cook Inlet.
   Miller said scientists' ability to predict the mountain's
activity remains limited because of equipment damage from an
eruption last week.
   ``We still don't have our summit station,'' he said.
