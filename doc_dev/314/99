<LEADPARA>  A series of moderate earthquakes jolted areas near Mount Pinatubo today,
sending thousands of people scurrying from their homes and raising fears of
landslides on the volcano's slopes.;    At least five tremors strong enough to
rouse sleepers and topple household objects were recorded among more than 100
since early Monday. There were no immediate reports of damage.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NEW FEARS ERUPT AFTER EARTHQUAKES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Scientists fear avalanches from the tons of debris piled up on the slopes
of the 4,765-foot volcano, which began erupting June 9 after more than 600
years of dormancy. In some ravines, the ash is up to 600 feet deep. A cloud of
ash and steam rose more than six miles high today and rained debris over the
provinces of Tarlac and Pampanga.;    (A Menlo Park geologist said Monday he
agonized over predicting the eruption. See story, Page 10A.)  </TEXT>
