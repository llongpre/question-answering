   Mount St. Helens trembled after its
biggest outburst in four years, and Alaska's Redoubt Volcano shot
steam and ash in its largest eruption since it reawakened a month
ago, forcing schools to close today.
   Despite Mount St. Helens' eruption and renewed earthquake
activity, scientists said they do not believe the volcano is
entering a more explosive phase.
   Seismic levels rose Monday at the Washington volcano for
unexplained reasons, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University
of Washington Geophysics Center.
   Foul weather kept scientists from flying into the crater by
helicopter to take measurements, gather ash samples and replace
monitoring equipment lost in the volcano's ash burst Saturday.
   Ash collected Sunday was examined under a microscope and found
to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions from the 8,366-foot
peak rather than freshly erupted matter, said Dan Dzurisin, aciting
scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Saturday's burst, which was not preceded by earthquakes, sent
ash 90 miles to the east and destroyed two seismometers and two
tilt meters in the crater.
   Jonientz-Trisler said earthquake signals Saturday indicated the
outburst might have resulted from groundwater reaching superheated
rock beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released
by cooling molten rock.
   The quakes Monday, small but sharp and occurring at an
undetermined depth, resemble some that were recorded last August
but were never explained, she said.
   The latest quake pattern does not resemble any that preceded
previous eruptions, she said. ``We're not especially alarmed,'' she
said.
   The latest eruption was the largest since a series of small
explosions in 1986. On May 18, 1980, a cataclysmic explosion from
the volcano leveled 230 square miles, killed 57 people and sent up
an ash cloud that circled the globe.
   In Alaska on Monday, Redoubt Volcano hurled a plume of steam and
ash almost eight miles into the air before activity subsided in the
afternoon.
   Scientists said the patterns preceding the eruption were very
different from previous blasts from the volcano 115 miles southwest
of Anchorage.
   Most of the ash was carried over the Kenai Peninsula and out
over the Gulf of Alaska. Flights from Anchorage to Kenai and Homer
were canceled immediately. Other flights were canceled as darkness
fell and the ash cloud spread over the gulf.
   The ash plume missed for the most part the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer. But the grit was
sufficiently heavy for officials to close schools today in Kenai,
Soldotna, Nikiski and Sterling.
   Officials said they were concerned about the effect the ash
might have on ventilation systems and didn't want students tracking
ash into the buildings.
   The fishing community of Kasilof south of Kenai was coated with
a quarter-inch of ash. Don Rivers, owner of a Kasilof grocery, said
it was the heaviest ashfall there since the 10,197-foot peak sprang
back to life Dec. 13.
   ``People are pretty much just holing up,'' said Rivers. ``People
are starting to get used to it.''
