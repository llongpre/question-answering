FT  07 OCT 92 / Old fears erupt along Japanese fault lines: Last year's
volcano victims are still suffering

SEVENTY-year-old Mrs Shizue Kanegae's home escaped destruction when Mount
Unzen erupted last year. The bad news is that her house will have to come
down when a dam is built to halt the mudslides from the volcano on Kyushu
island, off southern Japan.
'Life will not be the same again,' sighs Mrs Kanegae, a farmer, and one of
the 6,054 people who are now living in one-room prefabricated huts provided
by the local government.
Unzen's explosion evoked one of the deepest fears of Japanese, who live in
fear of earthquakes and volcanoes since the country lies on a fault line in
the earth's crust. The death of 43 people and the destruction of rice
fields, homes, and schools by the lava and hot ash perpetuated feelings of
vulnerability.
Some 15,000 were killed the last time Mount Unzen erupted in 1792. The
volcano is still active, spewing out lava at least once a day. Lava domes
are still growing, although specialists believe that large scale eruptions
are unlikely for the time being.
'It will take more than 10 years for everything to return to normal again,'
says Mr Kanichi Kanegae, mayor of Shimabara City, which lies at the foot of
Mount Unzen.
'However, we're dealing with nature and there are limits to what we can do.'
The eruption, which caused estimated damage of Y124bn (Dollars 1.03bn), has
brought the local economies of Shimabara and its neighbouring town of Fukae
to a halt. The designation of the populated areas as danger warning zones,
prohibiting public entry, has hurt the area's tobacco farming, sewing
factories, and tourism.
In the danger zones, houses are deserted and overgrown grass and weeds cover
the unkept gardens. Tattered decorations from the New Year flutter from an
empty farmhouse rooftop. Bulldozers and trucks raise dust storms, as they
clear away the debris left by the most recent mudslides.
To the frustration of the evacuees and others affected by the volcanic
eruption, the government does not provide direct financial aid to
individuals.
So far, calls from the residents for a special law to aid restructuring have
been rejected. However, donations totalling Y16.1bn have supported the
evacuees, as the disaster has evoked sympathy in the Japanese people.
While office workers who commute to the neighbouring cities were quick to
return to their jobs, unemployment for farmers who have lost their fields
has presented problems.
Trying to find new jobs for those in the agricultural industry is proving to
be the most difficult task for the local authorities. 'It's hard to convince
farmers, who have a strong affinity to their land, to move and change the
way of living at the same time,' explains an official of the Nagasaki
prefectural government.
Local authorities are intent on easing restrictions limiting entry into the
danger zones and the construction of a dam preventing the spreading of
future mudslides. Some 300 homes are planned to be removed to make way for
the construction of 120 protective dams and embankments.
Mrs Kanegae says her son, who has been working on a construction site in
Osaka since the eruption, will no longer have a house to come back to. 'I
can't sleep at night when I think of the mountain and our future,' she says.
