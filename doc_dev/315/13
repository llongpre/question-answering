   A fog-cloaked Mount St. Helens slumbered
through the 10th anniversary of its devastating eruption Friday but
scientists warned that it could awaken with a vengeance.
   The southwest Washington volcano killed 57 people and turned
verdant forests into an eerie lunar-style landscape in its May 18,
1980, eruption. And there is a ``high probability'' of another
major blast within the next 50 or 60 years, said geologist Dwight
Crandell.
   That eruption could have six times the force of the 1980 blast,
which had the power of a 24-megaton nuclear warhead or 2,500
Hiroshima bombs, he said. Crandell, now retired, co-wrote a 1978
government report that predicted the 1980 eruption.
   St. Helens is the peak in the Cascade mountains most likely to
erupt soon, but other volcanoes in the range should be watched
closely, said Tom Pierson, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver. The Cascades run
from northern California to southern British Columbia.
   Pierson said Mount Baker and Mount Rainier in Washington State,
Oregon's Mount Hood and California's Mount Shasta show some signs
of activity, such as minor steam eruptions and bulging. He termed
Rainier ``perhaps the most dangerous volcano in the Cascades''
because of its potential for destruction of a huge area of Puget
Sound lowland.
   None of the scientists said how far in the future such eruptions
might be.
   The volcano experts and government officials headlined a ``Ten
Years Later'' conference that attracted 250 scientists from across
the country.
   The 1980 eruption must serve as a warning to prepare for
inevitable volcanic disasters ahead, the scientists said.
   Better monitoring and early warning techniques must be
developed, smarter land use planning adopted and citizens must stop
building in the likely path of mudflows and flooding that eruptions
will generate, the experts said.
   Pierson noted the 21,000 deaths when a Colombian village was
wiped out by a volcano a few years ago and said population centers
are flourishing in the likely paths of flooding and mudflows from
American volcanoes.
   St. Helens is quiet now but scientists don't know how long the
calm will last, Crandell said.
   The mountain is being monitored in an unprecedented degree and
``almost certainly there will be a warning'' before another major
eruption, Crandell said.
   ``We are learning things that can be applied elsewhere,'' such
as the precursor earthquakes and bulging of the volcano flanks, he
said.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanoes were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting but something that happened somewhere
else,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano hazards for the
USGS.
   Wildlife biologists, foresters and other experts told the
conference the habitat, wildlife and vegetation around St. Helens
have rebounded in a stunning fashion. Virtually every species
devastated by the eruption has come back, they said.
   A helicopter tour of the area dramatized both the destruction
and the recovery. Though snow, rain and sleet obscured the peak
itself Friday, other signs of the eruption were evident _ barren
hillsides still caked knee-deep with gray-brown ash, giant trees
strewn like matchsticks, new river beds riding atop broad mudflow
plains and newly configured lakes.
   The swath of destruction cut by the flow of volcanic material
and shock waves traveling the speed of sound contrasts with the
lush stands of timber that survived.
   But renewal is obvious too. Herds of elk graze on vegetation on
steep slopes near the mountain and trees replanted in the volcanic
ash are growing sturdily, some of them already 30 feet tall. Rivers
and lakes boast good fish runs. A new highway is being punched
through spectacular terrain. Hiking trails abound.
