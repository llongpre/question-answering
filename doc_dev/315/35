<LEADPARA>  THE ERUPTION of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is likely to rank among the
six biggest volcanic eruptions of this century, the U.S. Geological Survey
said Monday.;    Survey officials said it probably would reach 5 or 6 on the
Volcano Explosivity Index, which ranks eruptions by how much pumice and ash
they produce, among other things. The highest possible rating is 10.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In contrast, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington was barely
a 5, said Dallas Peck, a volcanologist and director of USGS.;    Only two
volcanic eruptions this century have reached 6: Novarupta in Alaska, in 1911,
and Santa Maria Volcano in Guatemala, in 1902. Three others were rated 5:
Bezimianny in the Soviet Union, 1956; Cerro Azul in Chile, 1932; and Ksudach
in the USSR, 1907.;    At the height of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, a team of
USGS and Filipino scientists was forced to abandon its monitoring site at
Clark Air Base for a safer position 36 miles from the volcano, Peck said.
Researchers also lost radio contact with their instruments on the mountain,
which monitor earthquakes and changes in the shape of the ground.;    However,
the team returned to Clark Monday morning and was beginning to assess the
extent of mud and ash flows.;    Ash and rock now blanket an area 90 miles
around Pinatubo; at some points, debris flows near the volcano are many yards
thick, the survey said. And while clouds and debris have hampered
observations, it appears that the summit of the mountain is now gone, replaced
by a crater 1.2 miles in diameter.  </TEXT>
