   A cancellation marking and envelope
bearing the likenesses of Mount St. Helens and Harry Truman will be
Ivydale's tribute to the native son who died in the volcano's
eruption a decade ago.
   The 84-year-old Truman was the only resident who refused to
leave the slopes of the mountain in Washington state before it blew
its top May 18, 1980.
   Ivydale postmaster Mary Lou Douglas came up with the idea of
honoring Truman, who was born here in 1896 and moved to Washington
with his parents in 1908.
   The envelope pictures Mount St. Helens spewing a plume of smoke
that outlines Truman's profile. The cancellation carries the
volcano's likeness.
   Julie Perdue, a sophomore at Clay County High School, did the
artwork. Perdue was only five when Mount St. Helens erupted, but
she remembers news coverage of Truman.
   ``That guy got killed because he wouldn't get off. He was quite
a character,'' she said. ``He sure cussed a lot.''
