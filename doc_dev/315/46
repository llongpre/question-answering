   Tom Kadlec had just left church May 18,
1980 when the black clouds began rolling in. He doesn't remember if
the pastor preached fire and brimstone that Sunday morning. If he
did, it was fitting.
   ``About 3:30 in the afternoon it turned blackest dark, and the
automatic street lights came on like the world was coming to an
end,'' Kadlec said. ``We were all wondering what was happening.''
   What happened was something residents of this farming town of
1,800 never want to experience again. Mount St. Helens, roughly 200
miles to the southwest, blew its top at 8:32 a.m. Within hours,
tons of wind-carried volcanic ash and dust were being dumped on the
eastern Washington towns of Ellensburg, Yakima, Moses Lake and
Ritzville.
   ``I didn't hear any explosions or anything,'' recalled Terry
Reed, owner of the 21-room Empire Motel. ``A little later on in the
afternoon, people started coming in and saying, `We want to get in
here and get a room before it hits.' And I said, `What hits?' Well,
I found out.''
   Overnight, Ritzville's population more than doubled. The five
motels in town filled up within hours as roughly 2,200 stranded
travelers abandoned their ash-clogged cars on roads and highways.
Homes, schools and churches served as emergency shelters. The mail
stopped, businesses closed and the city's vibrantly blooming
hawthorn trees sagged and died.
   By Monday morning, 4 to 7 inches of pale gray ash blanketed Main
Street, family wheat fields, the golf course. Drug stores had a run
on dust masks. Grocery stores and restaurants ran out of supplies
and food.
   ``It got so bad the mayor had to close the bars down, people got
to fighting and stealing from one another,'' Reed said.
   For three days, nobody could get into town, or out.
   ``All this ash was everywhere, and it was just quiet. There
wasn't a bird or anything, no sounds at all. It was just eerie,
eerie,'' said Diane Keetch, co-owner of Colwell Motor Inn.
   Kirk Danekas, a funeral home operator who was mayor at the time,
postponed a funeral scheduled for Monday. He trudged up a hill by
the cemetery and looked forlornly down on the heart of the city he
had governed for less than a year and a half.
   ``And there was this great gray mass. And I asked myself, are
all these people going to leave? Is this the end of the town?''
   It wasn't, of course. Nearer the volcano, 57 people were killed,
many by the scorching blast of the eruption or the smothering ash.
But few serious health problems or emergencies were reported here.
   More than anything, the tons of ash were an enormous mess.
   In the weeks that followed, the town dug out. Danekas said 36 of
39 counties sent equipment or other aid. Homeowners cleaned their
roofs and yards and piled the ash along the street. Water trucks
hosed it down. Earth moving machinery pushed it into piles.
Scoop-loaders picked up hundreds of cubic yards of ash and dumped
it in a gravel pit a quarter mile from town.
   ``It was just hard work for everybody,'' Danekas said.
   The abrasive ash wore out farm machinery but didn't seem to
poison any crops. In fact, many wheat farmers suggested the ash was
the reason for a bumper crop that year.
   ``When it rained, the ash seemed to seal the moisture,'' said
Mike Bauer, adding that his crop was 20 percent above average that
year.
   To this day, the ash remains in Bauer's soil, compressed in a
quarter-inch layer. A whitish-gray film can also be seen along
roadsides and undisturbed hillsides.
   And reminders of the fallout a decade ago will long rest in the
hearts and minds of people like Janet Sanger of neighboring Lind, a
town that beckons visitors with a sign that says: ``Drop in. Mount
St. Helens did.''
   ``It was amazing,'' she said. ``I hope I never live through
anything like that again.''
