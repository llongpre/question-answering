Part of the summit lava dome on Redoubt Volcano collapsed, sending up a plume 
of ash and unleashing a rockslide down a flank of the mountain near two 
scientists, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said. There was no telltale seismic 
increase before the lava dome collapsed and the mountain ejected a plume of ash 
and steam that reached 31,000 feet.

Small, shallow earthquakes, which have been occurring at Redoubt since it came 
to life Dec. 14, 1989, usually increase in magnitude and frequency before an 
eruption as a warning signal. The 10,197-foot mountain 110 miles southwest of 
Anchorage sent the rockslide roaring down from the summit crater on the north 
flank of the mountain to about 1,000 feet short of where the U.S. Geological 
Survey scientists were working. They were unharmed, officials said. Redoubt has 
been erupting roughly once a week for several months.
