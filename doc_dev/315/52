flow was to be looked at today by scientists using a helicopter.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Unzen shot up huge new flows of red-hot rocks and superheated gases
Saturday, including an evening outburst that scientists said was bigger than
the one that killed as many as 37 people in southern Japan on Monday.;   
Police reported no casualties by late Saturday, but expanded the evacuation
zone at the foot of the 4,455-foot mountain. Police urged an additional 1,300
residents of Shimabara, a city of 45,000, to leave their homes. The new
evacuations brought to more than 8,500 the number of people who have been
forced to move into temporary shelters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Houses, forests on fire;  The newest eruptions set houses and forests afire
along the Mizunashi River, which has repeatedly carried much of the fiery
outflow down the hill. Thousands of small volcanic rocks rained down on
Shimabara, and fallout from the giant plume thickened the gritty coating of
ash and dust that has built up in the area since the volcano became active in
November after nearly two centuries of dormancy.;    Japanese television
showed lightning bolts piercing the thick plume of hot gray ash and gases,
with towers of flame bursting through seams that extended along the mountain's
ridge top and down its eastern slope.;    Close-up look today;  Scientists
said they hoped to use a helicopter today to get close enough to the volcano
to see whether Saturday's eruptions were triggered by the collapse of a lava
dome that had been building up and clinging to the hilltop's edge more and
more precariously since midweek.;    It was the growth of the lava dome that
prompted evacuation of more than 7,000 people late last week.;    By Saturday
afternoon, before the new eruptions, scientists estimated that 900,000 cubic
meters of the lava dome were perched on the mountaintop, growing by about
100,000 cubic meters a day. Estimates were that about 700,000 cubic meters of
volcanic matter had poured down the hillside since September. The estimate did
not include Saturday's flow.;    The mountain has sent tons of ash and
volcanic gas as high as 300 feet in the air for most of the week.;    Bigger
eruption possible;  Scientists warned Saturday that there was still the
potential for an eruption that could dwarf anything seen so far. They said
existing conditions could lead to collapse of the entire eastern face of the
mountain.;    That could send a plume of ash and superheated gas a mile or
more into the air, unleash a windstorm of air and gases several hundred
degrees hot through Shimabara and greatly expand the area covered by the flow
of red-hot rock and other volcanic matter.;    Such an outburst, they said,
would be preceded by bigger earth tremors, by splits in the earth's surface
and by big changes in underground water levels, any of which should be taken
as the cue for a general evacuation of Shimabara and nearby towns.;   
Saturday's biggest eruption, at 7:51 p.m., was accompanied by about 25 minutes
of earth tremors. The Mount Unzen meteorological observatory said it was the
biggest since the mountain became active in November.;    Mount Unzen's last
previous eruption, in 1792, was Japan's worst recorded volcanic disaster. It
touched off landslides and a tidal wave, killing an estimated 15,000 people.  </TEXT>
