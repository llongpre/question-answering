   Redoubt Volcano hurled a cloud of
volcanic ash into the sky again early today, a day after it roared
into action, and a pilot reported the gritty ash cloud extended 160
miles from the mountain.
   Thursday's eruption, the volcano's first activity in 23 years,
flung ash seven miles high and prompted the evacuation of seven oil
workers.
   Don Richter, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said
Redoubt erupted today from 1:40 a.m. to about 4:30 a.m.
   ``It was powerful,'' Richter said.
   ``A pilot reported an ash cloud extending from Redoubt to
Talkeetna at 3:39,'' he said, adding that there were some reports
of flashing lights that probably were caused by glowing lava.
   Richter said the high-altitude cloud of airborne ash blew past
Anchorage and was falling in less populated areas.
   He said more eruptions were likely. ``I don't like to use the
word `normal,' but a group of eruptions is typical of a volcano,''
he said.
   Thursday's eruption of Redoubt, near the western edge of Cook
Inlet, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, came a day after
scientists detected a significant increase in seismic activity, the
Geological Survey said.
   It ``looked like a little cloud rising over the mountain and it
just started rising like an atomic bomb when it mushrooms,'' said
Kristopher Paull, pilot of an airliner in the area Thursday.
   Ash rose from 15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10
minutes, said Air Force Capt. Steve Stoddard, who was flying an
F-15 jet fighter west of Anchorage.
   Seven of 11 workers at the Drift River oil storage facility were
evacuated as a precaution against flooding from melting snow, said
the manager of Cook Inlet Pipeline Co., operator of the facility.
Such flooding occurred when the volcano last erupted in 1966.
   Manager Harold Mouser said the workers were transported in two
airplanes, one of which was at the site for a routine grocery
delivery. A helicopter stood by for possible evacuation of the four
employees who remained at the site as monitors, he said.
   A truck driver who was on the Sterling Highway, across the inlet
from the volcano, when the eruption occurred said the ash was
``real white and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.''
   John Paskievitch, a geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey,
said seismic activity beneath the volcano returned to normal soon
after the eruption. He said it was impossible to predict whether
more eruptions would occur.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said a light dusting
of ash was observed in the Wasilla area, about 40 miles northeast
of Anchorage, shortly after noon Thursday.
   Redoubt Volcano is within the Lake Clark National Park and
Preserve and has been active at least four times during this
century.
