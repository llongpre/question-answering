A morning trek of Roosevelt elk along a well-tracked slope near Strawberry 
Mountain continues to surprise park visitors. Long-term outlook: a return to 
the forest's pre-eruption state in 150 to 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the volcano's furor, the forest service's initial efforts to open 
Mt. St. Helens to the public were only tentative. Facilities were minimal and 
early entrance was via newly paved or improved surface logging roads. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, major roads have been upgraded to two-way paved routes that can 
accommodate recreational vehicles. 
</P>

The planned 1992 reopening of Spirit Lake Highway to Coldwater Lake, and the 
proposed Johnston Ridge Observation Site -- five miles north of the crater and 
feet from where U.S. Geological Service volcano watcher David Johnston, one of 
several deaths resulting from the volcano, perished -- will mark the 
culmination of a long-term plan for maximizing visitor use of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the monument offers year-round recreation as it did in the past, with 
hiking, fishing, bird watching, spelunking, mountain climbing, snowmobiling, 
cross-country skiing and, of course, volcano watching. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980 eruption, 15,000 climbers a year ascended the back of Mt. St. 
Helens. With the opening of the mountain to climbers in 1987, the mountain has 
once again become one of the most climbed peaks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ape Cave, longest lava tube in the continental United States, allows one to 
take a lantern and probe the underground mystery created by an eruption about 
1,900 years ago. For photography and sketching, the park boasts prized 
vantages. Sites include Lahar, Bear Meadow, Windy Ridge and Strawberry 
Mountain. When complete, Johnston Ridge Observation Site will allow visitors to 
look into the crater. 
</P>
<P>
Private helicopter and small plane tours, operating out of the surrounding 
towns of Cougar, Toutle and Randle, provide elevated looks at the crater, the 
mudflows and blast zone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the trail system has continued to grow. Norway Pass offers one 
of the finest St. Helena views, overlooking Spirit Lake. Cedar Flats, Harmony 
Falls, Lewis River and Boundary trails unravel more of the story, pre- and 
post-eruption, with many other trails offering long distance, overnight hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The nordic trail system south of the mountain, likewise, has expanded with the 
Swift Creek and June Lake trails and with Sasquatch and Toutle trail systems. 
Meadows offer beginners an open playground. Snowmobile routes travel to Marble 
Meadows or follow the lahar (debris flow) to the Plains of Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
Although accommodations still lie outside the park in forest service lands, 
utility and private campgrounds or hotel/motel services are growing more 
frequent in surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one's favorite pursuit, Mt. St. Helens is rising to the call.
