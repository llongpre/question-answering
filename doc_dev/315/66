   Redoubt Volcano rumbled through another
eruption Thursday, ejecting a plume that rose more than five miles
into the sky, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said.
   There was no confirmation of ash in the plume, but it probably
contained some, observatory geologist Steve Brantley said.
   Wind reports indicated any ash carried from the volcano area
would miss Anchorage, Brantley said, and no ash was expected to
reach the Kenai Peninsula, hit by gritty fallout after Redoubt
rocked through an eruption Monday.
   Monday's blowup was the volcano's biggest since it emerged from
a quarter-century of slumber in mid-December.
   Redoubt, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, was cloaked in clouds
Thursday.
   Brantley said scientists had virtually no warning of the
eruption, which occurred at about 2 p.m. ADT.
   ``Since the volcano became active, some of the larger explosive
events have been preceded by a systematic increase in the number of
earthquakes.'' The lack of warning is tied to destruction of
Redoubt's lava dome on Jan. 2, he said.
   ``We don't have the capability of predicting when these events
will occur or how large they will be,'' Brantley said.
   He said scientists are equipped to gauge the strength of
eruptions and transmit information to the Federal Aviation
Administration and other agencies.
   The FAA alerted pilots that volcanic ash was possible in the
Redoubt area Thursday. Ash can shut down jet engines, as it did
last month when a Boeing 747 operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
flew through fallout from Redoubt. The plane lost power to all four
engines and landed in Anchorage after they were restarted.
   Brantley said the volcano also went through a small explosion
Thursday morning. ``After these two events, the volcano seems to be
relatively quiet,'' he said.
