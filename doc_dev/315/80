<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo spewed a deadly cloud of ash and gas more than 15 1/2 miles
high today after a turbulent night in which the volcano shook with the most
intense fury since it awoke from six centuries of sleep.;    "What we are
seeing now are phenomenal eruptions," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of
the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. "The story of Mount
Pinatubo is not quite over yet."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Two deaths reported;  Two deaths have been reported from the eruptions,
which began Sunday.;    A Filipino serving in the U.S. Navy was killed
Wednesday when his car skidded on an ash-slickened road north of the Subic Bay
naval base, 30 miles southwest of the volcano, and crashed into a bus.;    A
member of the Aeta tribe that lives on the slopes of Pinatubo, said he saw his
uncle die in an eruption Wednesday. There was no official confirmation, but
the man himself was badly burned.;    The latest eruption occurred at 8:41
a.m. today and lasted for a half hour. It unleashed giant mudflows down the
jagged, ash-covered western slopes of the 4,795-foot mountain and into the
Marella River.;    The eruption sent a gray avalanche of deadly ash, gases and
molten rock down the slopes. The billowing ash cloud above turned day to
dusk.;    Debris from the eruption covered the roads, and huge boulders, some
the size of cars, littered gullies and riverbeds.;    Ash fell as far as
Olongapo, 25 miles to the southwest.;    Aviation authorities warned airline
pilots to avoid flying near the volcano after a Saudi Airlines 747 developed
engine trouble Wednesday when it passed near the ash cloud en route to Manila
from Dhahran.;    The plane landed safely and an inspection showed volcanic
ash in the engines, according to air controller Roserene Reyes.;    Today's
eruption followed a violent night in which the volcano exploded with a fury,
first at 10:52 p.m., then again a short time later and a third time at 12:04
a.m. today.;    "This is already the big bang," Punongbayan said. "I can't see
any other eruption that will exceed this. What we are seeing now are
phenomenal eruptions.";    Another seismologist with the institute, Delfin
Garcia, said the volcano was entering "an episode of big eruptions" that would
continue indefinitely.;    Wednesday's eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a
tremendous blast that sent forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second
explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;   
After the nighttime eruptions, the troops that remained at nearby Clark Air
Base, from which most personnel were evacuated on Monday, prepared to
evacuate.;    About 100 vehicles lined up near the main gate and restless
troops milled about clutching their duffel bags, but no evacuation order was
issued.;    In the city of Angeles, which is adjacent to Clark, the more than
300,000 residents spent an anguished night, fearful the volcano might force
them to flee. Many residents packed emergency kits with clothes and provisions
and stored them in their cars so they could leave at a moment's notice.;   
Thousands evacuated;  In all, more than 35,000 people have been evacuated from
areas near the volcano since it began showing signs of activity last week.
They include thousands of primitive Aeta tribesmen, who fled Wednesday on
buffaloes and ox-drawn carts after large rocks rained down on them.;    Aetas
who were evacuated to refugee centers in Olongapo appeared to have been upset
by the ordeal. Many spoke of the ground shaking furiously before the huge
volcanic clouds appeared.;    "It's very hard for us when the ground shakes,"
said Vilma David, 32. "Why doesn't it end so we can go home?"  </TEXT>
