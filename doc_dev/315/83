<HEAD>Redoubt Volcano Erupts Again; Sends Out Ash Cloud</HEAD>

   Redoubt Volcano rumbled alive today,
spitting ash and steam at least five miles into the air, scientists
said.
   Redoubt produced a ``vigorous'' eruption at 10:20 a.m., said
Steve Brantley of the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   Pilots reported ash up to at least 26,000 feet, he said. Winds
from the southwest were expected to carry the ash north and
northeast.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage rumbled awake Dec.
13 after a 25-year rest.
   Periodic eruptions since then have disrupted air traffic off and
on, including Saturday. But today's eruption did not immediately
result in new flight restrictions, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   Saturday's activity was ``clearly a minor event'' compared to
eruptions last month and even earlier last week, the observatory
said. Scientists said that during the day the volcano continued to
generate ``a vigorous plume'' of steam and volcanic gas to
altitudes of 12,000 to 15,000 feet.
   Volcanic ash is of concern to pilots because it can shut down
jet engines. A Boeing 747 operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines lost
power to all four engines after flying through Redoubt ash last
month. The engines were restarted and the plane made a safe
emergency landing in Anchorage.
