   Scientists took samples of gritty ash
from the flanks of Mount St. Helens in hopes of learning whether
the volcano's latest burst will bring more explosive activity.
   Three scientists got within 12 miles of the crater on the east
flanks of the 8,366-foot mountain Sunday to gather ash from the
largest explosion in nearly four years.
   Dan Dzurisin, acting scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, said the ash appeared to be pulverized
material from previously erupted lava.
   If an examination by microscope shows the ash is from a new
surge of magma or molten rock beneath the volcano, however, it
could be a sign of more explosions to come, Dzurisin said.
   Scientists also planned to fly in a helicopter over the crater
to determine whether there was an avalanche from the lava dome in
the eruption Saturday morning. Dense clouds prevented a flight
Sunday, Dzurisin said.
   The latest eruption, which came without preceding earthquakes,
sent ash as far as 90 miles to the east and destroyed two
seismometers and two tilt meters in the crater. No injuries were
reported.
   Seismographs and other equipment recorded the two-minute
explosion beginning at 5:37 a.m. Saturday. After a couple of hours
of small earthquakes beneath the volcano, seismic activity subsided
to normal levels, Dzurisin said.
   In the past few months, there have twice been lesser bursts from
the volcano. On Aug. 24, there was a minor eruption with no ashfall
detected. On Dec. 8, ashfall was limited to the crater.
   An eruption like Saturday's, without the small earthquakes in
advance to give a warning, is ``relatively new to us,'' Dzurisin
said.
   It was the most significant explosion since a series of small
explosions spit ash in the spring of 1986, he said.
   U.S. Forest Service and Wapato police officials received dozens
of calls Saturday, reporting light dustings of a fine, gritty,
gray-white ash in and around Yakima in the south-central part of
the state. Yakima is about 80 miles from the volcano.
   The volcano's last significantly large eruption was on March 19,
1982, when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork
of the Toutle River, he said.
   The last dome-building eruption, a more quiet process in which
molten rock pushes upward to swell the huge mound of cooling lava
in the crater, was in 1986.
   Studying the recent ashfall could indicate whether the eruption
was part of a ``last gasp'' or the start of a more explosive phase
in the volcanic activity that began in March 1980, Dzurisin said.
   The cataclysmic explosion of May 18, 1980, leveled 230 square
miles, killed 57 people and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe. It also blew off the top 1,300 feet of the peak.
