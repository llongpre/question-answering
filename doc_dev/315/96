<HEAD>Redoubt Erupts Again; Pattern Set</HEAD>

   A new Redoubt eruption confirmed the
pattern that geologists have observed in the seismic activity
around the volcano over the past four months.
   Increasing tremors at the volcano's base heralded a moderate
blast Friday from the 10,197-foot volcano about 110 miles southwest
of Anchorage, said geologist Michael Doukas.
   The same earthquake pattern preceded moderate eruptions on March
23 and March 29.
   The latest eruption, at 5:23 p.m. ADT (9:23 p.m. EDT), sent ash
30,000 feet into the sky. It lasted eight minutes, according to a
seismometer on Mount Spur, about 30 miles north of Redoubt.
   Previous eruptions have disrupted flights because the ash can
ruin airplane engines. But the ash from Friday's blast was split by
wind sheer and drifted in two directions, Doukas said.
