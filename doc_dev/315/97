<LEADPARA>  BIOLOGISTS and ecologists studying the revegetation of Mount St. Helens have
discovered a case in which nature would probably have been better off if
people had left it alone.;   When the volcano exploded in 1980, nearly every
sprig of vegetation within 15 miles was swept away or buried. In the years
since, from buried seeds, pieces of root and dormant growth buds, native
vegetation is slowly returning -- trees like willow, red alder and hemlock
seedlings and plants like fireweed, thistle and lupine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A new study shows that 83 plant species, of 256 known to have been there
before the eruption, have been identified in the damaged area.;   But alien
plants introduced in an effort to reduce erosion in the immediate aftermath
seem to be inhibiting recovery of the native species, according to findings by
Dr. Virginia H. Dale, a mathematician and ecologist at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee.;   Dale determined that on plots where exotic plants
made up more than 10 percent of the vegetation cover, the native plants and
especially coniferous trees are struggling to gain a foothold.;   But their
survival and growth are threatened by competition from introduced species,
such as the robust cloverlike plant Lotus corniculatus, a legume commonly
known as birdsfoot trefoil.;   "Lotus is reducing the abundance of native
species rather than enhancing the recovery process," Dale concluded in a
report published in the current issue of Research &amp; Exploration, a journal of
the National Geographic Society.;   Dale suggests that the alien grasses
deprived the native species of moisture and scarce nutrients. Also, she said,
the abundance of seeds from the dense alien grass caused the mouse population
to rise sharply, and the mice in turn killed many young conifers by chewing
off their bark.;   "By studying the process of natural revegetation of such
denuded sites and the consequences of human interference, scientists will be
able to improve prescriptions for reclamation of other areas," Dale said in
the report.  </TEXT>
