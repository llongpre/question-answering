<LEADPARA>  A San Jose teacher has found a novel way to keep troubled kids coming to
school. He takes them out of the classroom -- and puts them on bicycles.;   
Avie Katz runs San Jose's only school on wheels, a program he says may be the
only one of its kind in the country. The class is a last stop for teens who
have been kicked out of more traditional schools.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In Katz's summer program, the 14 students spend most of their days on
10-speed bicycles, traveling around the South Bay to visit centers of history,
religion, culture, economics and current events. They spend the rest of their
time in classroom lessons and working on their bicycles.;    "I used to sit
down and not do anything in school," said 16-year-old Osvaldo. "Now I'm
learning about new cultures, visiting museums. It changes your life.";    Katz
says that besides building their minds, the program focuses on building their
strength, stamina and independence by increasing their ability to ride and
maintain their bicycles. The course, which runs from June to mid-August, takes
longer and tougher rides, ending with a 50-mile trip from the Moorpark
Community Center campus on Fruitvale Avenue to Menlo Park for a tour of Sunset
Magazine.;    "It's a catalyst for learning," said Bob Michels, principal of
the community center. "It shows the students that if they set goals, they can
reach them. So many students don't feel they can do certain things. When they
focus in, they can and they do. It does a lot for the kids' self-esteem and
self-image.";    Katz, an avid cyclist and bike builder, began the class nine
years ago as an alternative to a one-hour gym class at another school. With
the help of donations from local bike shops and a $450 equipment budget, he
turned it into a full-time summer program offered through the Santa Clara
County Office of Education.;    Students have visited the Peralta Adobe, San
Jose's Museum of Art and the Triton Art Museum in Santa Clara, a San Jose fire
station, De Anza College's Planetarium and the Mercury News building. They
will study plate techtonics in Los Gatos and visit Bullwinkles to learn how to
make pizza.;    "It's a chance for them to see a side of life they wouldn't
normally see," said Katz.;    Besides the traditional blackboard, their
classroom has a sophisticated bike repair shop where students learn mechanics
on the fleet of aging bikes.;    Katz said that most of the students, who are
in their mid-teens, have had troubles in school that are the result of broken
homes or emotional disabilities. Some were gang members, auto thieves or
chronic fighters before entering the program and many spent time in the
criminal justice system, which often has referred students to the program.;   
"When you have kids with visible disabilities, you know they have a handicap,"
said Michels. "You can't see the handicap with some of these kids, but it's
there.";    On Monday, they visited an 87-year-old Buddhist temple in San
Jose's Japantown, learning from a priest about philosophy, Buddhist symbolism
and racial discrimination.;    An outsider would have trouble distinguishing
the group from any other class. Members were polite, asked intelligent
questions and carefully rode more than four miles each way in a tight line.
When one got a flat tire, the others stopped to help.;    Their stories tell
you this isn't the average class.;    "I stole a car," said 15-year-old
Draden. "I stole your wife's car.";    "I fought with teachers," said
14-year-old Sonna. "I thought I could get away with everything.";    With two
weeks to go, the students said the course has helped them. Some said they want
to go to college someday or find good jobs. Others say they just want to get
through high school.;    Dung, 17, said he couldn't stay in school because of
fighting. Now, however, he is the one to whom the others turn when they need
mechanical help.;    On the ride, he stops often to tighten a seat, patch a
tire or true a wheel. His teachers say he has learned responsibility in the
class. Dung said that before taking the class, he didn't know how to work on a
bike.;    "I hope to go to college after," he said. "Or maybe I'll be a bike
mechanic."  </TEXT>
