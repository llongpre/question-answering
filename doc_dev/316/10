It's not the kind of neighborhood that conjures up images of bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
This section of Pacoima looks like a model for bad zoning laws. Small 
wood-frame houses are mixed in with factories, warehouses and discount auto 
dismantlers. The cement streets are cracked from the weight of big trucks. The 
air has a chemical sting. It's the kind of place bicyclists find themselves 
when the ride has gone bad and they're hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end of the world," John Slawta said, "but you can see it from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
However, it's in this end of the Valley that the 28-year-old Slawta has chosen 
to make some of the most sought-after bike frames in the world. These frames go 
from Pacoima to the Tour de France, to Italy for the Giro d'Italia and to 
Montana for Harrison Ford. These are Landshark bikes -- custom-made and very 
custom painted. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is definitely ugly," Slawta said as he stands in the doorway of the 
850-square-foot industrial space on Montague Street that he rents for $595 a 
month. The low-slung multitenant building could be mistaken for a personal 
storage company. 
</P>
<P>
"You see that power plant over there? I figure how smoggy it is by how much 
detail I can see on it. Today is definitely ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Ugly day or not, Slawta has six bikes to get ready to ship this week. "I keep 
it at six," he said. "It gives me goal and it's a reasonable number to get 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Because he makes and paints the bikes himself, six of the $760 frames -- this 
is just for the frame, serious cyclists add their own wheels, brakes, gears and 
other components -- are more than enough to keep him busy for the week. 
</P>
<P>
He crosses the cement-floored room strewn with the odd, specialized tools of 
the bike-makers trade. On the wall are postcards and letters racers have sent 
him from around the world. A letter written in 1988 on the cheap stationery of 
a hotel in Belgium is from Andy Hampsten, now one of the top American riders. 
It begins, "Thanks for the bitchin' bike" and ends "my season is coming." Later 
that year he won the Giro d'Italia riding one of Slawta's bikes. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of all this casually placed machinery is an $8,500 frame 
fixture, which doesn't look very impressive. It's a holding device that 
precisely aligns the tubing while it is being joined together, but it's so 
basic it could have been designed in the 19th Century. The frame-builder's art 
doesn't rely on high-tech computerized gizmos. It's the work of the seasoned 
craftsman who combines mechanical talents with the right artistic touch. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the quality control over here," Slawta said as he bends the rear part 
of an almost-finished frame, measuring with oddly shaped tools as he goes 
along. "You get them straight -- or straight enough." 
</P>
<P>
Straight enough must satisfy the professional riders and fanatic amateurs who 
are Slawta's clients, including actor Michael Nouri, Olympic volleyball 
superstar Karch Kiraly, ex-Laker Billy Thompson and former San Francisco 49er 
Dwight Clark. Getting the frame aligned perfectly is something they -- and 
Slawta -- take extremely seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Prestige tubing he uses in making the frame is tricky to handle. The center 
parts of the tubes are thinner than the ends, to make it lighter. The ends are 
thicker where the tubes are brazed together (the metal is too heat-sensitive 
for welding). As he tinkers with the rear part of the triangular frame the 
metal seems to have a life of its own. He pushes it, it bounces back. 
</P>
<P>
"These frames have a lot of spring in them," he said. He is surrounded by an 
assortment oddly shaped tools, all of which have some specialized purpose in 
measuring frame alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a frame-builders scale," he said as he attaches the frame to the 
hand-held device. "You know a fisherman's scale makes everything weigh more," 
he said, "this one makes it weigh less." 
</P>
<P>
Joking about frame weight would be heresy to his clients. In the world of 
top-level bikes, less is definitely more. Racers are looking for the tiniest 
edge. In last year's Tour de France, Greg LeMond made a phenomenal comeback on 
the last day, winning by a few seconds. Some credit the victory to a new type 
of handlebars he used that allowed him to lean forward and be more aerodynamic 
as he pedaled. The tradition-bound French had dismissed the bars as just 
another American gadget. 
</P>
<P>
Slawta walks next door to a shop that makes fluorescent lights for the movie 
industry to use their photocopying machine. While he's there he picks up an 
order that's been faxed from Canada. At the rate of 300 bikes a year selling 
for $760 each it's easy to figure that one of these days he's going to be able 
to afford his own fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Placing the fax on the rack on which he's just been straightening frames, he 
mulls over the numbers of the frame geometry -- how long the customers wants 
the top tube, the seat tube, the angle of rake for the front wheel forks. All 
of this is critical in deciding how the bike will ride. 
</P>
<P>
Bikes used for touring are a little more slung out, like a large car with a 
generous chassis. Racing bikes are tighter, stiffer, sometimes even a little 
"twitchy" -- too responsive, like a sports car with a too tight suspension 
system. 
</P>
<P>
There's a strong scent of paint in the shop that's beginning to irritate his 
visitor's throat. When it's brought to his attention Slawta looks up from the 
fax, said he doesn't notice any paint smell, then looks up again. "That's kind 
of scary, isn't it?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Slawta has been around paint so much that he's become oblivious to it. In fact, 
it was painting that originally brought the Landshark much of its fame. Slawta 
once planned to attend Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. He now 
expresses himself artistically with his bike frames. At a time when most bikes 
were in staid, traditional colors, his frames looked like a modern art show on 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to get people to react," Slawta said. "I like people to see the 
bikes and have to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Some frames are done in a pattern of Jackson Pollock-style drips, others evoke 
the bright patterns of surfing clothes. There are amoebas and patterns that 
wouldn't seem out of place on a Amazon Indian's face. 
</P>
<P>
"I like people to look at my paint jobs and not know how I did it, even though 
it only took minutes to make," Slawta said. "It's one of those things that to 
do it right you have to do it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Slawta has spent almost his entire life in the Valley, but by the end of the 
year he plans to move to southern Oregon. He does not know anyone there, he 
said, but he feels the rural atmosphere will be a more creative place to work. 
And since four out of five orders for his frames come from out of state, he's 
not tied to Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss the convenience of living here," he said, looking out the 
door at the power plant. "But if you've a chance to do things better, do it 
now. The meter's running."
