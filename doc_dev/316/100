is expanding thanks to its no-frills philosophy

JUST about a year ago a strange concept arrived in this country from Japan -
a selection of clothes and household products that were almost monastically
simple. They were sold by the 'no brand goods' Muji shop, at 26 Great
Marlborough Street, London W1. Although in Japan Muji had become something
of a cult, with some 221 shops spread throughout the country, in the UK they
were almost unknown.
Based on the notion that there must be a demand for well-made, well-designed
simple clothing and household products, and that it was not always necessary
to have a high-profile label and a glitzy front to appear desirable, the
shops homed in on a kind of sophisticated simplicity that was a refreshing
change from the 'look-at-me' excesses of the 1980s.
In the UK, the first shop, the product of a joint venture between Ryohin
Keikau and Liberty, echoed faithfully the philosophy of the Japanese model.
Austere, rusty (but purposefully so) metal shelves displayed the clothing
made from mainly natural materials and the small range of essential
household products and stationery accessories. Clothes were primarily those
that were meant to be worn and used and not just to adorn. Household
products were functional, often of traditional design.
Now that simplicity and an air of elegant austerity have become fashionable,
it is not surprising to learn that the first shop has prospered. The
matt-black yuppie crowd, which once went in for lots of gleaming steel and
instantly-recognisable labels, took to its ranges as they embraced their
changed status in the 1990s. They went for the stationery and storage boxes
in particular while the Muji T-shirt, dead plain in white or grey, with all
the proportions just so, goes on selling and selling at Pounds 8.95 a go. So
successful has it been that, yesterday, a second, much-enlarged, lighter,
brighter Muji opened in London's Covent Garden at 39 Shelton Street.
The new site - some 2,200 square feet in an old Victorian warehouse - means
the shop will be able to sell some products that are part of the core Muji
range in Japan.
Design aficionados will be interested in the bicycle pictured right - first
shown at the Tokyo Creative Exhibition at Liberty - where the catalogue
described it as 'a bike to hang on your wall as well as to ride.' Designed
by Satoshi Yasui, its chief claim to fame is that it has dispensed with that
source of dirt and aggro, the chain, and substituted a shaft.
It is not the first shaft-driven bicycle but it is still new enough for most
of us to be intrigued and fascinated. The Muji bike certainly looks good -
simple, minimalist, streamlined, practical. It is the sort of bike that
appeals to the designer brigade - it speaks of a love of clean, understated,
unadorned aesthetics. The price of these aesthetics, it has to be made
clear, is dear - the bike costs Pounds 650. There are probably plenty of
people who prefer to broach their bicycle-buying from a more practical
standpoint - like, what is it like to ride? Who better to ask than bicycle
fan Max Wilkinson, Weekend FT editor, who reports on his test-ride in the
accompanying story.
Apart from the bicycle, another new line for the British Muji is furniture.
Now this is not the sort of product for those of you with country houses and
rustic hideaways - these are brushed metal tables and shelf units, metal
trolleys, drawer units and storage boxes, the sort of things you might need
to fit out a workroom or a home office, to put order into a larder or a
studio. The Muji boxes have been one of the great hits of the existing shop
 -in polypropylene, galvanised metal or just plain brown cardboard they are
the basics of many a highly-organised filing system, whether for home or
office. Boxes range from about Pounds 3.50 to Pounds 34 for the very largest
size in acrylic, but there are lots at under Pounds 10.
Also look out for more clothes. Those who have admired traditional Japanese
Mingei workwear - all those loose-wrapped, strong easy shapes in cotton
indigo, seersucker and linen - will now have an authentic selection to
choose from.
These, you will not be surprised to hear, are not clothes for wearing to
Ascot, for wowing them at the Caprice or carrying the day in the boardroom.
Not for nothing do they call them One Mile Wear. The loose-fitting tops and
drawstring pants make comfortable clothes for relaxing in at home, for
wearing in your local neighbourhood, while doing the shopping, or pottering
round or doubling as pyjamas and dressing-gowns.
If that build-up sounds as if they are cheap the answer, I am afraid, is
that they are not. By the time Japanese labour costs, standards of living
and strong yen have been taken into account they emerge on our market as
very expensive indeed, clothes strictly for those, I would say, for whom the
Mingei cult is beguiling enough to make them pay the premium rate.
Sketched below is a set of trousers and jacket made from hand-dyed cotton,
available in medium size only for men or women, Pounds 175. The traditional
kimono is Pounds 100.
