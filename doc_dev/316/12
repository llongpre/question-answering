A BIKER'S PLEA TO MOTORISTS: HELP END THE CYCLE OF DEATH;

TOO MANY RECREATIONAL RIDERS ARE DYING UNDER THE WHEELS OF CARELESS DRIVERS. A

Charles Bright recently died in the heat of the afternoon, not far from his 
home, riding a bicycle at the age of 51. They said he started as a Jungle 
Cruise guide and rose to a top corporate position at Disney. A friend called 
Bright "a dreamer, a doer." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Lundie was 66 when he died. Someone slammed into him and his bike on 
Santa Ana Canyon Road, and whoever it was didn't even bother to stop. Lundie's 
wife said he rode because "he loved it." 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of these men, and others like them, were reported in the pages of 
this newspaper. Men and women, of all ages, out on a bike for fun or exercise, 
enjoying the weather that has drawn us all here, killed in an instant of sheer 
negligence or recklessness or just plain bad luck. The statistics speak for 
themselves: During the past decade, bicycle fatalities in Orange County have 
doubled. Injuries have climbed sharply too. 
</P>
<P>
If you ride bicycles at all, and I do -- four, five times a week -- it's not 
really surprising. People are in a rush, always in a hurry to go somewhere, 
anywhere, and sometimes bikers just get in their way. 
</P>
<P>
Ride your bike sometime and see what I mean. It doesn't take long before you 
get the look: the icy glare of a motorist who resents having to share the road. 
Sometimes they'll flip you the finger, or honk, or if they're bold or reckless 
enough, veer into the bike lane just to give you a little scare. Just to show 
you who's boss. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly it's just the look, one of impatience, of having to slow for a group 
of cyclists. Certainly there are considerate, drivers out there who give bikers 
a little space, who recognize the inherent dangers. But all it takes is one, 
late for work, in a rush to pick up the kids, and we here at the newspaper will 
be writing another obituary -- and updating the grim statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is there is a lot of blame to go around. It's not always the 
motorist at fault. Some bikers run lights like the law doesn't apply to them, 
ride three abreast in the road, ride too fast for traffic, weave in and out of 
traffic, neglect their responsibility to let motorists know their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
These cyclists should know better, and no one can be held at fault if a hot-rod 
biker decides not to stop for the light because it will slow his momentum. 
</P>
<P>
But most serious bikers I know recognize the dangers and wisely ride in a way 
to cut the odds of the unthinkable. We ride 21-pound bicycles with a 6- to 
8-ounce piece of pressed Styrofoam on our heads. We take the risk because we 
love to ride, but we do what we can to reduce the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists ride because we love the sport, the freedom it offers, the sheer fun 
of it, the release from the stress of work. We enjoy the camaraderie of the 
pack, the physical demands. 
</P>
<P>
We ride on the road because that's what the law says we must do. And if we're 
not riding next to the curb, but near the bike-lane stripe, it's because it is 
the safest place to be. A lot of motorists don't seem to understand this. But 
slow down sometime and take a look at the debris littering the bike lane -- 
rocks, broken glass -- not to mention the drainage gates. Ride in the gutter 
and you won't be riding for long. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that many accidents are caused not by the anger of a motorist trying 
to get even, but by negligence, and ignorance. It's easy to misjudge the speed 
of cyclists. Many drivers pass you and then veer into the bike lane to make a 
right turn. By the time they slow for the turn, you're often closing in on 
their rear bumper, and the only way to avoid impact is to slide by on the left 
-- in the lane of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists have a responsibility to watch out for us, to signal us their 
intentions, to let us pass, just as we have a responsibility to make our 
intentions known. Bikers are taught to ride in straight lines, but excuse us if 
we do veer to avoid a broken bottle in the roadway. The typical road bike tire 
is about as wide as your thumb, and even a small rock can send us spilling into 
the road. So if we weave a bit, forgive us. 
</P>
<P>
And we should always use hand signals, make eye contact with drivers and make 
sure it is clear before cutting across lanes to make a left. And motorists must 
grant us equal rights. They shouldn't drive too close when there is room in 
another lane. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is home to thousands of avid recreational cyclists. We have 
families and children and jobs. We just also happen to have bikes. It also is 
home to some of the world's worst traffic. But we're going to have to learn to 
share the road. 
</P>
<P>
If not, we'll be writing more obituaries about people who simply "loved to 
ride."
