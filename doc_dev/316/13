<LEADPARA>  Teacher layoffs. Librarians at school only once a week. No art classes. No
music. An entire school district -- Richmond -- bankrupt. And a governor
wanting to cut another $2 billion.;    Those were the headlines during the
spring and summer as California struggled with the worst budget deficit in its
history.  </LEADPARA>

Because of an editor's error, a story on Page 1A of Sunday's Mercury News
incorrectly reported the status of bus service in the East Side Union High
School District. Regular bus service will be the same as last year. The
district also provides transportation for students in magnet programs and
voluntary transfer students.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Now, as school begins in most places this week, what will greet the kids?; 
  What follows is a sampling of how some larger school districts are coping in
lean times. It provides some answers to help parents negotiate schools that
are trying to stretch their dollars and your children's education.; Q Where
can I find music and art instruction if those classes have been cut?;    A
Shop around. East Side Union, for instance, has music and art programs in
every school; you can transfer if you can't find one you like in your home
school. Talk to your school's assistant principal.;    Art classes were
trimmed in San Jose Unified middle and high schools, but since they weren't in
high demand anyway, the district figures there are enough left to accommodate
interested students. If you still can't find what you want, the San Jose
Museum of Art School's youth classes range from painting and ceramics to
comic-book art and cartooning. Saturday and after-school classes are held at
the museum and 20 schools in the San Jose area. Average cost per course --
including materials -- is $60 for members; $70 for non- members. Call (408)
294-ARTS.;    Things are harder for the musically inclined. In San Jose
Unified, only the performing arts magnets -- Cory and Trace Elementary,
Castillero and Hoover Middle Schools, and Lincoln High School -- are offering
extensive programs in music and art. Students have through the end of
September to transfer. Call (408) 998-6430 or (408) 998-6410.;    Another
alternative is the new Saturday Academy -- which offers art and music classes
Saturday mornings. Information is now being mailed, or you may call (408)
998-6000.;    In Fremont Unified, instrumental music was cut in elementary
schools, while general music classes still will be offered. The district also
is formulating a plan to offer elementary students instrumental music classes
for a fee at Fremont Adult School.;    Newark Unified will offer instrumental
music during teacher- preparation periods. Neither New Haven Unified nor Palo
Alto Unified are cutting any classes.;    In Mountain View School District,
programs have been pared back but not eliminated, with students getting
one-hour-a-week art sessions with instructors from the Community School of
Music and Art.;    Q If the school library is unattended, where can my child
get research help?;    A Librarians dodged the bullet as almost all districts
will have a "learning resource specialist" around at least part- time.
Mountain View, for instance, kept its librarians by trimming their work day
from four to three hours and awarding certificates to students who frequent
the public library.;    If you're still concerned -- volunteer. District
officials say there's plenty of need for parent volunteers.;    Q If they've
cut counselors, how do I find out what classes my kid needs to get into
college?;    A Most high schools have career centers staffed at least
part-time. And there's plenty of printed material -- just ask.;    Fremont
Unified had threatened to cut all 34 of its counselors but cut none. Palo Alto
actually added one high school counselor and two middle school counselors.;   
Q But if some electives and advanced classes are being eliminated, are there
enough left to make my kid eligible for a good college?;    A In San Jose
Unified, students are free to transfer to another school if they want specific
classes -- provided there's room. All high schools will offer advanced
placement (AP). The GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) program will be in a
different format -- the district is still ironing out details, and the program
will not begin until October. Parents can contact their school for information
on either.;    The district is also offering two advanced classes -- geometry
and advanced calculus -- by live television.;    In East Side, classes will be
cut or eliminated if not enough students sign up, affecting advanced classes
in some smaller schools. But students are free to transfer within the district
if their home school does not offer specific classes.;    In Fremont, Newark
and New Haven, none of the advanced placement or basic classes required for
graduation was cut; Newark sliced administrative and clerical staff instead.; 
  In Mountain View, classes are intact though they may be larger, and the GATE
budget was trimmed only for materials.;    Q Who will teach my child how to
drive now that most behind- the-wheel training classes have been cut?;    A
For most, that job is now up to parents, although driver's education -- which
prepares students for the written test -- is still being offered.;    New
Haven and Fremont Unified still provide behind-the-wheel training, but for a
fee. At New Haven, it costs $100 for the course. Fremont Unified provides the
class through the adult school. The fee is still to be set. Driver training in
Palo Alto is available through the adult school for $145.;    Other than that,
schools advise you to let your fingers do the walking.;    Q What should I do
if there are not enough books or supplies to go around?;    A Districts are
more than happy to accept donations: binder paper, glue sticks, note paper,
etc. Businesses are welcome to contribute old letterhead stationery and other
paper that can be reused, and old computer disks -- and they can write off the
donation.;    But no one is expecting supply shortfalls. Cuts were made
elsewhere.;    Q What can I do to help my child's teacher deal with large
class sizes?;    A Volunteer -- especially if your child is in elementary
school. Contact your child's teacher for information. For middle or high
school level, contact school administrators.;    Q Are there going to be
enough teachers?;    A Despite all the layoff notices, fewer than 50 regular
teachers are still looking for work in those districts where a total of more
than 500 jobs appeared to be on the line last March. But thanks to
retirements, leaves and resignations, there will still be significantly fewer
teachers overall in schools -- 50 fewer in San Jose Unified alone -- and kids
will return to schools with larger classes and fewer elective courses.;    Q
Will there be a yellow bus to wait for?;    A San Jose Unified has reduced
transportation for athletic teams, but all court-ordered busing for
desegregation remains. In East Side, students participating in magnet programs
and voluntary transfer students will continue to be bused, but no one else
will.;    Berryessa Union has axed its buses; only special education students
get to ride. In Fremont, busing remains -- for a $200 fee -- and fewer are
eligible: elementary students if they live one mile or more from school;
junior high students if they live at least 2 1/2 miles away; high school
students if they live four miles away. Students who don't meet the distance
requirements may walk to bus stops and pay to ride if there's room. New Haven
Unified's distance requirement was similarly increased.; Palo Alto schools
will continue to supply bus transportation, but with fewer routes and stops.
The district plans to ask parents for a voluntary contribution ranging from
$150 to $250 per student a year.;    Q My child isn't going to college. Have
technical courses also been cut?;    A Traditional technical programs have
been pruned for years. Most districts, rather than cutting programs entirely,
are shifting the focus: more computers and less wood shop.;    The Central
County Occupational Center offers Vocational Ed to high school students.
Contact your school or call (408) 723-6400.;    San Jose Unified will begin a
"middle college" program this fall, in which kids who are bored with high
school -- but who are bright and want a future in college -- can attend school
at San Jose City College. The program is available only to about 60 students;
contact your assistant principal.  </TEXT>
