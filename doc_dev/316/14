<LEADPARA>  TIPS GLEANED from the three-day class for police officers that also are
helpful to all bicyclists:;   BASIC EQUIPMENT: The important factors in buying
a bike are durability, simplicity of features, low maintenance and price. You
can spend as little or as much as you want -- set a budget. What's more, it's
vital that the bicycle fit the rider and that the rider feel comfortable with
the equipment. Take a couple of test rides.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A bike that doesn't fit is not just uncomfortable to ride, it's also
dangerous because the rider cannot maintain his or her balance, and -- in
reaching for the pedals -- is not in complete control of the bike.;  
MAINTENANCE: For serious riders who peddle 65 to 100 miles a week, a major
bike overhaul is recommended once a year. That includes disassembling,
cleaning, lubricating and adjusting a variety of parts, including the bottom
bracket, free wheel, headset, hubs and pedals.;   The instructors also
recommend a basic tune-up every three months to adjust and check for wear on
many of the bike's moving parts, including the cables, bike chain, brake pads,
deraillers, toe clips, quick-release levers, tires and rims.;   Many bike
shops offer free or discounted 30-, 60- and 90-day tune-ups with the sale of a
new bike.;   THEFT PREVENTION: Always lock a bike when it's left unattended.
But here's another suggestion: Put the bike in a very high or very low gear
whenever you leave it.;   That way, even if you forget to lock it or if the
lock or chain is cut, it will be difficult for the thief to make a quick
getaway. Either he'll be spinning his wheels -- literally -- or he'll be
huffing and puffing to get going.;   RIDING IN CROWDS: Rather than coasting
through the congestion of crowds and pumping your brakes hard when necessary,
you're better off shifting into a fairly high gear, continuing a constant
rotation of the pedals and squeezing the hand brakes lightly and consistently.
It helps control the bike and your sense of balance on the bike.;  
INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCED TECHNIQUES: Every road surface poses a different set
of challenges for the bicyclist. But some rules are constant:;   "It's very
important to keep your knees bent. They're your shock absorbers," instructor
Gary McLaughlin said. "It's also important whenever you ride your bike to keep
your elbows bent. They're your shock absorbers, too.";   Going down any hill,
McLaughlin recommended that the bike's wheels be straight, and that bikers
keep their feet up and parallel and their weight back. Shifting your weight
back gives the back tire more traction and the rider more control.;   When
riding on flat, slick surfaces, like bricks or wet cement and asphalt, slow
the bike down and use both front and back brakes.;   McLaughlin recommended
during the class that bikers riding down a steep, hard-packed dirt hill do
most of the braking with the back brake and use the front brake sparingly.;  
If the surface is soft -- loose dirt, sand or deep gravel -- avoid using the
front brake entirely. Allowing the front wheel to rotate unencumbered will
allow the bicyclist to "ride the bike through," McLaughlin said, without
slowing down the bike to the point where the rider goes over the handlebars.; 
 When riding uphill on a muddy surface, the police officers recommend shifting
your weight to the middle of the bike and using a low gear. In fact, when
pedaling in any soggy or muddy surfaces, they recommend using a low gear and
pedaling continually.  </TEXT>
