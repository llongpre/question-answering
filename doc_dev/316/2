<LEADPARA>  A San Jose teacher has found a novel way to keep troubled kids coming to
school. He takes them out of the classroom -- and puts them on bicycles.;   
Avie Katz runs San Jose's only school on wheels, a program he says may be the
only one of its kind in the country. The class is a last stop for teens who
have been kicked out of more traditional schools.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In Katz's summer program, the 14 students spend most of their days on
10-speed bicycles, traveling around the South Bay to visit centers of history,
religion, culture, economics and current events. They spend the rest of their
time in classroom lessons and working on their bicycles.;    "I used to sit
down and not do anything in school," said 16-year-old Osvaldo. "Now I'm
learning about new cultures, visiting museums. It changes your life.";   
Program's focus;  Katz says that besides building their minds, the program
focuses on building their strength, stamina and independence by increasing
their ability to ride and maintain their bicycles. The course, which runs from
June to mid-August, takes longer and tougher rides, ending with a 50-mile trip
from the Moorpark Community Center campus on Fruitvale Avenue to Menlo Park
for a tour of Sunset magazine.;    "It's a catalyst for learning," said Bob
Michels, principal of the community center. "It shows the students that if
they set goals, they can reach them. So many students don't feel they can do
certain things. When they focus in, they can and they do. It does a lot for
the kids' self-esteem and self-image.";    Katz, an avid cyclist and bike
builder, began the class nine years ago as an alternative to a one-hour gym
class at another school. With the help of donations from local bike shops and
a $450 equipment budget, he turned it into a full-time summer program offered
through the Santa Clara County Office of Education.;    Students have visited
the Peralta Adobe, San Jose's Museum of Art and the Triton Art Museum in Santa
Clara, a San Jose fire station, De Anza College's Planetarium and the Mercury
News building. They will study plate tectonics in Los Gatos and visit
Bullwinkle's to learn how to make pizza.;    "It's a chance for them to see a
side of life they wouldn't normally see," Katz said.;    Besides the
traditional blackboard, their classroom has a sophisticated bike repair shop
where students learn mechanics on the fleet of aging bikes.;    Katz said that
most of the students, who are in their mid-teens, have had troubles in school
that are the result of broken homes or emotional disabilities. Some were gang
members, auto thieves or chronic fighters before entering the program and many
spent time in the criminal justice system, which often has referred students
to the program.;    "When you have kids with visible disabilities, you know
they have a handicap," said Michels. "You can't see the handicap with some of
these kids, but it's there.";    Lesson in Buddhism;  On Monday, they visited
an 87-year-old Buddhist temple in San Jose's Japantown, learning from a priest
about philosophy, Buddhist symbolism and racial discrimination.;    An
outsider would have trouble telling the group from any other class. Members
were polite, asked intelligent questions and carefully rode more than four
miles each way in a tight line. When one got a flat tire, the others stopped
to help.;    Their stories tell you this isn't the average class.;    "I stole
a car," said 15-year-old Draden. "I stole your wife's car.";    "I fought with
teachers," said 14-year-old Sonna. "I thought I could get away with
everything.";    With two weeks to go, the students said the course has helped
them. Some said they want to go to college someday or find good jobs. Others
say they just want to get through high school.;    Dung, 17, said he couldn't
stay in school because of fighting. Now, however, he is the one to whom the
others turn when they need mechanical help.;    On the ride, he stops often to
tighten a seat, patch a tire or true a wheel. His teachers say he has learned
responsibility in the class. Dung said that before taking the class, he didn't
know how to work on a bike.;    "I hope to go to college after," he said. "Or
maybe I'll be a bike mechanic."  </TEXT>
