<LEADPARA>  THERE HAS been a nationwide push in the last five years to teach children
about bicycle safety. But an increasing majority of cyclists are adults, many
of whom are left to rely on the rules of the road and a touch of instinct when
it comes to riding safely.;    While the number of fatalities each year from
roadway biking accidents has remained fairly constant in the last decade, an
increasing percentage has been among adult riders.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an organization affiliated with
the insurance industry, reports that 43 percent of the 821 bike-related deaths
reported in 1989 involved riders who were 21 years old and older. In 1980, the
adult group accounted for 31 percent of the 965 fatalities.;    Part of the
increase can be explained by sheer numbers. "Fewer children are riding, and
more adults are," said Jim Fremont, a spokesman for the Bicycle Institute of
America, an industry trade group.;    The number of adults who ride bikes
regularly (at least once a week) has doubled in the last five years. The total
has increased from 12 million cyclists to 25 million in 1990, according to
estimates from the institute.;    But part of the increase in adult fatalities
can also be attributed to the resistance of riders to wearing helmets.
Findings at the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Seattle
indicate that 80 percent of bicycle fatalities are directly related to head
injuries. Yet only 5 to 16 percent of all cyclists wear helmets.;    Then
there is the mountain bike factor. Since 1981, the coaster-brake (or
foot-brake) bikes popular among youths have given way to a surging mountain
bike market. The Bicycle Institute said that more than 5 million of the 10
million bikes sold last year were mountain bikes; the figure is expected to
rise to more than 6 million this year.;    Of the 93 million cyclists in the
United States, 15 million are riding mountain bikes, cycling's fastest growing
segment. The number reflects a three-fold increase in the last three years,
and is still growing.;    Wearing a helmet is the most constructive way to
avoid injury while riding. Yet few cyclists wear them. Trying to convince
people to wear the protective headgear has become the main thrust of advocacy
groups and manufacturers.;    The League of American Wheelmen, a 22,000-member
bicycling organization based in Baltimore, approved a resolution that cyclists
participating in its national and regional rallies must wear helmets. The
requirement goes into effect in September.;    Specialized Bicycle Components,
a mountain bike manufacturer in Morgan Hill, is in the midst of a safety
promotional campaign that focuses on helmets.;    The company has offered to
give a $60 helmet to consumers who purchase one of three of its bikes. The
company's president, Michael Sinyard, asserts that a helmet is equivalent to
an air bag in a car.;    "We're offering helmets as standard equipment, and
we're asking the retailers to join us in this effort," said Sinyard.  </TEXT>
