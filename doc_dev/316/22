They remember the little-known towns along America's rural highways: De Quincy, 
La., or Hamlet, N.C., or St. Charles, Minn. They talk about riding their 
bicycles 70 miles a day, about sleeping in YMCAs, high-school gymnasiums or 
private homes, about pitching in to help community groups paint fences or feed 
the homeless. And mostly they recall their wonderful conversations with 
Americans of every stripe. 
</P>
<P>
They are the alumni of a phenomenon called Bike-Aid, a cross-country bicycle 
trip gearing up for its fifth summer. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some really beautiful people out there," says Judi Fox, a recent 
graduate in economics from UC San Diego. "I felt much more American at the end 
of this trip -- and I also felt that I really loved the American people." 
</P>
<P>
For Fox, "this trip" was last summer's five-week, 2,000-mile ride from Austin, 
Tex., to Washington with 12 other bicyclists. The goal: to raise money for 
locally initiated development projects in Third World countries funded by the 
Overseas Development Network, Bike-Aid's parent organization. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, nearly 400 cyclists, ranging from teen-agers to a 61-year-old 
grandmother from Miami, have ridden up mountains and across windy plains -- and 
raised more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 bikers who will participate this summer, riding five different 
cross-country routes to the nation's capital (from Seattle; Portland, Ore.; San 
Francisco; Los Angeles and Austin), are each asked to solicit $2,000 in pledges 
from friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Like other large-scale events -- the 1985 Live-Aid concert to aid victims of 
Ethiopian famine and the 1986 Hands Across America effort, which contributed 
funds to the homeless and needy -- Bike-Aid seeks to raise local and national 
awareness about overseas problems and contribute funds for grass-roots 
development projects. 
</P>
<P>
The ride is not a race, say the organizers, but a chance to learn about 
community challenges and successes here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty intense experience," says Cathy McGovern, one of two 
coordinators for this year's Bike-Aid, which begins June 17 (July 16 from 
Austin) and ends Aug. 21 at the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The bikers take pride in their contributions to Third World development. They 
also take a few layover days along the way to work on projects in host 
communities: McGovern remembers the Sunday they agreed to "paint a porch in 
south Chicago," only to discover that the porch was a three-tiered structure on 
a refurbished tenement that took a squad of bicyclists more than a day to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever they go, says Benay Lazo, the other Bike-Aid coordinator at the 
group's San Francisco office, the bikers make a lasting impression. "They touch 
and inspire people in the host communities," she says, recalling her own 
experiences with after-dinner community meetings and noontime conversations 
with passers-by at country stores. She says the funds raised and sent overseas 
can have a significant effect. But the real benefit, she insists, lies in "what 
happens to the cyclist." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Kahrl, a recent Harvard University graduate who rode in both 1988 and 1989 
and now coaches track in Bath, Maine, agrees. "I would say I learned to care," 
he says when asked how the experience changed him. "I saw a lot of people 
helping others -- people who had very little to start with, dedicating their 
lives to bettering the lot of others rather than going to Wall Street and 
earning a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
For Andy Yates, a third-year graduate student in engineering-economic systems 
at Stanford University, the experience provided "a foundation and a personal 
belief about major problems and what would be a good approach to solving them." 
</P>
<P>
What most impressed him, he says, was the fact that "the middle part of the 
country seems to be disappearing quickly. A lot of the small towns, 
particularly the farming communities, are closing up. They used to have two or 
three grocery stores; now they don't have any, and you have to ride maybe 40 
miles to the next big town." 
</P>
<P>
He worries that "if you were to do this ride in 20 years, it might be extremely 
difficult to find small towns along the back roads. You're going to be confined 
to riding along interstates and eating at McDonald's and staying in Motel 6's." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of linking bicycling and third-world development came from Nazir 
Ahmad, who with his younger brother, Kamal, founded ODN in 1982. He seized on 
cycling in part because of the powerful metaphors it presented. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling, other than walking, is the most common form of transportation in the 
world," he says. He credits the idea of a cross-country student ride to a 
summer trek called Harvard Rides for Life, which followed a single route. ODN 
added multiple routes -- in part, he says, because there is "a tendency to 
think of development as all going the same way, and yet here were those 
different routes going to the same end." 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that most of the nation's decisions about development issues are 
made in East or West Coast power centers, and that "middle America," where the 
cyclists of necessity spend most of their time, often getting "left behind or 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he says students needed to learn how to raise funds for causes they 
support. "I have always thought of Bike-Aid's fund-raising as an investment in 
learning," he says. "It's a very empowering process to know that you can raise 
resources to do the things you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
As he raises funds for this summer's ride, Kahrl agrees. "It's not only that we 
can make a difference but that we have to," he says. "People need to care; they 
need to make a difference."
