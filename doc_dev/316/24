<LEADPARA>  Bicycle riders soon will have to strap on safety helmets to go riding in
Chico's noted Bidwell Park under what may be the first city law mandating
helmets for adult bicyclists in the United States.;    Concerned over a
growing number of bike injuries, the City Council has ruled that beginning
July 1 people peddling through most parts of Bidwell Park will have to don
safety helmets or face $35 fines.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CHICO'S HELMET LAW FOR ADULT BICYCLISTS MAY
BE A FIRST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The 2,400-acre park is one of the largest municipal preserves in the
country and is a regional attraction for bicyclists, as well as for local
college students and others.;    "This is the first known city" to adopt such
a law, Bidwell Park and Playground Commissioner Bob Malowney said Wednesday.; 
  "We get inquiries from all over the U.S. and from Europe on how to maintain
parks for the safety of riders," he said. Helmets that meet the specifications
of the Chico ordinance cost between $50 and $70, Malowney said.;    Many
jurisdictions require helmets for children on bikes, but adults haven't been
regulated, said backers of the Chico ordinance.;    Santa Clara is considering
a law similar to Chico's to protect bike riders there, City Attorney Richard
Denhalter said.;    Under the Chico ordinance passed Tuesday night, bike
riders will have to wear helmets in Bidwell Park except on paved roads that
border the small section of the park that is developed with swimming pools and
baseball fields. But bareheaded bicyclists will not be tagged with citations
right away, park director Kevin Cunningham said Wednesday.;    The helmet
ordinance was adopted by the council on a narrow 4-3 vote, with backers
arguing it was a matter of public safety and foes claiming it was unnecessary
government interference. The discussion was similar to that voiced at the
state level in recent years before Gov. Pete Wilson last month signed into law
a bill requiring all motorcycle riders to wear helmets.;    Wilson's
predecessor, George Deukmejian, had twice vetoed the measure as an intrusion
into personal choice.;    Chico Mayor Mary Andrews, who opposed the bike
helmet law, echoed the sentiments expressed by Deukmejian and other foes of
government-mandated safety measures.;    "I just have a real hard time with us
telling everyone what to do to stay safe and how to do it," she said. "Pretty
soon, we're going to have rules saying when to read the rules.";    Jessica
Strock, the chairwoman of the Butte County chapter of the Libertarian Party,
also criticized the ordinance.  </TEXT>
