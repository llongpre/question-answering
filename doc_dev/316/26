<P>
If you ride bicycles at all, chances are this has happened to you: You're 
heading down Coast Highway, maintaining a steady 18 m.p.h., feeling strong, 
when without warning a pack of riders zips by, their seemingly effortless 
cadence a smooth 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In seconds, it seems, they are gone. And all you remember is the silence of the 
paceline, the way their legs seemed to move in total unison, the pack wasting 
no energy as it worked as one, each rider using the draft and taking turns at 
the front in balletlike symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
This is cycling as it is supposed to be -- the pack working as one, the 
paceline straight and the speed steady, the legs pumping in harmony, backs flat 
and heads low, elbows bent. 
</P>
<P>
What these riders have that you don't is technique. It's not the $2,500 bikes 
they may be on but the knowledge of gearing and drafting and cadence that sets 
them apart and allows them to ride faster and longer and smoother. And 
unfortunately, it's not something that comes naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Put two riders side by side, the same age and in the same physical condition, 
both of them avid enthusiasts putting in 150 miles a week, and the one who will 
excel on the hills and keep it at a steady 30 m.p.h. on the flats will be the 
one who has paid attention to the subtleties of technique. 
</P>
<P>
You can put in 200 miles a week and have quads the size of an oak tree, but if 
you take a hill in the wrong gear, or fall even so much as half a bike length 
off the paceline, that group riding in formation like the Blue Angels will 
leave you behind like some kind of wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
Fast road bike clubs see this happen all the time. They come upon a lone rider 
astride a shiny custom bike equipped with triathlete bars, who jumps on the 
rear of the paceline. Everything is fine until the first hill, or when the club 
picks it up on the flats, and suddenly that interloper is 100 yards back, 
exhausted and spent, the victim of too little attention to the things that make 
great riders great. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson here is if you're serious about biking at all and are committed to 
putting in the miles, you'd do well to pay attention to experienced riders and 
racers. It will go a long way toward improving overall performance -- without 
increasing your mileage. 
</P>
<P>
And even if your goal isn't to keep up with the racers, there's nothing like 
organized group riding to pick up some tips from the old pros. 
</P>
<P>
Most bikers find it's a small step from those lone rides with one or two 
friends to the excitement of group riding. It's like going from a disposable 
camera to mastering a Nikon and setting up a darkroom in your garage. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the popularity of biking here, Orange County offers a wide cross 
section of organized clubs catering to everything from the weekend recreational 
cyclist looking to put in a slow 25 miles to the serious riders and racers who 
think nothing of knocking off a 70-miler averaging a quick 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the number of clubs, there seems to be something for just about 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about cycling," said biking enthusiast Rudy Fernandez, 52, of 
Irvine, "is that no matter at what level you are doing it, you can find a club 
to ride with, no matter how old you are. There are people out there 40, 60 and 
70 who don't give an inch to anyone younger than them." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who has been riding for years, has seen the sport through boom and 
bust times and said the current cycle is one of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"You have all kinds of organized bike tours, different types of clubs, the U.S. 
Cycling Federation racing, the touring clubs and then all the small clubs that 
take it quite seriously. There's something for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The largest local club is the Orange County Wheelmen, which boasts 950 members 
and offers training classes, rides for beginners and club-sponsored century 
rides of 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
If you're into the social aspect of riding or merely want to increase your 
speed and distance while picking up some valuable tips, this may be the group 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club of Irvine is a recreational, non-racing club offering over 40 
rides a month. It too offers non-threatening rides for beginners and longer 
rides for the recreational cyclist, and you can learn something about pack 
riding and staying out of the gutter after a few trips out. 
</P>
<P>
A slew of smaller clubs, many sponsored by local bike shops, offer everything 
from easy recreational rides (say 20 miles and a stop for brunch) to fast-paced 
60-milers with no stops. 
</P>
<P>
More demanding than the Wheelmen or the Irvine club and requiring a greater 
commitment -- not to mention experience and ability -- are clubs such as those 
sponsored by Bicycles Etc. of El Toro and BS Bicisport of Laguna Hills. Both 
offer coaching and emphasize technique and speed over distance. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycles Etc. is a co-sponsor of the Nissan-Schwinn team that races 
competitively in U.S. Cycling Federation events. At Bicisport, former Romanian 
Olympic cyclist Marcel Calborn has formed a core group composed of racers and 
professional men -- ranging in age from the mid-20s to mid-50s -- who ride five 
to six times a week. 
</P>
<P>
For those bold enough to think they can move with the best, there are several 
rides that attract the local elite. But be warned: Don't bother even showing up 
unless you're ready to ride like the wind. These men and women are fast. 
</P>
<P>
Como Street: This curiously named ride (there is no Como Street in Irvine but 
apparently there used to be one in the area when the ride began in the 1950s) 
starts on Jamboree Road west of the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine every Sunday 
around 8:30 a.m. The ride usually runs between 36 and 45 miles and has been 
known to attract up to 300 riders. The pack normally splits as the weak lose 
the draft and fall behind. 
</P>
<P>
* Coffee Crew: This 7 a.m. Saturday ride follows a 35-mile loop and starts in 
Corona del Mar. Not for the weak at heart. 
</P>
<P>
* Foodpark: This starts at 8:30 a.m. Saturdays at Foodpark in Irvine and runs 
for about 35 miles. Another fast one but not as demanding as Como Street or 
Coffee Crew. 
</P>
<P>
And finally there is the "Ziggurat" training ride, a 1.4-mile loop around the 
pyramid-shaped Chet Holifield federal building in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The "Zig" takes place each Tuesday and Thursday starting around 5:30 p.m. and 
ending at dusk. A pack of usually 50 to 60 shows up and does about 40 miles 
around the loop, taking 90-degree corners at 40 m.p.h. and riding so close you 
can read the label off your neighbor's bike jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Szkalak, 37, a triathlete who now devotes most of his energy to bike 
racing, notes that the Zig can be particularly demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"This ride is occasioned by world champions from time to time," said Szkalak, 
who lives in Dana Point. "It is not unusual for pro riders to seek out the Zig 
or Como Street when they're in the area." 
</P>
<P>
But with so many clubs and organized rides around, you don't have to compete at 
the Zig to enjoy cycling. Still, with a little attention to technique, you 
might think you'd want to give it try.
