<LEADPARA>  HERE'S THE scenario: You and Greg LeMond set out on a bicycle ride through the
Santa Cruz Mountains. Odds are, even with luck on your side, that LeMond will
be showered and dressed before you reach the halfway point.;   There's a way
to change that scenario.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What if the two of you are on a tandem, one of those bicycles built for
two.;   "These things are the equalizer," says Darryl Chase, owner of Willow
Glen Bike Shop. "You can get two people with totally different riding
capabilities and they'll always ride together.";   While tandems have been
around for years, Chase, 26, recently discovered an Oregon company that is
making them as mountain bikes rather than road bikes.;   Chase's search for a
tandem began after he found himself speeding by his wife, Linda, when they
rode conventional mountain bikes.;   "With this bike I can ride as fast as I
want," said Chase, who purchased the bright yellow tandem last month from the
Burley Design Cooperative of Eugene, Ore.;    Santana Cycles of Claremont is
perhaps the most sophisticated manufacturer of the tandem mountain bike.
Santana's top-of-the-line model -- the "Picante" -- has a nivacrome frame,
Italian components and sells for a whopping $3,995.;    "They make the best
tandems in the world," said Darryl Noda, general manager of the Bicycle
Outfitter in Los Altos.;    Chase's bike, Burley's top model, is on display at
his Willow Glen store and has been an added attraction for his customers.;   
"I've had about 16 people express interest in it," he said. "People will walk
by the shop and peek in just to see the bike.";    The 40-pound Burley "Bongo"
sells for $2,000.;    That price, says Todd Nealson, service manager at Any
Mountain Bikes in Cupertino, is about top dollar for most tandems. A
bottom-of-the-line Burley tandem isn't cheap, either -- it runs about $1,000.;
   "The big difference between the two (Burley) prices is the components,"
Chase said. "The equipment is a lot better on the top bike.";    In addition
to the Bongo's chromoly-steel frame being custom built, the bike has two
variations of brakes -- cantilevers on both wheels and drums on the back.;  
Chase has substituted nobby mountain-bike tires for the smoother and narrower
"slicks.";   "The slicks give you a better ride on the street," Chase said.;  
Any Mountain Bikes doesn't sell the tandem, and the Willow Glen Bike Shop only
has the Chases' bike in stock. Chase, however, said the bike can be ordered
and delivered in three days.;   "Everybody loves a bike for two," he said.
"With this bike, you can hold a conversation while riding, which is a lot
safer than talking to each other on single bikes.";   Because the bicycle is
about seven feet in length, it's tough to imagine anyone rolling through
treacherous terrain. And many don't.;   "Most will use it for light trails,"
Chase said. "The tandem is much faster on flat ground.";   Chase and his wife
average about 27 mph and have reached speeds of near 50 mph. They ride it
about 60 miles a week.;   The front man on a tandem is known as the "captain."
He is normally the bigger of the two riders and controls the steering, braking
and gear shifting.;   The second rider is called the "stoker." That person has
one responsibility: pedal.;   "People think the person in the back can sit
back and say, 'Aw, I'll sit back and let the other guy do the work,' " Chase
said. "But it doesn't work that way."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Burley Design
Cooperative can be reached at 4080 Stewart Road, Eugene, Ore., 97402, or by
phone at (503) 687-1644.; Santana Cycles can be reached at 488 West First
Street, Claremont, CA 91711, or by phone at (714) 621-6943.  </TEXT>
