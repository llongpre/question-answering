for the drinking man

'I've never made a table - I'd love to have a go,' said the artist over a
pint in a pub in London's St James's.
IT ended the yearning, which began in my teens, to own a port railway; for
within a few months Richard Grasby delivered a round oaken dining table
complete with the 'railway' on which the decanters coast.
Port railways were something we speculated about as impecunious youngsters
learning the art and craft of imbibing. No-one I knew then had ever seen
one, much less owned one. Just how rare they are can be judged from how
little space they are given in The Book of Wine Antiques (Robin Butler and
Gillian Walkling, Antique Collectors Club, 1986) which has four pictures of
wine wagons but none at all of table-top railways for liquor. The authors
say only that 'wagons enjoyed very short popularity at the beginning of the
19th century.'
In fact, I had pretty well given up hope of ever finding a port railway
when, on a visit to Churchill College, Cambridge, in the late 1970s I saw my
first.
It happened like this. The Master, then Sir William Hawthorne, the inventive
engineer, was showing me around the college, including the Lodge where he
lived. He said he had something he thought might particularly interest me.
He told me how Brendan Bracken, who died in 1959, had willed an
idiosyncratic collection of furniture to the trustees of the fund for the
proposed Churchill College. It was just enough to furnish the dining room of
the Lodge.
Bracken had been Sir Winston Churchill's friend and colleague in Cabinet
during the Second World War, and was also publisher of the post-war
Financial Times.
Bracken had explained his intentions regarding the furniture in a letter to
a friend: 'In distant times the comforts and dignity of the Masters' Lodges
encouraged all sorts of useful people to seek their hospitality. And so I
hope the Churchill College will not only be acclaimed as a house of
learning, but also as one of discerning hospitality.'
Centrepiece of Bracken's dining suite is a round mahogany table, early 19th
century, 5 ft in diameter, seating eight comfortably. It has a moulded
border and stands on a carved, tulip-shaped plinth.
What the Master really wanted to show me was the port railway, also carved
from mahogany. This is a circular track of six segments which lock together,
rather like those Hornby train sets we used to get at Christmas, to form a
railway with wooden rails 5 in apart, lying 3 in from the edge of the table.
Once the ladies had left, the butler would assemble this track.
On the wooden rails rides a curved coaster or wine tray, long enough to
carry three or four decanters. The coaster, of polished mahogany, has six
wooden wheels.
If it has a fault, this graceful aid to good living appears to crowd
inconveniently close to the diner, who must reach across the track to find
his glass. But it has been beautifully wrought to allow the liquor to coast
smoothly in response to the gentlest push.
The Master related how once he had produced it to entertain a Soviet
engineer at the Lodge - 'to give him an idea how the capitalists live,' he
chuckled. His guest evinced not the slightest surprise.
I was much more appreciative than the Russian, but no nearer my ambition of
owning such a toy, for the antique was clearly not the Master's to sell. It
had been left by Bracken in perpetuity to the Lodge. Its essential
simplicity set me thinking, however, of having one made if only I could find
a sympathetic craftsman.
Richard Grasby and I had met in the cause of making educational aids; he as
artist with special flair for presenting technical complexities in bold yet
simple graphics. Might it be possible to avoid the complexity of a separate
track by grooving the table? I inquired.
Grasby seized the suggestion and was off to his studio in Bedchester,
Dorset, to experiment. Within days he was back to say that he believed, from
trials with a little wooden model of one axle, we might manage with just a
single groove to guide the coaster.
He designed a round table 5 ft in diameter with a single circular groove 9
in from the edge, supported by a central pillar of splayed legs. Like
Bracken's table, it seats eight.
The table top is cut from four planks of prime English oak, 1 1/2 in thick.
From the offcuts he fashioned the legs. Their central pillar is decorated
with carved wooden wheels that match the wheels of the coaster.
The wine coaster is a curved oaken tray about 15 in in length with eight
boxwood wheels which run on brass spindles in brass bearings. Only the inner
wheels are flanged for the groove. Grasby has left enough slack in the
coaster's suspension to produce a slight rattle, evocative of a rail train,
as the port railway carries decanters from glass to glass.
The essential simplicity of his scheme is also the saving grace of this
splendid piece of self-indulgence. Once the tablecloth is removed the
railway is ready, needing no butler to lay the track. If my wife had a worry
it was that the groove might clog with crumbs, giving the port a rough ride.
I am pleased to report that such is the care the artist lavished on carving
and waxing his unique work, that it circulates without even the hint of a
hiccup.
