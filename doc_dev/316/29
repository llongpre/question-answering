<LEADPARA>  IN MY last column, I recounted how I became a mountain bicyclist. I wanted to
show that it is not so hard. It can even be fun.;    Now, what you need to get
started.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Requirements are simple: You need a bike, a helmet, a tool kit (at least a
flat-tire repair kit and pump), bike clothes -- optional although very
practical -- and most of all a willingness to go your own way.;    It's
important to have the right equipment, and for women that means asking your
bike store to fit your bike to you.;    What makes a bike fit a woman? For me,
a 16-inch standard frame. I cut the handlebars shorter so they are about the
width of my shoulders. I changed the stem (it attaches the handlebars to the
bike) so I could reach the bars.;    I put on smaller pedals because I have
smaller feet (at least smaller than the average pedal). I made sure I got a
woman's saddle, which is shorter and wider. I have smaller brake levers (on
the handlebars) so I can reach them comfortably.;    I wear clothing designed
for women (shorter waist, more panels).;    That works for me. My sister, who
is bigger than me, didn't make any changes to her bike.;    Ask the bike shop
staff what's right for you. If they are a good shop, they will know what to
do. If they don't, go to another shop.;    Remember, buy the bike you like.
Buy the one that fits you. Don't let your well-meaning friend or spouse
convince you about a bike from reading about it in the latest bike magazine or
because it's the one they ride. Go your own way and buy what you like.;    The
bike industry is recognizing that women make up more than 60 percent of new
riders and is making equipment for women.;    When I went to buy my first
bike, I had no idea what anything was. Since then, I've learned a few basics
about mountain bikes.;    A true mountain bike has that third chain ring in
front, commonly referred to as the "granny gear." It's the low gear that
allows you to still pedal when going uphill -- a very important part (in
theory anyway). The right bike size is determined by straddling the top tube
and having at least three fingers clearance between you and the bike.;    I
prefer a smaller bike, but if you don't plan on being off road much, bigger is
fine.;    And where to put the pump? Wherever it fits. I don't recommend along
the top tube because you can't carry your bike with the pump there, and I'm
sure you will carry it sometime. You can buy pumps that are small enough for
any bike.;    Mountain biking has opened up many doors for me. I am much more
willing to try something new. Since I've been biking, I've tried windsurfing,
telemark skiing and kayaking -- and I did not grow up a jock. I have seen much
more of this country from the seat of my bike. And when I'm on my bike, the
worries of the day drop away.;    So get a bike, find a willing friend, and go
your own way.  </TEXT>
