UNEMPLOYMENT: CUTS IN STATE FUNDS SET BACK HOPES OF INDEPENDENCE FOR A CREW OF 
GROUNDSKEEPERS.

State budget cuts mean more than just numbers on a page to George Schwenk, one 
of eight people with mental disabilities who began working with the grounds 
maintenance crew at Pierce College this summer, only to be laid off a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
For Schwenk, 38, the budget-triggered layoff was a setback in his quest for an 
independent adult life, a quest that began more than seven years ago when he 
left home to participate in a state-funded work training program. 
</P>
<P>
Schwenk was one of the most recent victims of a wave of state budget cuts that 
hit Pierce College, beginning last spring and continuing through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sad," Schwenk said Wednesday, reflecting on his and his fellow 
workers' reaction to losing their full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been trying to keep busy -- walking, riding his bike and 
wandering in a shopping mall, imagining what it would be like to work there. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the training program's assistance, finding new work "takes time" for 
those with disabilities, Schwenk said. "You have to be honest with yourself. 
You don't want to get into a job you can't handle and have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the men and women stopped working at Pierce, their thorough 
raking, sweeping and trash pickup were already missed, said Bernardine 
Pregerson, a microbiology instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very demoralizing on campus now to see the filth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty introduced by the budget undulations put Schwenk and other 
clients of Work Training Programs Inc. of Chatsworth on an emotional roller 
coaster. The agency, funded by the state Department of Rehabilitation and the 
Department of Developmental Services, guides participants through a progression 
of training, working and living situations aimed at achieving independence from 
their families and from government support. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, eight clients of the Chatsworth agency were hired by Pierce under a 
20-week contract, which campus officials said was renewed in February. Then 
they were told in April that their contract would be canceled in 30 days, as 
part of an effort to make up a nearly $1-million deficit faced by the Los 
Angeles Community College District, which administers Pierce and eight other 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the college district Board of Trustees approved another 20-week 
contract. Two of the original group of eight, who quit lower-paying jobs to 
return to Pierce, were joined by Schwenk and five other new workers, said Gail 
Peters, manager of Work Training Programs. 
</P>
<P>
But days before they were to start in July, Peters received a call from Pierce 
College President Dan Means saying the financial picture had changed again: 
$1.2 million had been sliced from the Pierce College budget by the district, 
partly because state lottery revenues were lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing was terrible," Means said. "We had to let them go again, which I 
was sorry to see. . . . The cuts were just so large; it was a big hunk of 
money. And we had to protect the educational programs." 
</P>
<P>
The crew had done such a good job and the college felt so responsible for 
giving them false hope that the Pierce College Foundation agreed to support the 
program for a month, at a cost of about $5,700, Means said. 
</P>
<P>
College administrators suggested that the workers could continue helping out 
their maintenance crews as unpaid volunteers until they found other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Peters rejected that as inappropriate, but she took the blame for misleading 
college administrators into thinking that was an option by mentioning volunteer 
programs her agency coordinates for other, less-skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not normal for an able-bodied, hard-working adult to go to work some 
place for no pay and our program is developed around normalization with a 
capital N," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwenk is involved in the segment of the program for the most independent 
participants. He lives in a Canoga Park apartment with another program client. 
Like others among the Work Training Programs clients, he cannot read, but in 
the past has managed to work in areas such as maintenance, factory assembly and 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Program instructors emphasize saving for unexpected unemployment, which Peters 
said is common. All eight of the men and women laid off from Pierce also 
receive Social Security disability payments of up to $630 a month. 
</P>
<P>
None of the eight has a new job yet, Peters said. She is optimistic, however, 
that she will be able to find employment for all of them within a month. 
</P>
<P>
"This group here is a group that could handle any kind of job," she said.
