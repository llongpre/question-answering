<LEADPARA>  FOR the 93 million American bicyclists, night is a dangerous time to ride.;  
Almost half of the 850 fatal bike accidents in 1990 occurred between 6 p.m.
and 6 a.m., even though fewer people cycle at night, according to the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. More than 90 percent of the cyclists
were killed when their bikes collided with motor vehicles.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That's why a growing number of bicycle groups are encouraging cyclists to
improve their visibility at night with brighter headlights, reflective
clothing and even brake lights -- measures beyond those required by law.;  
"When it comes to riding at night, you are at much greater risk," said William
Wilkinson, executive director of the Bicycle Federation of America, a national
non-profit organization that promotes improved safety of bicycles. "The
prevailing philosophy is to do whatever you can to make yourself visible.";  
The Consumer Product Safety Commission mandates that all new bikes have at
least 10 reflectors. But lights are not required by the commission -- a fact
that means new bikes are not legally equipped to operate on streets at night.;
  California requires that cyclists use a white headlight visible at night. In
addition, bikes must have a rear red reflector that can be seen when the bike
is directly in front of a car's headlights. But the law only addresses
"minimum kinds of requirements," Wilkinson said.;   Aside from buying a light,
some simple adjustments can often improve this standard equipment, reports the
September issue of American Bicyclist &amp; Motorcyclist.;   For example, wheel
reflectors can unbalance wheels and loosen spokes if they are not properly
mounted. Bags or panniers may also hide the reflectors, one reason that the
Washington Area Bicycling Association recommends that cyclists wear reflective
vests and tape on their helmets.;   But look for models of vests that are made
specifically for cycling. The reason: The reflective area will still be
visible even if the rider is leaning forward on the bike. "The single most
important reflector on the bicycle" is the rear reflector, according to the
American Bicyclist. It suggests cyclists move or replace this reflector with a
larger, more visible model if racks or bags are added.;   Reflective patches
that can be sewn or attached with adhesive backing are another way to increase
visibility. But experts advise that cyclists check how well the patches are
sealed against moisture since the amount of reflection often decreases when
these materials get wet.;   A bright halogen headlight also heightens
visibility. A variety of light-weight battery packs are available, some of
them solar powered. They can be mounted on helmets or attached to handlebars.;
  Brake lights are another way to enhance safety at night. These lights turn
on when a cyclist brakes. Some also function as an additional reflector when
the light is not on, according to the American Bicyclist. One model even has
solar cells that can be recharged.;   The bottom line, Wilkinson said, "is to
make yourself look like a Christmas tree. After all, bicyclists don't walk
away from a collision with a car with just a dented fender."  </TEXT>
