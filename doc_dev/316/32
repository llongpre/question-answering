Craig Holmes was pedaling south on Balboa Avenue in the Granada Hills area last 
year when he suddenly found himself flung off his expensive racing bike and 
into the world of bicycle accident litigation. 
</P>
<P>
As the amateur marathon cyclist crossed the intersection of Rinaldi Street on 
the 20-mile commute to his job as a brewery supervisor, a car turned into the 
path of another car. The second driver decided it would be better to ram into 
the bike than to be hit by the other auto, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes was dragged and bounced along the road for 80 feet. Rough pavement broke 
his glasses and skinned his lips, face and left side. "It was like somebody 
lighting me on fire, my clothes burned into my skin so I couldn't even bleed," 
he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It took $800 to repair his expensive racing bike, hundreds more to heal his own 
wounds. In the end, he won a generous out-of-court settlement with the driver's 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
More than 89 million Americans rode bicycles last year, many lured to the sport 
by the country's fixation with health, flashy new bicycle technology and 
clothes and the star status of competing cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
But while cycling has been elevated in status, so too has it become 
increasingly risky. More than 900 bicyclists were killed last year, including 
138 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Another 500,000 ended up in hospital emergency rooms across the country -- 
suffering scrapes that cyclists call "road rash," as well as dislocated 
shoulders, smashed knees, broken bones and brain injuries. Half of the victims 
are children under 16. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more bike riders collide on the streets with car-loving citizens, 
they call on a new breed of attorney to help them seek damages. 
</P>
<P>
Known as bike lawyers, they specialize in bicycle law, advertise in bicycle 
magazines and ride to accident scenes on their own bikes to better understand 
the mechanics of the accident. Once in court, they call forth an array of 
product and safety experts who, in great detail, explain why the pedal fell 
off, why the tire left its fork and why the bicyclist could not get out of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Among the handful of Los Angeles bike attorneys is William Harris, whose first 
client seven years ago was his 14-year-old daughter, DeDe. She had been 
training for a national track championship when she was hit by a motorist 
turning left in front of her. The accident sidelined her from competition. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the insurance company wanted to treat the claim "like a 
run-of-the-mill whiplash case." The first settlement offer was low, he said, 
but he received a better one when he established that she had lost the chance 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
In untangling the case, Harris found that "police, personal injury experts and 
insurance adjusters just didn't understand the mechanics of bike accidents." So 
Harris, who bicycles more than a 100 miles a week, began to advertise in bike 
magazines and was surprised by the large response. He receives about a dozen 
inquiries a week, most involving serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Bicyclers are often treated like second-class citizens, even though legally 
they have the same responsibilities and rights that motorists do," Harris said. 
"Problems arise because motorists don't know where they are supposed to be in 
relationship to bikers." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of accidents are the fault of motorists who do not understand or 
respect bicyclists' rights, federal traffic safety experts say. But other 
accidents are caused by faulty equipment and poorly designed bike paths. Often, 
bicyclists themselves are their own enemy, failing to heed road rules or wear 
safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Except for most freeways, where they are outlawed, bicyclers have the same 
access to the roads as do cars. They are required to ride with traffic and as 
far to the right as possible, except to pass slow-moving vehicles, avoid debris 
or when the lanes are substandard widths. 
</P>
<P>
While attorneys for insurance companies argue that bicyclists have accidents 
because they break laws or are inexperienced, National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration statistics show that in most car-bicycle accidents involving 
riders over 16, the motorist usually is at fault. In those involving children 
under 16, however, the child usually is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
A tactic of insurance companies, bike lawyers claim, is to zero in on the 
alleged negligence of bicyclists, asking why they weren't wearing a helmet, 
weren't acrobatic enough to avoid the collision, or by even trying to show that 
bicyclists are "weird people." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ryan, a Los Angeles-area toy designer, said that after her bicycle 
accident in Redondo Beach in 1985, she was chastised by police and given 
inadequate legal representation. Crossing the street with the light in a 
crosswalk, Ryan said she was hit by a motorist turning left. "I was airborne 
for at least 10 feet and landed on my knees. I had a concussion, neck and back 
injuries and ended up having surgery on both knees." 
</P>
<P>
While in the emergency room, Ryan said, the investigating police officer 
lectured her. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude was that bikes don't belong on the streets and that I should have 
yielded to the car. He wrote up an unfavorable report, even though I had the 
right of way." 
</P>
<P>
The first attorney who handled her case, she said, didn't understand how 
vehicle codes pertained to bicyclists. "I lost the case in non-binding 
arbitration because she didn't explain that I was in the bike path when it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bike lawyer Harris is now handling her case. She has had more than $15,000 in 
medical bills, has been unable to climb steps, has problems with her neck and 
jaw, and has been afraid to ride on the streets. "I keep reliving that 
accident," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most lawsuits filed by injured bicyclists are settled out of court. The 
settlements often start at around $5,000 and work their way upward as the 
severity of the accident increases, some in the $250,000 range. Brain-injured 
bicyclists win the highest awards because lifetime care runs into the millions. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest awards was $8 million recently given to a Midwestern boy who 
suffered brain damage after falling from his bike when the wheel fell off on a 
railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
"How to survive is becoming the bottom line," said Alex LaRiviere, who has 
worked for the National Safety Council on bike safety and who investigates 
accidents for bicycle attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The second-generation owner of a San Jose bike store, LaRiviere said, "My 
father thinks someday all these investigations will do something to my mind. 
Already, I sometimes find it difficult to be a retailer and know that bicyclers 
are getting killed and mangled out there." Such accidents are beginning to 
generate calls for safer equipment, more and better designed bike paths, and 
increased education for bicyclists and motorists. In one program, errant 
bicyclists in Palo Alto are ticketed and must attend traffic school. Most 
emphasis has been placed on helmets, which studies show could prevent 85% of 
all brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst accidents occurred last year on the bicycle lane of U.S. 101 
near the Gaviota rest stop in Santa Barbara County. Five members of a race team 
had just completed a 60-mile training ride in the early morning and were 
returning home when a drunk driver crossed the white line separating cars from 
bikes and slammed into the group. 
</P>
<P>
Harold (Chip) Wessburg, a triathlete and race team coach, was killed. Ken 
Foraker, a highly ranked racer, lost a leg, and others received minor injuries. 
Recently a jury found Douglas Bishop, 57, guilty of second-degree murder and 
sentenced him to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has also had its share of gruesome accidents. Don Hendricks, a 
Fullerton College art professor, suffered fatal head injuries when a car 
slammed into him as he rode his cycle to work early one morning last February. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Pulley, a popular eighth-grader from Huntington Beach, was killed when 
she pedaled her father's bike into the path of an oncoming car while on the way 
to her job as a horse exerciser at a local stable on the last day of 
Thanksgiving weekend, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the cyclist hit in May by a car driven by a 76-year-old woman in 
Orange. The woman apparently never saw Francisco Rodriguez as she made a right 
turn, only stopping the car after she heard scraping sounds coming from the 
vehicle's undercarriage. Rodriguez, who suffered severe cuts and crushed lungs, 
died before rescue crews could pull him from beneath the car. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Staiger of Los Angeles has fought them on the streets and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Staiger, who logs thousands of miles a year on her bicycle, had qualified for 
the grueling transcontinental Race Across America in 1987 when she was hit on 
her bicycle at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Temescal Canyon in 
Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going about 12 m.p.h. and had proceeded through the intersection with 
the green light," she recalled. "I saw the car sitting at the red light. The 
driver looked right at me. But the next thing I know, she puts on the gas and 
runs into my bike. I go head over the bike and skid down the road on my 
helmet." 
</P>
<P>
Staiger competed in the race that year, but didn't finish. The next year, she 
won the 3,063-mile race with a time of 12 days, 3 hours and 55 minutes. She 
also won her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident she recalled, " I was coming down Palos Verdes Drive when a 
guy in a black Porsche with a little boy in the car kept honking his horn," she 
said. "I pulled as far to the right as possible, but he roars around me 
screaming. Then he hits his brakes on purpose and I had to go around him down 
the center line bumps to keep from running into him. He goes around me again 
and hits the brakes again. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, something just broke in me. At the stop light, I caught up with him. He 
had an open sunroof. Guess where my water bottle went?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it's the bicycle pathway that harms the bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles River Bike Trail near Paramount used to wind down to the 
riverbed at a spot where water pooled. A bicyclist, riding the path for the 
first time, slipped in the algae and crashed. He obtained a settlement, and the 
bikeway was eventually rerouted to avoid the water. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, bicyclists say, the paths, which also meander along the Santa Ana 
River and other routes in Orange County, are not policed to keep them clear of 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"I even saw a lady lay her baby down on the path to change its diaper," said 
Frederick Bodner, a 31-year-old Santa Monica mountain biker. Once, a leashed 
dog lunged and hit his riding partner's bike, sending him flying and bending 
the back wheel. But his worst experience, Bodner said, occurred on a Venice 
bike path, where a shop had set up a kite for an advertisement and the string 
strayed across the path. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the string pull down into my sunglasses, obscuring my vision," he 
recalled. "It cut my head, ripped my arm, slashed my jersey. I thought I was 
going to be decapitated." 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclists are not only pressing for safer pathways, they have argued for 
better equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"With new equipment coming out all the time, you get new injuries. You never 
know what is going to happen next," said bike lawyer Mace Simon of Los Angeles, 
who rides to accident sites on his own bike so that he can get a better idea of 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Product liability cases are on the upswing partly because of the popularity of 
mountain bikes and the lightweight materials used by manufacturers, attorneys 
said. Simon noted that there have been several recent cases involving breakage 
of the handlebar stem when bikers add extension bars out front to place 
themselves in a more aerodynamic position. 
</P>
<P>
Suing foreign bicycle makers for product liability is often a long and 
expensive task, said bike lawyer Harris. Unlike American firms, foreign 
companies are less likely to approve out-of-court settlements, and are willing 
to spend endless money to go to trial, bike lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Spiller, a Los Angeles attorney whose firm often defends bike 
manufacturers, contends that many suits brought by bicyclists are unwarranted 
and the result of "user error and lack of common sense." He said that given the 
"litigious nature" of consumers, he expects claims to soon increase to one 
claim for every 2,000 bikes produced. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, he noted, a woman was sitting on the handlebars of a bike being 
ridden by her husband. The bike hit a rut and she flew off, landed on her head 
and died two days later. The spouse filed a $6-million suit against the company 
for failing to place a warning on the bike against riding on the handlebars. 
Spiller said he was able to extricate his client from the suit, which is still 
pending against the city of St. Joseph, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, meanwhile, are taking it on themselves to toughen laws against 
dangerous cycling practices. In Westminster, a proposed new ordinance would put 
bicyclists riding on sidewalks at fault if they collide with cars leaving or 
entering driveways. 
</P>
<P>
Safety experts believe that serious injuries could drop significantly if more 
riders would wear helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all bicycle-related deaths are caused by head injuries. Of the 500,000 
bike accident victims admitted to emergency rooms each year, more than half 
suffer head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this perception that bicycles are cute toys. You can fall off a bike 
in your driveway and lie there and die from a devastating head injury because 
you didn't have a helmet on," said David Thom, a research associate at USC's 
Department of Safety Science. 
</P>
<P>
Thom noted that good helmets have been available to consumers since 1984 when 
the American National Standards Institute came up with industry standards, but 
many bicyclists refuse to wear them because they consider them hot and 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the U.S. Cycling Federation made helmets mandatory for 
sanctioned races. In most foreign races, including the Tour de France, helmets 
are not usually worn. American Greg LeMond, who won the race last year, gave 
helmets a boost by wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Stalnaker, an engineering professor at Ohio State University, is 
doing helmet studies for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He 
said the ideal helmet is one that absorbs energy of the impact and 
disintegrates, leaving the rider protected. 
</P>
<P>
However, this concept is often lost on the juries hearing bike cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If a jury sees a helmet that went through an accident without a scratch, they 
think, 'Gee, it must be a good helmet,"' Stalnaker said. "If they see one torn 
up they say, 'No wonder he's dead.' But in reality, the helmet only remains in 
good condition if it doesn't absorb enough energy and, instead, passes it on to 
the victim's head." 
</P>
<P>
Stalnaker says: "It's easier to make helmets better than to make autos 
friendlier."
