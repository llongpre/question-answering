   Consider the advantages of pedal power:
inexpensive and pollution-free. There are twice as many bicycles as
there are automobiles, yet much of the world is curiously
ambivalent toward them. Are they relics of another century or are
they the wave of the future?

   Here they come, thousands at a time steering quietly down the
streets of Amsterdam and Beijing, or a file of humped silhouettes
etched against the mountain-ocean sunset of California.
   Here they come, bicycles and their riders, caught by the dawn's
early light or the headlight's glare, pumping legs, determined
faces, wheeling to work, wheeling home, or just determined to stay
fit.
   Bicycles. There are 800 million in all, 88 million in the United
States, 300 million in China, a very personal, pollution-free mode
of transportation.
   The question is: Are they relics of another century, or are they
the wave of the future?
   The competition is the automobile, 400 million in the world. No
one in his right mind would say it's an even fight.
   But the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, a think tank,
recently published Worldwatch Paper 90 by Marcia D. Lowe with the
title ``The Bicycle. Vehicle For A Small Planet.''
   The message is that bicycles consume less energy per passenger
mile than any other form of transportation, including walking. A
cyclist can cover 3{ miles on the calories in an ear of corn, 10
miles on the 350 calories in a bowl of rice. The average American
car covers 10 miles on about half a gallon of gasoline, or 18,600
calories.
   Bicyclists do not produce smog or acid rain. They do not
endanger the ozone layer and few cyclists are pulled over for DWI.
They do produce sweat, however.
   Marcia Lowe writes that 33 states included bicycle promotion
measures in their plans to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1970.
Los Angeles would make major employers reduce the ratio of
commuting cars to employees. Other Western cities would make
employers provide bicycle parking and shower facilities.
   All of this comes 90 years after the bicycle craze crested in
America. In 1899, with automobiles not yet on the road, and public
transportation in the form of trolleys and electric trains just an
infant enterprise, the United States was selling more than a
million bicycles a year. In a nation of barely 76 million, those
were impressive figures.
   So ubiquitous were those ``safety'' bikes that they altered
American fashions. Knickers kept pants legs out of the way of chain
drives, long Norfolk jackets caught the mud, and women began to
wear shorter skirts and, heaven forfend, bloomers, so they could
ride their bikes. Whole families would go out for weekend bicycle
outings.
   Fred Zahradnik of Bicycling magazine points out that the bicycle
was a vehicle for technology as well as people. The Wright Brothers
were bicycle makers, as were hundreds of other tinkerers of the
late 1800s. Orville and Wilbur experimented with lightweight tubing
that eventually made their airplane design possible. Glen Curtis
worked on bicycles and applied motors to them before he
concentrated on aircraft engine design.
   If one looks into the past, he may find some hints to the
bicycle's future.
   In its heyday, the bike was personalized, individual
transportation. ``It didn't have the upkeep of a horse or the
expense of a carriage,'' Zahradnik says. ``If the roads got bad,
you could pick it up and carry it. It was one of the fastest,
easiest, simplest forms of transportation.''
   And it built roads. It was the complaints of bicyclists in
Washington and state capitals that led to the first modern surge of
road-building. It paved the way for the automobile.
   But, oddly, it wasn't the car that led to the fall of the
bicycle. It was public transportation, steam-powered locomotives
and the electric trolley, which were felled in turn by the car.
   In the late 1800s, a good bike cost about $100, which was
expensive in days when the average income was $8 a week. Today some
are as cheap as $100 or as expensive as $3,000. The United States
makes about 5 million bikes a year and imports another 5 million.
   Americans, however, remain in love with their cars.
   In China, where one person in every 74,000 owns an automobile,
one in four owns a bike. In one study in the northern industrial
city of Tianjin, monitors counted 50,000 bicycles passing one
intersection in an hour.
   Bicycle ownership does not mean bicycle use. Forty-one million
American bikes are owned by children.
   In Britain, one out of every four people owns a bike, yet only
one out of every 33 transport trips are made by bike.
   Writes Worldwatch Institute's Lowe:
   ``The United States has seven times as many bicycles per person
as India, but because one out of every two Americans owns an
automobile _ compared with one out of 500 Indians _ bicycles play a
much more modest role in the U.S. transportation system.''
   The Chinese phenomenon began when the last emperor, Pu Yi, began
pedaling around the Forbidden City in the early 1900s. Today,
China's annual bike sales exceed 40 million.
   ``The rest of the developing world lags far behind in bicycle
transportation,'' says the Worldwatch report. ``In much of Africa
and even more widely in Latin America, the prestige and power of
auto ownership has made governments ignore pedal power and led
citizens to scorn the bicycle as a vehicle for the poor.''
   Oddly, the cost of fuel for Latin American and African cars
contributes to their national debt and their trade deficits. There
are exceptions. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, the city's
largest bakery replaced most of its trucks with 900 delivery trikes
to supply 60,000 neighborhood shops.
