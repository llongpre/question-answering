<LEADPARA>  When sixth-grader Christian Deck rides his bike to Fremont's Gomes School, he
wears his helmet -- even though it brings taunts from his peers.;   "When we
were in fourth grade, all the sixth-graders called us 'helmet heads.'
Christian recalled. "We didn't say anything or they'd beat us up."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But classmate Kyla Sabo, who travels about a half mile to Gomes each day on
her 21-speed mountain bike, said wearing a helmet just isn't worth the
hassle.;   "It's such a short ride," she said. "And when you get to school,
there's nowhere to put your helmet.";   Common attitude; Kyla's sentiments
were most common among Gomes School students, according to a recent survey by
third-grade teacher Karen Wischnack. She polled all 551 Gomes students asking
about their bicycle safety habits and found that 94 percent own bicycles, more
than half have been injured while riding their bikes and most think it's
important to wear helmets. Yet only 17 percent do.;   That may not be many,
but it's better than the national average.;   Statistics kept by the National
Safe Kids Campaign in Washington, D.C., show just 5 percent of children under
15 wear bicycle helmets. They also show that more than 350,000 children are
injured each year in bicycle accidents, 350 are killed in collisions with
motor vehicles -- and helmets can prevent 90 percent of all brain injuries.;  
Head injuries; "It's really alarming, not just kids who are tragically killed
but those who get head injuries from bike accidents," Wischnack said. "It
causes learning disabilities. You see it all the time. The students know it's
important to wear helmets, now it's important for us to give them information
about it.";   And so Wischnack is starting a bike safety campaign at Gomes.
Each teacher will discuss the survey in class. At a recent "back-to-school"
night at Gomes, Wischnack distributed copies of her survey to parents, and it
inspired at least one father to buy his son a helmet.;   Wischnack is also
arranging to have representatives from the Fremont Police Department speak in
the classes on how to prevent bike accidents. And the students will watch a
video tape describing bicycle safety rules. Next spring, Wischnack will repeat
the survey to see whether more children heed the helmet advice.;   But so far,
most children still ride with the wind in their hair, as was evidenced during
the mass exodus at the Gomes bike rack after school one recent day. The
children gave several reasons why they won't wear the protective head gear.;  
Most said the clunky plastic hats ruin their appearance. Many said they don't
own one. Others said helmets are too warm, impair their hearing, or are
unnecessary because, legally, they're not required.;   "They look ugly and
it's not the law," said sixth-grader Troy Bilodeau, who rides his one-speed
bike to school each day. "It's not dangerous if you're not riding on a busy
street like Mission Boulevard.";   He once fell off his bike and fractured his
wrist, but he said a helmet wouldn't have helped in that case.;   Marla Lane,
who also rides her bike to school, agreed the hats aren't good for
appearances: "It messes up your hair," she said. "And by the time you get to
school, your head is all sweaty and everything.";   Sixth-grader Eric Aspell
said wearing a helmet simply isn't in vogue. "It makes you look like a
retard," he said.;   Others wear them in spite of peer pressure and messes of
the tresses.;   "My parents make me wear it," sixth-grader Greg Hom said. "I
guess it's a good idea. It keeps my head safe.";   Classmate Anonck Giovanola
wears a helmet even though it's uncomfortable over her pony tail. "Kids think
they don't look good," Anonck said. "But they don't realize there's nothing
wrong with it. They even make some kinds of helmets that look good."; Bicycle
safety survey; Fremont teacher Karen Wischnak surveyed 551 Gomes Elementary
School students, from kindergarten to sixth grade, about bicycle safety and
use of helmets. Here are the results.; (box)94 percent of the children ride a
bicycle.; (box)61 percent have been injured while riding a bicycle.; (box)9
percent have been in a bicycle accident involving an automobile.; (box)79
percent said it is important to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle.; (box)17
percent actually wear a helmet while riding a bicycle.; (box)27 percent said
the reason they would not wear a helmet is because they dislike the
appearance. Other reasons given for not wearing a helmet were too varied to
tally.; Source: Karen Wischnak survey  </TEXT>
