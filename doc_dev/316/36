<LEADPARA>  Almost every week Sharon and Bo Bautista drive to Coyote Hills Regional Park
in Fremont, put their 2-year-old son Joshua in a three-wheel jogging cart and
prepare to face the danger lurking along the park's trails.;    As they jog
along, it's not a trailside killer they fear. It's bicycles. Dozens of them.
Sometimes hundreds. They appear with little or no warning, swishing silently
around blind curves along the Bayview Trail or zipping haphazardly off one of
the hill paths.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While most bicycle riders follow the rules of the road and watch for
joggers, hikers and each other, many do not. The latter worry the Bautistas.; 
  "When we turn a bend, I always go first to make sure it is safe," Bo
Bautista said. "Sometimes the bicycles come off the hills so fast you don't
see or hear them coming," Sharon Bautista added.;    At Coyote Hills this
year, 14 bicycle accidents have been serious enough to report. Last year there
were 16, with 23 the year before.;    The problem is not unique to Coyote
Hills.;    Nationwide last year, 580,119 people were treated in hospital
emergency rooms after bicycle accidents, according to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission. Bicycle accidents rank third among causes of injuries after
stairway and step accidents (998,906) and basketball accidents (640,755).;   
Serious bicycle accidents involving adults are increasing. The Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety said 43 percent of the 821 bike-related deaths
reported in 1989 involved riders 21 years and older; in 1980, the adult group
accounted for 31 percent of fatalities. The number of adults who ride bikes at
least once a week has doubled in the past five years -- from 12 million to 25
million in 1990, said the Bicycle Institute of America.;    Burgeoning bike
use;    Many accidents involve the increasingly popular mountain bike, the
kind most often seen at Coyote Hills. More than 5 million of the 10 million
bikes sold last year were mountain bikes; the figure is expected to rise to
more than 6 million this year, the Bicycle Institute said.;    These numbers
translate into problems in parks.;    Santa Clara County parks and recreation
director Doug Gaynor said he believes his department has found the answer to
safer park bicycling.;    Gaynor said bicycles were banned from county parks
until last year, when more than 100 miles of trails were opened to the public.
After a two-year study, Gaynor said, bike paths were laid out with safety in
mind, eliminating such things as blind curves, for example.;    In addition,
Gaynor said 100 uniformed volunteers carrying two-way radios on horseback and
on bicycles augment regular law enforcement officers and park rangers. So far
this year, there have been only 15 accidents in all of the county's parks,
about as many as in Coyote Hills alone.;    No park monitors;    East Bay
parks do not have monitors. And Coyote Hills has numerous blind curves.;   
Ken Curtner, a Coyote Hills park aide, said the increasing number of bicycles
on park trails "in my own opinion is a serious problem and getting worse.";   
Norm Kidder, Coyote Hills supervisor, acknowledges that officials are
monitoring the trend.;    "We are a major bike riding park, and the number of
accidents is going up," he said. "People skid out. One fellow went off the
trail because he was looking at the scenery. We've had bikes run into each
other.";    Cyclists at Coyote Hills have 3.5 miles of paved bikeways
connecting with 12 miles of trail along Alameda Creek. They can use fire and
service roads, but are barred from the narrow hiking, equestrian and wooden
marsh trails.;    Louis Roehrs, a cyclist from Fremont, said he is
safety-conscious. "I slow down at the curves and tell people I come across
that I am passing on their left." He said he has never had an accident, but
has seen some.;    Scofflaws face fines;    Kidder said most accidents occur
when someone breaks the rules -- speeding, riding off the designated trails or
just not paying attention. He said East Bay Regional Park District police have
a speed gun and use it to nab bicyclists exceeding the 15 mph speed limit.
They face a fine of up to $230.;    Ned MacKay, district spokesman, said park
police and rangers are cracking down on scofflaw bicyclists, "but we can't be
everywhere."  </TEXT>
