<LEADPARA>  IT SEEMED like a good idea at the time. Mountain bikes were fairly new -- this
was in 1985-- but very cool, and a great way to experience the wilderness.;   
I decided I wanted one.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A male friend went with me to buy my first mountain bike. I had no idea
what I was looking for. I didn't know about gearing, or what size frame, or
where the pump was supposed to go, much less anything about components. What
kind of brakes did you say?;    I test rode several and bought the green one
because I liked the color.;    My friend loaded our bikes in the car and took
me to the woods. I got on my shiny new bike and started riding. Luckily, it
was an easy, flat fire road. We rode a couple of miles, enjoying the peace and
stillness, up to where a stream crossed the road.;    My friend cruised right
through, whooping it up. I stopped. "Ride through that?" I thought. "That's
moving water.";    He rode through several more times, the grin on his face
growing. He did seem to be having fun. So I took a deep breath and did it, and
by the time I reached the other side, I had that same goofy grin.;    I was
going to be a mountain biker!;    My bike didn't see dirt again for months. I
had plenty of great excuses: my friend moved, no one else I knew rode, I
didn't know where to go, I didn't know how, I couldn't do repairs in case
something happened, I didn't want to go alone, I was out of shape, I didn't
have the time.;    Sound familiar?;    There I was. I had a bike and helmet, I
loved being outside and I had ridden off-road once.;    What's a gal to do? I
got a job in a store that sold bikes (I worked in the clothing department).
Lots of mountain bikers worked there, they knew where to ride and how to do
repairs. And they were all men.;    Months later, I got up the nerve to ask
one if he would teach me how to ride, then tried to talk him out of it -- I
was a wimp, I wouldn't be able to go fast, I wouldn't be as much fun as his
friends.;    Even with all my comments, he was willing. Now I actually had to
do it.;    This time I discovered a key word in the sport's name -- mountain.
The trail wasn't flat this time and I had to learn to go uphill and downhill.
My co-worker showed me how to use the gears and how to stand up on the pedals.
He told me places to go, and I started learning how to work my bike. Now I
really was a mountain biker.;    These days, I ride slow, I'm always the last
one, I stop a lot to look at what's around me, I don't charge down the hills
like I used to (a few big crashes convinced me), I often ride alone, I know
where to ride and I've taught others.;    So what's the point of this
chronicle of how I became a mountain biker? It's to show you gals that
mountain biking is whatever you want it to be.;    The secret is to find your
own pace and style, and to let that be enough.;    Learning a new sport at any
age is a humbling experience. You'll probably walk some, you might crash, you
may also see places you never thought you would.;    In my next column, I'll
talk about what a woman buying a mountain bike should look for.  </TEXT>
