<LEADPARA>  BICYCLISTS FOUGHT FOR the right to use streets and roads, and once they won,
whoa, along came the skateboarders. And the roller skaters. And the
Rollerbladers. And a new caste system.;    Bicyclists were earnest and
responsible. They wore helmets and shirts of many colors. They signaled when
they turned, watched out for cars, and attended planning commission meetings
even when no neighbor wanted to build a monster house. They recoiled at the
prospect of sharing their pristine lanes with the ragtag collections of
teen-age punks, aging hippies and New Agers who ride the small-wheeled
vehicles. How could these upstarts be allowed in the street? They had no
lights, no brakes, no couth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Motorists might be excused for wool-gathering when it came to
distinguishing among these other folks. Motorists believed in the bumper
sticker that read, "As a matter of fact, I do own the whole damn road."
Motorists hugged the road the correct way, with Goodyear tires on mag rims,
not with aero disks and sewn-up tubular tires, not with 2-inch plastic wheels.
Motorists were alert for 16-wheel trucks, not for two-wheeled wisps.;    When
bicyclists began to confront this attitude in the 1960s and 1970s they ran
into restrictions that varied from city to city. Some cities were
accommodating -- Davis, Los Altos and Palo Alto among them. Others weren't,
and it wasn't until 1977 that bicyclists got written into state law their
right to use almost all roads. The patchwork persists; while Palo Alto has
traffic signal sensors that a bicycle's weight will trigger, other cities
force cyclists to wait forever or risk getting creamed.;    The status of
Rollerbladers and skaters is still local option. Palo Alto voted in 1989 to
permit skateboarders on most residential streets (with 12-year council veteran
Ellen Fletcher, a staunch bicyclist, among those voting no), while in San Jose
they're considered pedestrians.;    Well, this is another wrinkle to be ironed
out, along with the problem of bicyclists who ride like they're in the Tour de
France -- Le boulevard, c'est moi! -- instead of sharing a mountain road with
cars.;    Road manners haven't caught up, and the law is even farther behind,
but California is the right therapy. Roads are the stage for expressions of a
lifestyle, if not a life -- the car you drive, the bike you ride, your
skateboard, your Rollerblades, your baby jogger.;    How else can you explain
the Hells Angels bicycle messengers in San Francisco, or the crazies who ride
their skateboards down L.A.'s Topanga Canyon Boulevard at brain-damaged
speeds?;    Oh, if we can only learn to get along on the road, we can learn to
get along anywhere (so long as everyone stays in the right lane). Meanwhile,
let cyclist, skateboarder and Rollerblader beware. You don't know whether the
driver next to you is hip to the New Age or hopped up on testosterone.  </TEXT>
