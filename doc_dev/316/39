<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 165;    PERSONAL: Single, lives in Sunnyvale;    OCCUPATION:
Unemployed. He's a computer consultant whose contract with Ford Aerospace in
San Jose ended in December.;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: Bicycling has been
Jackson's main form of exercise for quite a while, he says, because it takes
care of a combination of concerns. "I do it for fun and fitness, and it's good
for the environment." For the past 15 years, five of the 10 bicycles he owns,
along with mass transportation, have served as his sources of mobility. He
sold his car four years ago because he hadn't driven it for so long.;   
REGIMEN: When his job ended, so did his 30-mile round-trip bicycle ride to
work. But Jackson says that using his bike for job hunting, errands and
shopping trips during the week have replaced some of those former commute
miles.;    At least one day on the weekend, "and two days if I'm lucky,"
Jackson gets an "enormous" workout riding his mountain bike 30 to 35 miles
along trails in the hills. "That distance doesn't sound like much to people
who do road riding, but those are really tough miles." He leads long-distance
road rides for the Skyline Cycling Club, but his preference, he says, is
off-road bicycling. "Up in the hills you're away from the streets, traffic and
smog and the scenery passes by at a perfect pace.";    RESULTS: Although he
says he's not in great condition, he's in better shape than the average
person. When he rides with groups, "I am in the company of people who
constantly humble me. I console myself by knowing that, if I wasn't cycling, I
could look a whole lot worse!";    GOALS: "I can't change the world, but using
my bike allows me to make a small contribution toward making it more
environmentally sound." And everyone could, he says, "with a little better
planning.";    OBSTACLES: Lack of expertise and consideration toward
bicyclists on the part of county planning departments, inconsiderate
motorists, auto exhaust and rain gear, which is cumbersome.;    TIPS AND
COMMENTS: People seem to have blind spots when it comes to considering
alternate transportation, he says. "Those who prefer to find excuses for using
their cars have usually never even looked at a bus schedule," he says.;   
When co-workers used to tease him, occasionally, about riding to work, they'd
say, "Wow, you rode your bike today? That's weird." Jackson's reply was, "
'Wow, you drove your car today? How common.' "  </TEXT>
