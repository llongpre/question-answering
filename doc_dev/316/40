<HEAD>Study Finds Bike Helmets Reduce Head Injury Risk 85 Percent</HEAD>

   Bicycle helmets are so effective at preventing
head injuries that a major campaign should be launched to encourage
riders to wear them, a study published today concludes.
   Although many people have long assumed that helmets are an
important part of bike safety, there has been little scientific
data to back this up. Now, a study has shown that riders with
helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury
and an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain damage.
   Yet despite their value, the report found, children who are
involved in bicycling accidents rarely wear them.
   ``Safety helmets are effective, but they are not being used
enough,'' the researchers wrote. ``The time has come for a major
campaign to increase their use.''
   They said that stated another way, their results suggest that
people who ride without helmets are seven times more likely to
suffer head injuries and eight times more likely to get brain
injuries than riders who do.
   The report, based on injuries treated at five Seattle area
hospitals over a one-year period, was directed by Dr. Robert S.
Thompson of the Group Health Cooperative in Seattle. It was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   They noted that in 1985, bicycle injuries accounted for an
estimated 574,000 emergency room visits and 1,300 deaths in the
United States. The most common cause of death and serious
disability in biking accidents is head injury.
   Among the findings:
   _Sixty-eight percent of the severe brain injuries occurred in
children under age 15.
   _Only 4 percent of those with brain injuries were wearing
helmets.
   _Of the children under age 15 who were involved in biking
accidents, 4 percent wore helmets.
   _Use of helmets increased substantially in those over age 25.
   ``Physicians are not always aware of the importance of helmets,
and they are seldom part of health education efforts,'' the
researchers wrote. ``These factors certainly contribute to their
lack of widespread use.''
   The study was based on 235 people who suffered head injuries
while bicycling. They were compared with 433 people who received
emergency care for other biking-related accidents and 558 members
of a health maintenance organization who said they had been
involved in biking mishaps.
   In an accompanying editorial, Daniel Callahan, head of the
Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said bicylists should
wear helmets. But he opposed making them mandatory.
   ``In general,'' he wrote, ``we should resist but not totally
oppose the use of the coercive power of the state to force us to
behave in a healthful way.''
   On May 15, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and
the National Highway Safety Administration announced plans to
improve bicycle safety, including increasing the use of helmets.
   The agencies said they will seek to coordinate local and
national efforts to increase public understanding of bicycle safety
requirements. And the commission is testing available helmets
designed for bicycle riders for effectiveness.
