   Except for one thing, Deeanne Eggleston is a
lot like hundreds of other adventurous bicyclists planning to ride
across the country this summer.
   The difference is that Eggleston is legally blind.
   The ride is her attempt to prove to others _ and maybe to herself
_ that people with disabilities should pursue their dreams despite
risks.
   For her, that means ``putting my life on the line'' in order to
feel more alive.
   ``I've been called really stupid for doing this. People ask why I
feel I have to do it,'' says the soft-spoken 38-year-old. ``But I
think that's what life is. I can't just be sitting around.''
   She leaves April 1, and hopes to arrive in Washington D.C. by
late July.
   ``I see this as a project about the preconceived ideas and
beliefs about people who are different,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her home in Novato, about 30 miles north of San
Francisco.
   Eggleston will be accompanied by a sighted companion, and they'll
communicate through two-way helmet radios. A support car will follow.
   The planned route rolls down the Pacific Coast to Los Angeles,
then across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee and
Virginia.
   Along the way, she plans to meet with civic leaders, speak to
Rotary groups, compare notes with other disabled people and, she
hopes, create a lasting impression of what the disabled can do.
   Before she lost her sight a decade ago, Eggleston, a diabetic,
was an athletic graduate student and amateur photographer.
   First the disease took away the feeling in her feet. Then, just
as she was completing requirements for a masters degree in
psychotherapy, she started losing her sight. She now has only 6
percent vision in one eye _ just enough to distinguish fuzzy shadows
from light.
   ``I always had a dream of riding a bicycle across the U.S. and a
dream of taking pictures of people across the United States. But
with school and my career, there was never time,'' she said.
   Her blindness prompted her to ``question the way I'd been looking
at the world.''
   She first resumed her interest in portrait photography. Using the
little sight she has, she frames her subject in the viewfinder. But
the photos are intentionally out of focus. The idea is to show her
perception of the world.
   ``If I have a perfectly focused picture, it's an accident,'' she
said, boasting that ``many, many famous portrait photographers say I
capture things that others can't.''
   Cycling is a greater challenge. She can't feel the pedals with
her feet. She can't see curbs or potholes.
   She first prepared herself for months by lifting weights and
practicing on a stationary bike. When she was ready to try riding a
bicycle last December, friends helped her get one in San Francisco.
But she waited until after they were gone to get on it.
   Then she took the mountain bike with 1.9-inch balloon tires, onto
the wide, smooth driveway outside her condominium.
   ``I spent about 20 minutes just straddling it before I had the
nerve to actually put my feet on the pedals and start moving,'' she
said recalling how frightened she was.
   Finally, she decided to ride in a big circle. Off she went,
repeating the round path until she realized she was near a curb. She
turned to miss it, but almost hit a garage. ``And then my fear was
real.''
   Since then, she says ``it's just been a continuous building up of
confidence.''
   She listens carefully for the sound of oncoming traffic. She
makes the most of what sight she has.
   She learned Wednesday that the woman who will start the trip with
her will be able to go only as far as Dallas. But she is confident
she'll be able to find someone to ride with her from there, or will
somehow find the nerve to go it alone.
   ``If we have to end it in Dallas, there'll be some disappointment
in that,'' she said Thursday. ``But to say I went across the country
on a bicycle really is not what my goal has ever been.''
   Eggleston extended her training routes gradually to the point
where she now rides between 20 and 45 miles a day by herself on the
quiet roads around her home.
   ``One day I was heading down a hill, and I was picking up speed
and I was very afraid. Suddenly, I raised my head and felt the wind
in my face. And I felt like I was kissing the wind.''
