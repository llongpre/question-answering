<LEADPARA>  EACH of our two unreliable Fords has 80,000 miles. Both in our 30s, we
realized the daily trek to the driveway was hardly enough exercise to keep us
even semi-svelte. And, as former city dwellers, we were curious if South Bay
mass transit really deserved its bum rap.;    That's why we decided to try
getting around using only the bus, light rail, CalTrain, bikes and our own two
feet for seven days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the outset, we really had no idea if local mass transit was the costly,
inefficient monster most of us auto addicts like to believe or if it could
become a part of our daily routine. (Not that we needed war in the Persian
Gulf to drive the point home -- nonetheless it is a terrifying reminder of our
dependence on gas-guzzling autos.);    Now before we sound too self-righteous,
we'll make two confessions: We hopped in a cab one night because we missed the
last bus, and we figured it wouldn't be much of a sacrifice to live auto-free
for a week.;    We don't have kids living with us and both our commutes
combined are only a meager (by Bay Area standards) 24 miles a day. Everything
we associate with survival -- the dry cleaners, 7-Eleven, video rental store
and automatic teller machine -- are within a 10-minute walk. The bus stop is
only 135 steps from our East San Jose home, even fewer if our quickly trained
ears picked up the roar of a bus engine approaching.;    And we were a bit
cocky, having survived New York subways for four and a half years -- with just
one chain snatching to report.;    But this story is about much more than mass
transit. It's about reassessing priorities, striking up new, unusual
relationships and finding out about the place we call home.;    We made all
the mistakes worthy of any novice bus rider, including misreading schedules
and taking a route recommended by a Santa Clara County Transit schedule
adviser. (She forgot to tell us that every driver on the route that stops
closest to our house takes a mandated 20-minute break just a mile down the
road.);    The result: On the first day, a trip that is usually 12 minutes by
car turned into a one-hour-and-43-minute ride. One of us was 45 minutes late
to work, the other missed an hour of class.;    But then, with the invaluable
help of Aristeo Canales, who answered our distress call to county transit's
hot line -- the bus rider's version of 911 -- the time was reduced to an
almost remarkable 45 minutes. On an average weekday, Canales and his
colleagues answer some 3,400 calls.;    By the third day, with hot-line number
committed to memory, riding the bus became second nature. We kept a roll of
quarters by the phone. Bus routes 71, 36 and 59 became as recognizable as
highways 101, 880 and 280.;    Mass-transit myths;  Besides daily trips to the
Mercury News and Evergreen Valley College, we used the bus to go to Valley
Fair and Eastridge malls and to a friend's house in Santa Clara to watch a
sporting event on TV (we almost missed the game's exciting end as we had to
catch the bus home). We rode light rail to the San Jose Real Estate Board
dinner-dance at the Red Lion Hotel (that's when we cheated with the cab
because our bus stopped running at 7:30 p.m. on Saturdays), and took CalTrain
to Sunday brunch at MacArthur Park in Palo Alto.;    Sure, spending a week on
buses and trains reinforced some old stereotypes about mass transit. But many
myths were dashed.;    Yes, the buses are slow and noisy, but at least it's
not your blood pressure that rises when a jerk swerves through traffic.;   
Yes, many buses come only once every 45 minutes to an hour. Quickly, you
develop a dependency on the minute hand of your watch.;    Yes, one of us was
left standing at a stop for 45 minutes because a bus broke down, something
that as the county transit's fleet ages apparently is happening with more
regularity. (Personally speaking, however, we can hardly crow about our 1982
Mustang's record.);    No, the buses do not always run behind schedule -- in
fact, sometimes they are early (which can be worse than running late if they
don't wait).;    No, the bus drivers are not all clones of Ralph Kramden. They
wish you good night, help passengers with grocery bags and, in one case, gave
impromptu English lessons to a Spanish-speaking regular passenger.;    40
seats, no standing;  Mass, we found out however, is a misnomer. It's not
uncommon to share a 40-seat bus or a light-rail car with just one or two
others. (We find it hard to believe Santa Clara County Transit, which says
144,000 people, or 10 percent of the county's population, ride the bus
weekdays.);    Some of us are forever addicted to the fast lane, but life on
mass transit has its rewards, too.;    After spending more than two years
looking at San Jose mostly through a car windshield, sitting with strangers
fosters a sense of community and allows conversations you'd ordinarily never
have -- a neighborhood deli on wheels, if you will.;    We had conversations
with strangers about Middle East goings-on and learned how to listen to (or at
least tolerate) rap music. We even made a new friend, a 24-year-old
engineering student from Mexico who is here to learn English -- and willing to
help us with our halting Spanish.;    Instead of blaring the all-news station
on the car radio, it's refreshing to become engrossed in a book or just
daydream out the window (as long as one remembers to get off at the right stop
-- another mistake made early on.);    Just walking to and from the bus (a
healthy two miles, counting both ends), we came to recognize
interesting-looking people and scenery we'd previously whizzed by.;    Not to
digress, but walking is an important part of the mass-transit experience
around here. Walkers, at least in our little patch of suburbia, are treated as
second-class citizens -- even though they rightly can claim endangered-species
status.;    Bushes and cars routinely block sidewalks. One can barely pass a
house without riling cats and dogs -- and then their owners who rush outside
-- or setting off motion-detecting lights that diligently guard driveways at
night. Since when are sidewalks private property?;    Rolling stops by
inattentive drivers are life-threatening, and those yellow-tinted streetlights
are positively useless.;    Nevertheless, both of us not only survived but
also came to enjoy the regimen.;    And not a moment too soon, as the quest to
make mass transit compatible with all of our lives will take on more urgency.
Bay Area planners say that to coax people out of their cars in order to meet
federal air-quality standards, by the 21st century we can expect to pay to
park at work and shell out $5 for bridge tolls.;    With gas hitting $1.40 a
gallon at times over the last few months, spending $1.50 a day for unlimited
travel on Santa Clara County Transit buses and light rail makes economic
sense.;    Our verdict after the one-week trial is that mass transit, with
perseverance and patience, is feasible. Not every day or every place.;    But
here's a challenge. Take mass transit or walk or bike somewhere you usually
drive, just one time each week.;    You might be surprised. You might like it.  </TEXT>
