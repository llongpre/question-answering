<LEADPARA>  TOM HALE came late to bicycling. But he's made up for it in spades.;    The
38-year-old owner of the country's largest bicycle travel company -- Backroads
Bicycle Touring -- didn't even start riding a bike until he was 12 years old.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I guess you could say I was a late starter," said Hale, who ran track on a
scholarship at the University of Oregon.;    His Berkeley-based company will
escort an estimated 7,500 people this year on cycling jaunts from the Napa
Valley wine country to Yellowstone to New England to Bali. The firm has 100
employees and sales will approach $8 million this year.;    Like thousands of
other students, Hale commuted to and from campus while attending college and
then at graduate school at UCLA.;    He continued his riding habits when he
took a job as an environmental planner in Las Vegas, even though he remembers
being one of the few people in that city of neon and glitter who rode a
bicycle.;    Hale and his first calling didn't mesh well, and he soon began
plotting his escape. One night, about six months into his first job, the
Orinda native woke up at 2 a.m. and began writing out what became an
eight-page business plan for his company. He still has those eight pages.;   
"I didn't know where or exactly how I'd do it, but I knew it was what I wanted
to do and that there had to be a market for people who wanted to travel at a
slower pace and see things from the seat of a bicycle," said Hale.;    He quit
his office job after 10 months and took off for a 5,000-mile bike tour around
the West. He ended up in the Bay Area and has stayed -- except when he's off
in far-flung corners of the country or globe looking for new cycling
territory.;    "Northern California seemed like the right place because of the
weather, the athletic bent of the people and the overall population base,"
said Hale. His most popular trips are still the ones that are closest to home
-- the wine country of the Napa, Sonoma and Alexander valleys.;    That first
year, Hale ran Backroads Bicycling out of a basement and a garage in a big
house in Oakland he rented with six other people. In addition to the wine
country, he also offered trips to Death Valley, Bryce and Zion national parks,
the Grand Canyon, Glacier National Park, the Tetons, Puget Sound and the
Canadian Rockies.;    All totaled, he had about 100 clients that initial
season. His seed money of $12,000 soon was gone, so six months later, he
invested another $15,000 to keep things going.;    "The bookings started
growing steadily, but it took at least five years before the company became
profitable," said Hale, who worked other jobs the first few years to stay
afloat.;    Slowly but surely, the word began to get passed around about the
enjoyable catered-cycling trips that Backroads offered, Hale said.;   
"Word-of-mouth has been the key to our success. Many people would like to go
on a bicycle tour, but they don't have the time to organize one and they'd
rather not carry 50-plus pounds of gear on their bikes. So we do that for
them," said Hale. His company plans the trips, provides the leaders, drives
the "sag" wagons and also prepares great lunches along the road.;    "We also
give adventuresome people the opportunity to ride with like-minded folks.
People tell us it's companionship that often is as important as the ride.
We've had a number of people who've met their future spouses on our trips," he
said, chuckling.;    More than 40 percent of Backroads' business is return
customers. Many of them would like to become trip leaders. For Backroads' 55
openings in 1991, Hale said he had a whopping 1,600 applications.;    Hale can
ride just about wherever in the world he pleases. He swears he doesn't have a
favorite bicycle trip.;    "It all depends on what you want. You can't compare
riding in Northern Italy, staying at fine villas and drinking espresso in
little cafes. But cycling in the Grand Canyon and camping there is also
wonderful in its own way. Bali is exotic and New England inns during the fall
are also great," he said.;    Though most of Backroads' clientele is in the
30-to-40 range, Hale said he has had toddlers (towed by parents), teens and
cyclers in their 60s and 70s come on trips.;    He said the split between inn
and camping trips is 75-25, though the interest in camping has started to rise
in the past year or so.;    As for the inns, customers have asked for nicer
accommodations, so that the nicest inn of 10 years ago is probably the least
luxurious now, he said. Shared baths are also becoming a thing of the past --
also because of customer requests.;    Hale said he has been on about a trip a
month -- doing "research" -- since January.;    "I'd have to say I'm a pretty
lucky guy. And I really like the business side of running the company, too,"
said Hale. "I've loved getting up and going to work just about every morning
for the past 12 years. You can hardly beat that.";  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For
