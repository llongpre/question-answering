<LEADPARA>  ACCORDING TO a recent report by Bicycling magazine, half of all car trips made
in the United States are five miles or less -- a distance that easily can be
covered on a bicycle.;    But only 2 to 3 percent of the population commutes
by bicycle.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Bicycling survey, a nationwide Harris Poll, indicates that one in 60
adults sometimes commutes by bicycle, but that one in five adults would ride
to work if safe bike lanes were available and if employers offered incentives
for commuting. Twenty-one percent said they would ride to work if secure
parking and showers were available at their workplace.;    If 25 percent of
adults rode just five miles a week, the report says, the annual national
gasoline bill would drop by $1.2 billion, because riding a bike costs just 5
cents per mile, compared to 35 cents per mile for automobiles. In fact, a
Dutch study shows that a person who uses a bike for all trips of 3 miles or
less will save $400 a year in fuel expenses.  </TEXT>
