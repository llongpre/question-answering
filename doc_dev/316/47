   Bicyclists spent years training
motorists to share the road in this two-wheeler town, but now they
must make room for a brash new four-wheeled rival: the skateboard.
   The Palo Alto City Council recently approved an ordinance
authorizing skateboards on all but 25 of the city's busiest streets.
   To cyclists who fought for years to develop 45 miles of bicycle
paths, the new law smacks of dashed promises and perilous road
hazards.
   Bicycling has taken on major cultural significance in Palo Alto,
where city employees are reimbursed seven cents per mile for riding
their bikes to work and some corporations provide showers and even
free towels for cycling employees.
   The police department even offers a bicycle traffic school for
juveniles.
   Cyclists reject accusations they're reluctant to share the road
with skateboarders and point instead to their brakes, lights and
reflectors, claiming to be the superior mode of alternative transit
in this affluent, highly-educated community.
   But skateboarders say they know better.
   ``They think they're cars,'' Bobby Angus, 13, of Menlo Park,
said of bicyclists.
   ``They could get out of our way, but no. We have to get out of
their way,'' said 14-year-old Justin Aranda.
   ``People think we want to knock over old ladies, and it's not
true,'' said 14-year-old Mark Nelson of Menlo Park, straddling his
bicycle. ``I stop faster on my board than on my bike. Biking's sort
of lame.''
   Walter Williams, 14, dropped his board to the ground to
demonstrate a ``power slide'' stop, in which sharp, mid-air
maneuvering brought the board to an abrupt halt.
   Many cities simply prohibit skateboard riding.
   In San Francisco, 35 miles north of Palo Alto, skateboarding is
illegal on all roadways and the sidewalks of any business district,
and has been since 1976.
   In Sacramento, police recently painted skateboards next to the
graphics of bicycles and roller skates, both indicating vehicles
already prohibited on pathways in Capitol Park.
   Even the city of Petaluma, about 60 miles north of Palo Alto,
which modified its laws in 1987 to allow skateboarders to use
public streets, still bans skateboarding in shopping centers, on
sidewalks, in parks and after dark without reflectors.
   But in Palo Alto, city councilman Leland Levy has hailed the
skateboard as a ``terrific mode'' of transportation because it's
``small, easy to deal with and you can carry it around with you.''
   Compared to popular multi-speed bicycles that sell for hundreds
and even thousands of dollars, skateboards are a cheap way to get
around, at $150 each for top-of-the-line equipment, and they are
particularly popular with students.
   But this does little to endear cyclists to skateboarding.
   ``I don't care if they're using it for transportation, but when
they start showing off, they take up the road,'' said Ben Brown,
13, of Menlo Park. ``The ones who get obsessed with it, they're the
ones who get in your way.''
   Skateboarders have a long way to go before they will come close
to matching the number of bicyclists, and unlike bicyclists they so
far have no organization to represent them when lobbying the city.
   Dave Uggla of the Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee, formed
by City Council to advise it on issues relating to bicycles,
likened much of the skateboarders' current struggle for respect to
that of cyclists in the early 1970s.
   ``We had a long, hard fight'' to win community awareness, he
said.
   And Bob Noyes, an avid cyclist who commutes three miles each way
to work, warned of the downside of respectability.
   ``There's a rough side to it, too,'' he said. ``You get moving
violations just like a car. I got two for running stop signs.''
