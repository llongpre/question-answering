   Biking may be one of America's favorite pastimes,
but without precautions, it can result in head injuries, nerve
damage or impotence.
   More than 500,000 people are injured each year in bicycle
accidents, with about 1,000 dying of their injuries, says Dr.
Michael Chapman, chairman of the American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons Committee on Trauma.
   Bicylists have an even higher incidence of severe head injuries
than motorcyclists, and three out of four such injuries result in
death, he notes.
   Accidents cause the most serious bike injuries, but regular
biking also can cause neuropathy _ a malfunction of the nerves,
says Chapman.
   For example, pressure from the cyclist's grip on the handlebars
can result in neuropathy affecting the hands with numbness,
weakness, pain and lack of coordination, while nerve damage in the
groin area from a poorly adjusted or improperly sized seat can lead
to impotence in men.
   Pressure from the bicycle seat also can cause blood in the
urine, inflammation of the urethra, and irritation of the buttocks.
   Bikers can protect themselves from injury with some basics
recommended by Chapman:
   _ Always wear a helmet with a hard shell.
   _ Wear proper clothing. Bright, reflective clothing makes a
rider more visible at night. Padded gloves and handlebars help
protect the hands from chronic pressure injuries.
   _ Wear shoes and socks. Children, especially, like to ride
barefoot, but many sustain broken or crushed bones and bruises when
their feet get caught in the spokes, whether pedalling or riding on
the back of a bike.
   _ Fit the size of the bike to the rider. When the rider
straddles the bike standing there should be one or two inches of
space between the groin and the bike frame. When the rider sits on
the bike and the right pedal is at its lowest position, the right
knee should be flexed about 10 or 15 degrees.
   _ Drink plenty of water. Constant air movement around the
cyclist evaporates sweat, and that can contribute to dehydration.
