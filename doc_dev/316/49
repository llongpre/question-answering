   Come along on a ride on a bicycle built for two,
through a scenic area of Italy that has changed little over the
centuries. It's really the best way to see the countryside and meet
the people, but couch potatoes had best spend a while getting in
shape before setting out on a pedal-power tour.

   Imagine days of gliding through scenes
from Roman antiquity on a bicycle, with midmorning stops for
cappuccino, streamside lunches of fresh-baked bread, cheese,
prosciutto and wine and evenings in luxurious villas.
   Thousands of people, young and old, athlete and couch potato,
are finding travel by bicycle an exhilarating way of really seeing
the countryside, talking to people and finding historic or cultural
locales rarely available to those speeding through on
air-conditioned tour buses.
   Many adventurous souls are setting off on bicycle trips on their
own, loading their two-wheelers with clothing, bedrolls and
necessities. Others are letting a tour company make lodging
arrangements, plan an itinerary, schedule meals and provide a van
to haul luggage.
   Bicycle tours are available through most European countries,
most areas of the United States, Central and South America and even
the Soviet Union and China.
   I and my wife chose one of the most experienced biking and
walking tour operators, Butterfield and Robinson of Toronto, and
rode from near Milan, Italy, to Venice on a bicycle built for two,
a French-made 10-speed tandem. You can ship your own bike or the
tour operator will provide custom-made bicycles.
   The American Bicycle Federation says the number of bicyclers in
this country increased from 78 million to 88 million since 1985.
   It is expected the bicycle craze will spurt again now that
American Greg LeMond has won the prestigious Tour de France.
   Several states hold popular cross-state bicycle tours. One of
the most grueling is the Ride the Rockies tour that this year
covered 361 miles and went over 11,990-foot Loveland Pass. Tour
director Paul Balaguer said 3,500 people applied for the tour,
which is limited to 2,000.
   Our Northern Italy group included 23 Americans _ people from all
walks of life from all parts of the United States. Ages ranged from
about 30 to the 60s. Tour operators said the eldest to date had
been a 78-year-old man.
   Some had done nothing more to train for the trip than their
usual tennis or golf game. They also were a little stiff and sore
the first day or two, but that quickly went away. My wife and I had
bicycled about 30 miles on Saturdays and Sundays for two months
before the tour and found the tour a breeze.
   Bicycle helmets and biking gloves are strongly recommended and
an athletic shoe with a firm sole is a good idea. Otherwise,
clothing is left up to the individual. On the tour, attire ranged
from skin-tight bicycling outfits to shorts, T-shirts and slacks. A
lightweight rain jacket is recommended, for chilly mornings and
afternoon showers.
   Our group gathered in the lobby of a Milan hotel and then it was
off by bus to Sirmione, on a peninsula on the southern shore of
Lake Garda, Italy's largest. At the tip, a modern hydrofoil
passenger boat cruised past the ruins of a Roman spa.
   Idling past sidewalk cafes, coffee shops and tourists, the bus
squeezed through a narrow passageway at a historic castle, then
deposited our group at the steps of Villa Cortine, the first of
several luxurious villas where our palates would be pampered at
multicourse meals and our bodies rested in regal suites.
   Our two guides _ Jennifer, a Toronto lawyer, and Nick, whose
future plans include screenwriting in New York _ showed us our
bicycles and gave us an orientation on safety, including the
required wearing of helmets and a caution against braking hard with
only the front brake (it can throw you over the handlebars).
   They discussed the daily routine: breakfast together and then to
the bicycles, which would be checked and ready. The cyclists were
encouraged to set their own pace and see the sights. Some raced off
each morning on optional side trips that saw them travel up to 50
miles in a day. Others stopped to take photographs, visit with the
natives, enjoy a cappuccino or espresso and purchase postcards,
still completing the average 30 miles a day in time for a swim at
the villa.
