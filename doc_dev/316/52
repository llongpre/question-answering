On a recent winter day, John Tomac rode his mountain bike north on Owensmouth 
Avenue, slicing effortlessly through a bitterly cold head wind that flattened 
his long, blond hair. Ahead were the Santa Susana Mountains, which would 
provide him with shelter -- not only from nature but from man as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac, the 1988 National Off-Road Bicycle Assn.'s overall champion, trains in 
the mountains near his home in Chatsworth. But he also is becoming more 
involved in road racing, which has taken him out of the mountains and onto the 
asphalt. And as any bike rider in Los Angeles knows, the mountains, despite 
their rugged terrain, can be more hospitable than the mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay off Valley surface streets," Tomac, a 21-year-old bachelor, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But that is almost impossible for Tomac, who trains as much as 25 hours a week, 
mostly on streets. "People throw stuff at me," he said. "They get belligerent 
and think I'm taking up too much of the road and try to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he has to duck tire irons. Mostly, it's ice from soft drinks. "A lot 
of people don't understand road racing here in the U. S.," Tomac said. "It's 
not like Europe. If you take a training ride in Europe, people cheer you. Here, 
they throw a Big Gulp." 
</P>
<P>
But drivers who make Tomac a drive-by icing victim should beware: He may catch 
up to you at the next light. Or next county. A member of the U. S. National 
Cycling Team and '88 Criterium national champion, Tomac is capable of sprinting 
40 miles an hour for short distances on flat land. He also can complete 
130-mile mountain races in 6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac trains almost every day and, from March through September, races almost 
every weekend. His favorite road routes take him along Los Angeles Avenue in 
Simi Valley all the way to Port Hueneme, about an 80-mile round-trip. He also 
likes to ride the Sierra Highway into Antelope Valley, despite the constant 
buffeting as cars and trucks whiz past. 
</P>
<P>
"The major problem is traffic," he says. "I can only hope people pay attention 
to what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Riding up Owensmouth, Tomac turned at a light, cut diagonally across Lassen 
Street when the coast was clear and veered onto a bike path that paralleled a 
drainage ditch. Going north again, he hit the chilling wind, but it didn't 
bother him. Off-road racers, who often experience blazing heat and numbing cold 
on the same ride, have to learn to ignore discomfort. Tomac learned early. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in the small Michigan town of Owosso, Tomac started BMX racing when 
he was 7, riding every day, even in winter. By the time he was 16, he was 
national champion in his age group. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac's sister Deana, older by four years, usually drove him to out-of-state 
races. At a race in Florida five years ago, she changed both their lives. 
That's when she met and fell for a pro BMX racer named Robby Rupe. They were 
married a year later and moved to the Valley. Rupe introduced Tomac to mountain 
racing in the winter of 1985, when Tomac was living with them on an extended 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we found out how good he was, we encouraged him to move here 
permanently," said Rupe, who works in the transportation department at The 
Times' Valley plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Rupes' small spare bedroom that Tomac first moved into is now filled with 
riding paraphernalia and medals. There is also a large color photo of Tomac 
winning a race, his face and body caked with mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to have pictures of all the top guys, but pretty soon he was beating 
them," Rupe says, "so he took their pictures down." 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Tomac and Rupe have turned their garage into a private bicycle 
repair shop. About a dozen bikes hang on hooks and a workbench is covered with 
specialized tools. Before he goes for a ride, Tomac feels his tires for 
pressure and adds a few pounds with a hand pump. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac's mountain bike is a Mongoose. It was given to him by his primary sponsor 
-- he also has deals for clothing, tires and sunglasses. Although still 
designated an amateur, Tomac "makes a pretty good living" on his bike. (He has 
won as much as $4,000 in one race. U.S. Cycling Federation rules state that a 
rider can win as much as $2,000 a day and remain an amateur; additional money 
must go into a trust). 
</P>
<P>
Tomac plans to become a pro road racer by 1991, which means he will have to 
move to Europe, where all the major races -- including the Tour de France -- 
take place and top riders can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. To 
prepare for Europe, Tomac has been reducing his involvement in mountain biking. 
Last year, 70% of his races were in the mountains, but only half will be this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac is aware that a career in road racing usually ends when a rider is in his 
early 30s. Although he trained as an electronics technician at Edison Tech in 
Sherman Oaks, Tomac isn't sure what he wants to do when his racing days are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll try to keep it fun," he says.
