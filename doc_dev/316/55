FT  12 AUG 94 / Technology: Riders on a storm - Small shops have fired the
biking revolution

When Christopher Chance began making high-end mountain bikes in Somerville,
Massachusetts, in 1982, he had no idea he would be part of a technology
revolution the likes of which the sector had not seen since the 1800s.
'I loved mountain biking,' he says. 'So I decided to get into the business.
I was aiming for better performance, so I just kept on experimenting with
things, how to get a stronger, lighter bike with better suspension.'
Today, Chance's company, Fat City Cycles, is one of a score of manufacturers
 -including Kona, Specialized, Cannondale, Giant, Trek and Marin - at the
cutting edge of bicycle production. Many, like Chance, started out as small
entrepreneurs fiddling around in sweaty shops. Those small shops, however,
invented new techniques which lit a fire under the industry.
'The amazing technological improvements we've seen over the last 20 years in
bicycles were led by small entrepreneurs looking for ways to improve the
ride,' says William Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine. 'Those little
changes added up to big advances.'
Unlike in Europe, where bicycles have always been used as a mode of
transportation, the US market was mostly limited to children and enthusiasts
until the 1970s, when interest in 'road bikes' - bicycles used on footpaths
 -picked up.
That renewed interest in bicycles turned to fervour in the 1980s, when the
introduction of mass-produced mountain bikes transformed the sector from a
sleepy, old-fashioned market to an industry serving one of the hottest new
sports of the decade. At the end of 1993, there were 100m cyclists in the
US, 33 per cent more than in 1983, according to the Bicycle Federation of
America. Mountain bikes were the overwhelming favourite, comprising about 95
per cent of all bicycle sales in the country last year.
Because mountain bikes are used in more demanding circumstances than road
bikes, there was soon a push for improved technology. Makers derived
inspiration from motorcycles, automobiles, even aeroplanes. Later, the
advances were used in road bikes and the new hybrids, a cross between a
mountain and a road bike.
With the advent of mountain bikes, manufacturers started concentrating on
suspension, since riders have to negotiate rocks and bumps as smoothly as
possible. They borrowed the idea of front and back forks from motorcycles.
Front suspension forks caught on quickly, but full suspension bikes have
presented performance problems. 'It's not like a motorcycle, where you can
just turn up the throttle,' says Chance. 'The bike depends on the rider's
energy, and the early full suspension models required users to put out more
energy to make the bike move.' With so much resistance between themselves
and the tyres, riders found the bicycles tiring, and complained of an
awkward bobbing sensation when pedalling.
The industry has just begun to overcome the problems of full suspension by
making adjustments in braking and chain tension, and by shifting the pivot
point where the suspension attaches to the frame. With many of the wrinkles
ironed out, full suspension bikes are enjoying vastly increased sales.
Another source of impetus for better bicycles is the revived interest in
racing. Like car companies, bicycle manufacturers are hooking up with racers
to market their products and to gain inspiration for technological advances.
'Our racing team rides all over the world in all kinds of weather and on all
types of terrain,' says Thomas Armstrong, head of marketing for Cannondale.
'They give us feedback on the bikes so we can make improvements.'
One of the main concerns in bike racing is obtaining the lightest frame
possible to take competitors speedily to the finish line. The materials used
in racing bikes are usually expensive, but as costs dwindle, they filter
down to the general public.
In the 1980s, for instance, the price of aluminium frames, which are lighter
than steel, dropped substantially, and these were adopted by the mass
market. Now, aluminium is being challenged by titanium, a strong and even
lighter material. Titanium itself may be replaced by exotic materials such
as carbon fibre, beryllium and AerMet, a steel alloy used in the landing
gear of aeroplanes. Manufacturers are also starting to experiment with
thermoplastics.
Anyone who has not been in a bicycle shop in the past few years would today
be amazed, and probably a little confused, at the options in components. A
new disc brake is ideal for downhill riding, because it doesn't heat up as
much as traditional brake pads. Brake pads, too, are being refined in shape
and materials for better braking power.
Grip pedals are also a novelty in the bicycling shops. Based on ski
bindings, the pedals hook into specially designed shoes.
Serious enthusiasts have access to a slew of other products, such as a new
biking shoe which incorporates a system to tighten and loosen tension. And
for a softer saddle, a buyer might opt for a new seat by Selle San Marco,
which contains the state-of-the-art Dupont thermopolymer Hytrel.
New manufacturing technologies are less sexy, but just as important. Fat
City, for instance, uses a method which thins out metal in the middle of the
tube, and adds extra thickness at the ends, which come under the most
stress. The process makes the bicycle lighter and stronger.
The drawback of these technologies is cost. A sophisticated bicycle can cost
Dollars 10,000 or more, beyond the reach of most consumers. Moreover, shop
owners say many consumers purchase far more sophisticated items than they
really need.
'The industry is really getting ahead of itself in the technology area,'
says John Balmer, product manager of Kona in Washington state. 'For the kind
of riding most people do, a lot of these things are just not necessary. I
think there's going to be a re-focus in the industry on durability and
safety features over the next decade, while we absorb some of the
technological advances made in the 1980s.'
