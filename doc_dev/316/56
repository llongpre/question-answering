Duke Ellington, who died on May 24, 1974, would have been 90 this Saturday and 
in memory of his birthday, numerous celebrations are scheduled that day around 
the Southland. KUSC-FM (91.5) interrupts its usual 24-hour classical format to 
present "My Sparkling Parade," a 90-minute audio portrait of the great 
composer-bandleader-pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 6 p.m., the program includes interviews with Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Music Director Andre Previn, composer-author Gunther Schuller and Ellington 
collaborator Maurice Peress. In his interview, Schuller, author of the recently 
published "The Swing Era," places Ellington in the forefront of American 
composers, in the company of Ives, Copland and Gershwin. The show's musical 
examples will be drawn from previously unreleased Ellington symphonic sessions.

<P>
Special live-performance Ellington fetes include the Santa Barbara City College 
Jazz Festival, where "A Birthday Tribute to Duke," featuring trumpeter Jon 
Faddis, pianist Billy Mitchell and others, will be held at the Arlington 
Theatre, 8 p.m.; and "Happy Birthday, Duke," at the Islander Cafe in 
Mid-Wilshire, where singers Tom Briggs and Lisa Nobumoto offer a tribute in 
song. No doubt Ellington tunes will be heard in other nightspots around town.

BOUNCING BACK: Andy Simpkins, the bassist for the last nine years with singer 
Sarah Vaughan and a regular free-lancer in Los Angeles jazz clubs, is back to 
active playing after undergoing a hip replacement in January. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery, Simpkins -- who plays this Friday with the Gerald Wiggins trio 
at the Loa in Santa Monica -- kept playing at home. But he really missed 
getting out to clubs. "That was the worst part of my recuperation." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "playing is great," he said. "Guys tell me the gig's over and I say, 'Hey, 
we just got started.' " Simpkin's new solo LP, "Calamba" (Discovery), is due 
out soon.

COOL CRUISE: The New American Orchestra, the locally based, symphonic jazz 
orchestra, is sponsoring "Rhapsody on Wheels," a fund-raising bike ride along 
the bike paths and beaches of Marina del Rey on May 7, beginning at 10 a.m. For 
a $21 entry fee, riders receive a T-shirt, an LP, a concert at the end of the 
ride and a chance to compete in a contest by identifying musical numbers, 
played by New American Orchestra members at points along the 14-mile course.

***1/2 Bongo-Logic's "Cha-Cha-Charanga" (Rocky Peak) is the recording debut of 
the local salsa/Latin-jazz band. Led by percussionist Brett Gollin and 
featuring flutist Art Webb, violinist Harry Scorzo and pianist John Enrico 
Douglas, the group goes with the spritely "Juguetes," the haunting "Didi's 
Danzon" and a roaring version of Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps to Heaven. . . . 
"In a Jazz Tradition" (EmArcy) finds guitarist Eric Gale heading up a combo -- 
which includes bassist Ron Carter and saxman Houston Person -- where "jazz 
tradition" means "the blues." Gale -- who leans more toward the sparse, telling 
phrasing of a B. B. King than the hard-swinging quality of a Wes Montgomery -- 
injects blues feeling into everything from "Eric's Gale," a medium cooker, to 
Duke Jordan's classic "Jordu" and Tadd Dameron's "If You Could See Me Now."
