<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 150 pounds;   PERSONAL: Married nine years; he has a son, age 19,
and two daughters, ages 13 and 15; and lives in Castro Valley;   OCCUPATION:
Dentist practicing in Castro Valley;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: Although Kvikstad
says he's always felt "athletically inclined," the only sport he participated
in that ever demanded a certain level of conditioning was hockey, which he
played while growing up in Minnesota. Golf was more to his liking and he's
"played a respectable game" since the age of 13.;   The son of parents who
fought heart disease, Kvikstad says he always knew he ought to be getting more
exercise. "I tried low-key jogging in college, but could never stay with it.";
  The need for a regular workout finally hit home when he started experiencing
shortness of breath on the golf course. He was 28 years old, "huffing and
puffing up the small inclines," when he became concerned about his well-being.
"Regular exercise finally became a primary motive in my life.";   Finding a
running partner was a key factor in achieving consistency, he says, "because
you have to show up." They didn't "push it" at first, averaging a mile three
times a week around a track. A year later he started "stretching out" the
distance to four or five miles each time out. When schedule conflicts made it
difficult to coordinate runs with a partner, he went solo. But, by then,
"running had become part of my lifestyle.";   REGIMEN: Kvikstad runs about
four miles three or four times a week -- unless he's training for a special
event. Then it's more. And he chooses at least one every year, to give him a
goal to work toward. During the past 18 years, he has finished more than 30
10Ks, four half-marathons and five marathons.;   Kvikstad's introduction to
bicycling came when he met his wife. Although he found their camping and
cycling vacations enjoyable, his need for a greater challenge on a bike
prevailed. He has ridden the one-day Davis Double 200-mile bike ride, done
hill climbing on the Markleeville Death Ride and, in August, he finished a
bike tour across Oregon.;   He and his wife average 15 cross-country ski trips
each season, and he still plays golf about twice a month.;   RESULTS: "I'm
thin and fit, but there's always room for improvement.";   GOALS:
"Tentatively, to do a triathlon next year, if I can overcome one big obstacle
-- swimming. It's a skill I'd have to learn.";   OBSTACLES: "Getting out the
front door. It's a real struggle sometimes and all I can think about while
running are all the shortcuts. Then there's that level of guilt to deal with
if I didn't do it.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "As long as the joints hold up,"
Kvikstad plans to continue his routine indefinitely. "I still have trouble
with the inclines at the golf course," he says, "but now it's directly related
to how I did on the previous hole."  </TEXT>
