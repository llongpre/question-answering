<LEADPARA>  WOMEN should not ride bicycles.;    It is immoral, unfeminine and unhealthful.
It will intoxicate women to immoral acts. It will destroy families and wreck
homes. It will "ruin the feminine organs of matrimonial necessity."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those dire pronouncements were generally accepted gospel less than 100
years ago. This, ladies and gentlemen, is how far we've come.;    Today, busy
with the business of relative equality, we often forget that women once truly
were in need of liberation. Not the trivial liberation of bra-burning but the
true liberation that allows simple choices.;    Undeniably, there is still
plenty of road untraveled, but most women of my generation have enjoyed these
fundamental choices without giving them much thought. We were allowed to go to
college, to vote, to work outside the home, to ride a bicycle.;    But once
upon a time, way back in the 1890s, it was considered downright scandalous for
a woman to ride a bicycle. If women were allowed to ride bicycles, why, they'd
become wild and wicked.;    Some feared bicycling would damage pelvic muscles
and increase labor pains in childbirth. Some claimed it would destroy
"feminine symmetry and poise," as women would develop muscular legs.;   
Others feared, heaven forbid, that women would develop "bicycle eye," the
consequence of raising the eyes while the head is lowered in the riding
position.;    If at this moment you feel compelled to run out and jump on a
10-speed racer -- without a helmet! -- you understand how Frances E. Willard
felt in 1893 when she decided that she'd, by Jove, remove her corset and
straddle a bicycle if she darned well pleased.;    Thus Willard, best known as
the 19th-century temperance leader, was one of the first women ever to ride a
bicycle. Lest anyone forget, she wrote a book about it.;    Originally titled
"A Wheel Within a Wheel," the book has just been re-released as "How I Learned
to Ride the Bicycle" (Fair Oaks Publishing, $8.95).;    In this slim,
delightfully written volume, Willard describes her decision at age 53 to tame
the two-wheeled steed. She wanted to ride for her health, but also, as was her
wont, because she wasn't supposed to.;    The bicycle quickly became a
metaphor for Willard's life. She was convinced that mastery of the bicycle
would parallel the sense of accomplishment one feels upon mastering control of
one's destiny. That the principles required to master a bicycle were the same
required to master life, marriage and family.;    As she took off on her first
bike ride, she imagined the bicycle spoke to her:;    "It was divinely said
that the kingdom of God is within you," the bicycle intoned. "Some make a
mysticism of this declaration, but it is hard common sense; for the lesson you
will learn from me is this: Every kingdom over which we reign must be first
formed within us on what I as a bicycle look upon as the common parade ground
of individual thought.";    Our statesmen should be so eloquent as Willard's
bicycle.;    Needless to say, Willard tamed her steed. Bicycling quickly
became an international pastime for women and was hailed as the single most
important vehicle of women's liberation.;    At long last, women had a means
to escape the tedium of domestic indoor life. They could escape chaperons and
others who would monitor their every move.;    Most importantly, bicycles
courted the demise of the claustrophobic, suffocating corset. For cycling,
after all, necessitated that one be able to breathe. Pleasantly, women
suddenly stopped fainting as their bodies were finally freed to circulate
oxygen-bearing blood more efficiently.;    Apparently, women fell in love with
their bicycles. In 1895, Ann Strong said in the Minneapolis Tribune that
bicycles were "just as good company as most husbands." Furthermore, when a
bicycle became old and useless, said Strong, a woman could "dispose of it and
get a new one without shocking the entire community.";    Such devotion to a
bicycle is curious in an age when bicycles are as commonplace as trees. My own
bicycle is neglected and unloved, stashed in a storage shed, rusted from
disuse. A long-outgrown toddler seat bolted to the rear fender looks empty and
forlorn, like a city park without children.;    All things considered, I
wouldn't find my bike a suitable substitute for my husband. But, in deference
to the women who made the choice possible, I think I'll take her for a little
spin.  </TEXT>
