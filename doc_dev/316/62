<TEXT>     Ray Amezcua, 37, just got his mountain bike two weeks ago "and I haven't
got around to getting a helmet yet. But I just came down a hill at 35 miles an
hour and I made up my mind I'll get one.";   Eric Blanchard, 31, rides seven
or eight miles a day and says there is "no real reason" he doesn't wear a
helmet. "My mother and grandmother both have been after me to get one, so
maybe they'll send me one for Christmas.";   Vic Harney, 26, says "I spent too
much on my bike. A helmet costs too much right now, but I'll get one
eventually.";   On the other side, Laura Merlano, 15, describes herself as "a
serious rider" and says she has worn a helmet since she took up cycling two
years ago.;   "I ride about 245 miles a week and I just missed a serious
accident a while ago. I won't ride without a helmet.";   For those who ride
bikes without helmets, here are some statistics handed out by the Bicycle
Helmet Safety Institute and the National Safe Kids Campaign:;   (check) About
1,000 Americans die each year from bicycle-related injuries. About 75 percent
of them die of head injuries.;   (check) Bicycle helmets reduce risk of head
injury by 85 percent and the risk of brain injury by almost 90 percent.;  
(check) In 1989, some 351,566 children age 14-and-under were injured in
bike-related accidents.;   (check) Only 5 percent of child cyclists use bike
helmets.;   (check) A study of a Washington, D.C., cycling club showed that
members averaged 5,000 miles a year -- and on the average they crashed every
4,500 miles.;   Some of those statistics come from a study by a Seattle-based
organization, the Group Health Cooperative. Reporting in the New England
Journal of Medicine in 1989, they said that those who do not wear helmets
while riding bicycles are at eight times the risk of suffering serious head
injuries as those who do.;   Dr. Robert S. Thompson, director of preventive
care of the group, said in the article that "61 percent of all head injuries
(in bicycling accidents) occur in children.";   He added: "Parents who let
their kids ride without helmets are offering them as potential organ donors.";
  Current cycling helmet laws across the United States don't help much. In
California, a law that took effect in 1987 mandates helmets for children age
4-and-under, or weighing less than 40 pounds. This leads to the incongruous
sight of a small child in a helmet riding on a bike carrier -- and the
pedaling parent bare-headed.;   Most serious cycling stores in the Bay Area
push helmets to customers buying bicycles.;   "We strongly recommend that the
first piece of equipment they buy is a helmet," said Linda Elgart at Shaw's
Lightweight Cycles in Santa Clara.;   She said that helmets were slow to catch
on with some cyclists because "they weren't cool" -- in the fashion sense. But
with more professional cyclists, particularly Europeans, using them in races,
more recreational cyclists also put them on.;   "Greg LeMond (the top American
pro and three-time Tour de France winner) gave helmets a boost by using them,"
she added.;   Cool or uncool, LeMond or not, the statistics have made one
convert -- me. I purchased a helmet while researching this story and will
never get on a bicycle again without one.; BICYCLE HELMETS FROM $30 TO $100;
(box) GIRO (top left): swept-back, light-weight racing helmet designed for
speed events. Cost: $100.;   (box) RHODESTER (top center): children's foam
helmet, offering more protection for sides and back of head. Cost: $30.;  
(box) GIRO (lower center): Hard-shell, well-ventilated. Cost: $80.;   (box)
RHODE GEAR (lower right): foam helmet with protective mesh that holds it
together in case of a double collision. Cost: $34.; -- Mercury News Staff;
SOME WISE WORDS OF ABOUT SAFETY; HERE ARE some words of wisdom from the
Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute:;   (check) You always need a helmet whether
you ride on streets or bike paths. All cyclists crash eventually. Even a
low-speed fall on a bicycle path can cause injury.;   (check) Hard-shell or
thin-shell helmets offer better protection than soft-shell (foam only) helmets
if your crash occurs at high speed on a rough surface. All types provide good
impact protection.;   (check) If the weight of a hard-shell helmet strains
your neck, pick a thin shell. If you prefer a soft shell, choose one with a
cover and internal reinforcing to hold the foam together when you crash.;  
(check) Buy a bright color for visibility. You want motorists and other
cyclists to see you.  </TEXT>
