<LEADPARA>  IN THE cycling industry, where many companies seem to spend more time
designing their image than refining their products, Santa Cruz's Keith
Bontrager is as refreshing as a breath of fresh air on a smoggy day.;   One of
the biggest innovators in off-road bicycling, Bontrager has accumulated -- in
just 11 years -- a list of design credits so extensive they'd be impossible to
cover in a single article. But you have to pressure this soft-spoken,
36-year-old to admit that he's responsible for producing some of cycling's
most coveted products.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bontrager's hand-built cyclocross bikes have been ridden to five national
cyclocross titles. Like his mountain bikes, Bontrager Cross bikes are
considered state-of-the-art by hard-core riders.;   Bontrager has also earned
the respect of many other industry leaders. One of cycling's leading
companies, Kestrel, contracted with him to design the frames of their carbon
fiber bikes. And the lightweight rims he designed in cooperation with the
Weinmann USA company for all-terrain bikes are in demand world-wide because of
their strength.;   Bontrager said he is driven to design because of his
engineering background, and his love of the sport.;   "Bicycles are nice in a
zillion ways," he says. "I think about designs all the time. I just can't get
it out of my head.";   Other innovations to come out of Bontrager's head
include the composite fork, which he designed for dedicated off-road riders
who consistently trash conventional forks. Not only is the composite stronger,
lighter, and more reliable than a standard fork, it's more practical. If the
fork does break under extreme abuse, a rider has to replace just the broken
component, not the entire fork.;   Breakage, however, is the exception with
Bontrager-designed products. Bontrager relies on a group of hard-core riders
"who are capable of breaking anything" to evaluate his new designs. If a
component lasts six months without being damaged, Bontrager is confident with
its strength.;   "You can do all the engineering you want," Bontrager says,
"but real confidence comes if those guys can't wreck it.";   That philosophy
means that Bontrager is rarely the first manufacturer to market a specific
product. "The consequences of being too quick and not being right are more
than we could bear," he says.;   Cyclists, however, are more than willing to
wait for Bontrager's products.;   "It's an excellent company," says Brent
Cadagan, a co-owner of Pinnacle Bike Works in Los Gatos. "Keith is an
incredible technician and he's come up with one of the nicest designs on the
planet.;   "The bikes are one of the best handling around, and the strongest,"
Cadagan added. "They're very industrial bikes; they're not made to be neon."; 
 Mark Michel, owner of Santa Cruz's The Bicycle Trip, agreed. "They're really
good bikes. He has nice designs and progressive angles. Keith comes from a
rider's orientation.";   An avid cyclist, Bontrager describes his abilities in
modest terms. "I'm getting old. I'm not really willing to risk life and limb
for thrills.";   Bontrager is more concerned, however, with being a
responsible off-road bicyclist than a speedy one. "Respecting trails and
property rights is a pretty big deal for me," he said.  </TEXT>
