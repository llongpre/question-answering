OCCUPATION: Senior technical writer who was laid off last month.;   FITNESS
BACKGROUND: There weren't girls to "pal around with" in the rural area of
Pennsylvania where she grew up, so Apichell joined the boys for football,
baseball and basketball. She played varsity basketball as a freshman, pitched
and played shortstop for the softball team and would have loved the
opportunity to excel at track and field, she says, because she loved to run.
But the school didn't have a track. During the summer she worked as a
lifeguard, taught swimming and competed in springboard diving.;   Except for
intramurals, sports were on the back burner during college because "my
demanding English major required reading too many books and writing too many
papers." But during the summers, while her friends were working as waitresses,
she used the facilities at the swim and tennis club where she worked.;  
Before returning to school to earn a second degree in journalism, Apichell
taught high school English, coached basketball, ran in 5K and 10K races and
played rugby for the University of Maryland for eight years. She also taught
freshman English at the University of Florida, where she played rugby, took up
triathlons and competed in co-ed soccer.;   It was "all soccer" when she moved
to California in 1983 and joined an over-30 women's team. Because the goal of
the team was to win the national cup, they averaged three two-hour practices a
week year-round. And many of the practices were preceded by four-mile runs to
warm up. In 1988 they made it to the national tournament, but lost by one
goal.;   As new teammates in their early 30s seemed to be getting "younger and
faster," Apichell started looking for new outlets. While phasing out soccer,
she found "bicycle heaven" in the Bay Area and has been riding and running
ever since. The past year, she completed about 10 100-mile century rides and
placed in several biathlon competitions that combine running and bicycling.;  
REGIMEN: When employed, Apichell ran three to four miles every day during her
lunch hour and rode her bike in the evening until sundown. Now that it's dark
in the evening, she has upped her daytime distance to six miles and has
replaced cycling in the evening with a few hours of tennis. Weekends are still
the same, she says -- bike rides of 40 to 60 miles each day along steep routes
that include Page Mill and Kings Mountain roads, Tunitas Creek and Mount
Tamalpais.;   RESULTS: Being in good physical condition has carried over
mentally and spiritually, she says. "My health is excellent, my self-esteem is
high and, when I go into a job interview, I feel confident and proud of my
abilities.";   GOALS: To win a biathlon -- because second place is not good
enough -- and to be able to finish all five mountain passes in the 147-mile
Markleeville Death Ride in May. "And I've always wanted to try kayaking.";  
OBSTACLES: "Sometimes I wish I had a buddy to run or bicycle with regularly.
But the independence is nice. I have from sunrise to sundown to plan my
workout.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "I am not a quitter. Sports has taught me to
hang in there until the whistle is blown. I don't give up."  </TEXT>
