<LEADPARA>  WITH the Alps across the top and the Apennines down the middle, there's not a
great deal of flat terrain in Italy for leisurely pedaling. But this is a
nation of great bicycling traditions, and every Sunday on country roads all
over the boot, legions of capped and uniformed bicyclists hunch over their
handlebars, pretending to be Saronni or Fausto Coppi.;    The bicycle is also
the nimblest transportation through the traffic-strangled cities, and most
foreign pedalers can easily manage the Seven Hills of Rome in low gear. But a
word to the two-wheeled: Italian automobile drivers consider cyclists more of
a nuisance than folks entitled to a share of the roadway. Ride with extreme
caution -- and a solid helmet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      (check) ITALIAN LAKES -- The Italian lake region provides some of Italy's
best cycling. The roadways are fairly flat, particularly around the lakes
themselves, the summer temperatures moderate, the towns attractive and
well-spaced. Visitors can stop at each of the five lakes, one by one, or
cyclists with two weeks' vacation and the stamina to go 500 miles can take a
once-in-a-lifetime, two-wheel ride around them all.;    This circuit begins on
Lake Como at Menaggio, then travels north to Gravedona, follows the lake shore
around its northern tip, and heads southward, skirting Lago di Lecco's eastern
shore.;    To visit Lake d'Iseo and Lake Garda, the next lakeland
destinations, the route passes through the busy center of Bergamo. Make a stop
in the charming medieval part of the town, set high above the Lombardy plain,
before continuing on to Lake d'Iseo, where George Sand's heroine Lucrezia came
to live with her Prince Karol. Circle this scenic, less-developed lake,
passing through Sarnico, Lovere and Iseo, then head for Garda.;    The largest
and arguably the most spectacular of the Italian lakes (the poet Virgil called
it a sea), Garda is wild and Alpine in the north, softer and greener to the
south. The stretch between Salo, Mussolini's last headquarters, and Riva del
Garda is lush, verdant and entirely spectacular. In 27 miles, this road
follows the corniche over 56 bridges and burrows through 70 bridges.;   
Having pedaled through the olive groves, vineyards and cypress stands of the
eastern shore, head back to Como and admire its shores crowded with fig and
mulberry trees. Pedal alongside wilder and more exotic Lake Lugano and finally
to Lake Maggiore, where Hemingway set "Farewell to Arms," and the little town
of Luino. From there, circle broad Maggiore, weaving in and out of
Switzerland, or bike to Lavena and take the ferry to the western shore.
Hostels, campgrounds and hotels dot the way. Just stay out of the area in
August, Italy's vacation rush hour. Information: Ente Provinciale per il
Turismo, 17 Piazza Cavour, Como 22100; phone: 31-262091.;     (check) TUSCANY
-- An interesting circuit of about 50 miles starts in the busy medieval city
of Prato, not far from Florence. Take the road to Figline, Schignano,
Migliana, Vernio and Montepiano, all charming country towns way off the
tourist track. From Montepiano the road passes through green and golden
farmland to Barberino, Calenzano, and back to Prato. You'll find many
suggested itineraries for trips all over the country in Cicloturismo, a
monthly biking magazine in Italian, available at newsstands.;     (check) ROME
-- Few tourists (and fewer Romans) ever see the verdant Rome it's possible to
enjoy on the Villa Circuit, which travels 18 miles from one major public park
to another, all former private estates. Start on the silent residential
Aventine Hill, cross the Tiber, and climb up the Gianicolo to the vast Villa
Doria Pamphili. Pass by St. Peter's, cross the river again, and pedal through
the Villa Borghese gardens. The Pincio terrace, overlooking Piazza del Popolo,
offers the classic view of Rome captured by northern painters in love with the
city's unique light. Then slake your thirst in grand style at the Casina
Valadier, a regal 19th-century refreshment stand in the gardens. From there,
it's a short ride to the Villa Ada, wooded and aristocratic -- our final
suggested stop. Nino Collalti (82 Via del Pellegrino, Roma; phone: 6-654-1084)
has rental bikes.;     (check) PARCO NAZIONALE D'ABRUZZO -- Two hours east of
Rome, this national park is crisscrossed by 50 miles of an almost carless
asphalt road, as well as by a network of neglected country roads that are good
for those with mountain bikes. Good maps are available from the park
authorities. Mountain bikes are available for rent from Coop. Ecotur, 13 Via
Santa Lucia, Pescasseroli (Aquila) 67032; phone: 863-912760.  </TEXT>
