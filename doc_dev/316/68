Everybody's buying mountain bikes. More than 70% of the bikes sold these days 
are of the fat-tired variety, and while most of these never stray from the 
asphalt, lots of folks are heading for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, that has spelled conflict with other, more established 
trail users, namely hikers and horseback riders. And often, the bicyclists lose 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Orange County, word has come down that mountain bikers will be shut out 
of Upper Newport Bay Regional Park, at least for now. In some other areas, 
bikes are allowed on unpaved roads but are banned on narrow hiking and 
equestrian trails, called "single-tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that mountain bikers damage delicate trails and ride too fast, 
risking collisions with other trail users and sometimes spooking horses. But 
cyclists say that trail damage is actually less than that caused by equestrians 
and that mountain biking on the single-tracks is safe when done responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
One place where the parties have been able to bury their differences is Chino 
Hills State Park, 10,000 acres of rolling, grass-covered hills, oak groves and 
sycamore-lined canyons smack in the middle of one of the fastest-growing areas 
of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Hills, which includes parts of Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, will someday be one of the most-visited spots in the state 
park system, park officials predict. But for now it remains a largely 
undiscovered and undeveloped bit of rural backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have discovered the park -- and continue to discover it in 
increasing numbers -- are mountain bikers. But in January, 1989, the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation released its mountain bike use policy, and 
single-tracks in Chino Hills were immediately closed to bikers. Trails could 
only be reopened under written order from department officials. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Donald Murphy, in charge of Chino Hills, set up a series of 
public hearings to develop a plan for joint-use trails. And, lo and behold, 
trail users worked together. The result: Five trails have been designated for 
multiple use and, pending final state approval, could be open within the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to lose multiple-use trails, and there was a real cooperative 
feeling," said John Kelso-Shelton, chief ranger for the park. "We're sort of a 
rarity at Chino Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cunningham, who builds custom mountain bikes in Placentia, spearheaded 
the effort for the cyclists. "We all realized we were going to be seriously out 
of luck if we didn't work together," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
After the five trails were proposed, Cunningham organized more than 30 
volunteers to repair the paths, and in some sections completely rebuild them. 
Now, when combined with dirt roads in the park, mountain bikers will be able to 
choose from loop trips that vary from easy jaunts of five miles to rugged 
journeys of 20 miles and more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that bicycles have a place on every trail in every state 
park," Cunningham said. "With the five trails they picked, there should be no 
reason to use anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Coming up at Chino Hills: Horse enthusiasts might get some trails of their own. 
"The equestrians are up next," Cunningham said, "and we promised to work with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Orange County's other state park, the single tracks were never 
closed (regional superintendents have broad leeway under the state mountain 
bike policy). Crystal Cove State Park north of Laguna Beach is one of the most 
popular mountain bike spots in the county, with as many as 80% of the users 
getting about on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Trail tips: Despite the efforts of Ward and Cunningham to educate riders, 
conflicts continue to arise because of mountain bikers who ride recklessly, 
endangering other trail users and damaging trails. 
</P>
<P>
Some simple tips will help reduce conflicts and help keep the parks open to 
cyclists: 
</P>
<P>
* Always ride on designated roads and trails. Never cut your own trail. The 
parks here are too heavily used to accommodate trailblazers. 
</P>
<P>
* Always control your speed, especially around corners. Slow down when 
approaching hikers, and announce your presence -- bicycles are silent. Stop to 
let horses pass. 
</P>
<P>
* Always ride on the right side of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
* For your own safety, wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The fire that blackened much of Chino Hills State Park last week burned mostly 
grass, damaging only a few pockets of trees. Fire is part of the natural cycle 
here, and the park will be green again in just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The park is open in the meantime, but it is especially important to remain on 
the trails while riding through the burn areas. Without ground cover, the soil 
is especially vulnerable to erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning strikes: The recent lightning storm on Mt. Whitney that took the life 
of a Huntington Beach man was not an unusual occurrence. Sierra thunderstorms 
are quite common in summer, and there are precautions hikers can take if one 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
First, lightning seeks out the highest point, so try to avoid peaks and 
ridgelines. Also, do not hold tent poles or other metal objects. Cave entrances 
may seem to offer refuge but can be dangerous. Some experts advise insulating 
yourself from the ground by sitting on a rope or sleeping pad. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra thunderstorms offer another danger. Since they usually strike in the 
afternoon, the day can dawn warm and clear. Day hikers often set off in shorts 
and a T-shirt, risking hypothermia -- an often fatal lowering of the body 
temperature -- when they are caught unawares. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Inskeep of the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team advises that when 
walking any distance into the wilderness, even in summer, hikers always pack a 
jacket and wool hat -- "something that will keep you warm if you keep wet." 
</P>
<P>
He has pulled more than one hypothermia victim from the wilderness on days that 
started out bright and beautiful. Hikers, he said, are often not prepared for 
emergencies: "That's what keeps rescue teams in business, I guess."
