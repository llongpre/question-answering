   Tricycle, unicycle, skateboard, sled and
bicycle riders beware: Without a driver's license, you could get a
ticket, and your vehicle could be seized.
   The ordinance intended to put the brakes on reckless riders has
let loose a storm of protest, and one woman moved so her
13-year-old son could ride his bicycle without fear of arrest.
   The regulation, passed unanimously by aldermen Feb. 15, requires
bicyclists to have a driver's license or be supervised by someone
who does. It also applies to riders of unicycles, tricycles,
all-terrain vehicles, skateboards, minibikes, wagons, sleds,
scooters and go-carts.
   Town officials said the law was desperately needed to curtail
reckless attitudes among bike riders, especially young ones, some
of whom played ``chicken'' with cars.
   Violation of the law is a misdemeanor.
   ``The children don't have any freedom,'' said Mable Lee, who
moved two weeks ago to an area northwest of town so her son, Tom,
could ride his bike again. ``What have they got to do? There's
nothing for 'em to do.''
   Mayor Will Cathey said something had to be done to protect both
drivers and bicyclists. He added that the ordinance was passed
after three advertised public hearings, which nobody attended.
   ``After the ox got gored, then they (protesters) came down,'' he
said. ``I've received a lot of support from my constituents over
the town taking action about these bicycles, a tremendous amount of
support.''
   Rosman, population 515, has no police force. The Transylvania
County sheriff's department confiscated three bikes shortly after
the law was passed but later released them, said Jim Stroup, chief
investigator for the department.
   He said the sheriff's office is waiting to hear from the state
attorney general's office about whether the law is constitutional
before it actively enforces the ordinance.
   Under the ordinance, youthful violators will be referred to
county youth counselor Pat Roach. ``This is something we will try
to settle without going to court,'' she said. ``That's true with
any kind of complaint about a child.''
