   Greg LeMond doesn't know what he's missing. 

   Sure, America's ace bicyclist won the Tour de France on Sunday and got to pedal along the Champs Elysees as thousands cheered. 
But he's never had an Iowan in a tuxedo serve him champagne sherbet and Belgian waffles for breakfast, has he? 

   That treat, as it were, is reserved for 300 ticket-buying bike riders converging on the small but cultured town of Randall, Iowa, beginning at 5 this morning. 

   For $6 a head, partakers will dine alfresco in the town park to the sounds of a 1916 Steinway &amp; Sons grand piano. 
Free valet bike parking will be provided. 

   The affair celebrates the passing by of the unofficial Tour de Iowa, a cross-state bike ride sponsored by the Des Moines Register. 
The Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or Ragbrai as it's called, attracts thousands and is in its 17th year -- but has never before come through Randall. 

   Behind the breakfast spectacle is a group that bills itself as the smallest arts council in America. 
"When we found out they were coming through, we knew we had to do something special to make them stop," says Ellis Anderson, a Randall resident, clothing-store operator, singing teacher and arts-council member. 
The council opted for breakfast since one campsite for the week-long ride is about four miles away. 

   But nothing is simple, not even in a town of 170. 
"We wanted to serve champagne, but the town found out we couldn't get a liquor license for insurance reasons. 
So we made {champagne} sherbet. 
That's food, not liquor," says Robert McNutt, the local piano tuner and arts-council impresario. 
Mr. McNutt, who is providing the piano for the breakfast, established the arts group after migrating to Randall two years ago from Minneapolis with his piano-tuning partner Joel Yushta. 

   Not surprisingly, piano recitals are a mainstay at Randall Arts Council fetes. 
A 12-handed rendition (using three pianos and six pianists) of "Stars and Stripes Forever" two years ago has already passed into local legend, Mr. McNutt boasts. 

   He isn't worried that bicyclists who get a kick from champagne, sherbet or no, may prove a traffic hazard. 
With each breakfast, he says, "we're offering a choice of Gatorade, water or coffee."
