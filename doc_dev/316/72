Rolling Hills is preparing to pull in the reins on mountain bicyclists who are 
attracted to the city's 24 miles of equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, who say that horses are being frightened by bicyclists 
and that serious accidents could occur, are expected to pass an ordinance 
Monday outlawing bicycles and other wheeled vehicles on the trails. Motorcycles 
and all-terrain vehicles are already banned there. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've ever ridden a horse, you know they can be pretty unpredictable and 
easily startled," said Councilwoman Jody Murdock. "The trails were created for 
walking and riding and not wheeled vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the trails are up and down and have a lot of blind spots," 
said William Martin, president of Caballeros del Rancho Palos Verdes, the 
equestrian club that proposed the ordinance. "Mountain bikers come flying down 
these things and spook the horses." 
</P>
<P>
The rugged horse trails in Rolling Hills and elsewhere on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula are a natural lure for mountain bike enthusiasts. For example, the 
Portuguese Bend area of Rancho Palos Verdes, next to Rolling Hills, is popular 
among riders, said Troy Braswell, who owns a Redondo Beach bike store and heads 
the BC Riders, a mountain bike club. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said that he does not ride the trails in Rolling Hills and that his 
club tries to discourage bicyclists from using the trails. He said the club's 
code of ethics calls for bicyclists to respect equestrians everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, (the code) is to yield and be courteous," Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
In Rolling Hills, city officials said the problem with mountain bikes is not of 
crisis proportions because the entrance to the community is gated and access to 
the trails around its perimeter is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they cited a noticeable increase in the number of bicyclists 
using the trails as the sport grows in popularity. "They'll come in, 20, 30, 40 
of them on the weekend, and ride the trails," said Councilwoman Ginny 
Leeuwenburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Although no injuries have been reported, officials said there have been some 
close encounters between horses, their riders and bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance calls for signs to warn mountain bicyclists that they 
are unwelcome. Scofflaws could be ticketed by sheriff's deputies, who routinely 
patrol the trails on all-terrain vehicles, officials said. Offenders face a 
$500 fine or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said he wants the trails to remain open to bikers but understands the 
concerns of Rolling Hills residents. "I wish it was otherwise," he said, "but 
they are a very horse-oriented community, and there is some sensitivity."
