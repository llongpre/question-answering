GETTING ALONG ON THE ROAD

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bad road habits only worsen the already contentious relationship between 
cyclists and motorists. Here are a few complaints from each camp. 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclists hate when motorists: 
</P>
<P>
* Suddenly make right turns across bike lanes without so much as a glance over 
their shoulders for cyclists cruising along next to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Back out of driveways without looking for bike traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Suddenly open driver's side doors into bike lanes (often done after a 
motorist has slowly cruised in a bike lane looking for a parking space, forcing 
cyclists to brake or stop). 
</P>
<P>
* Cruise up a few feet behind cyclists and blast their horns to announce their 
presence -- or just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists hate when cyclists: 
</P>
<P>
* Blow through stop signs and red lights into heavily traveled intersections, 
without even pausing to look for traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Ride abreast or in large groups, spilling out of bike lanes and taking up 
roadways. 
</P>
<P>
* Ride against traffic, especially on roads with no bike lanes.
