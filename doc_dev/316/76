<LEADPARA>  Q What kind of bike should I look for in the $300 to $400 range?;    A The
good news is there are plenty of choices out there. The bad news is there
appear to be too many choices out there. The trick is in narrowing the
selection down to an acceptable number for effective comparison and evaluation.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before you begin to shop seriously, look around. Stay away from department
stores and large sporting goods stores. Buy from a specialty bike store or a
specialty bike department in a larger store. You want and need the advice of
solid salespeople who ride and maintain bikes themselves.;    You will also
want the continuing service of a quality bike shop for repair, basic
maintenance, advice, and that service is best provided by the shop where you
buy the bike. In some instances, free periodic service checks are provided
with certain purchases. It doesn't hurt to ask.;    Next, determine what your
riding requirements are going to be. For most people, a hybrid bike, one
combining the basic features of a mountain bike and a recreational bike, will
be adequate. Hybrid bikes are rugged enough for light, off-road use and
forgiving enough for easy pavement riding.;    Perhaps the best guide to
helping you decide what bike to purchase is the annual Bicycling Magazine
buyer's guide. If you don't have a copy, go to the library and look up the
March '91 issue.;    Bridgestone, Giant, Marin, Miyata, Raleigh, REI, Schwinn,
Specialized and Trek all offer a number of solid hybrid and mountain bike
models in the under-$450 category.;    Test ride as many as you can to narrow
the selection. Since most stores only specialize in two or three brands, you
will have to visit a number of retailers.;    Once you decide on the bike,
take the time to ensure a proper fit. You should have two inches clearance
(four inches clearance for a mountain bike) between your crotch and the top
tube of the bike when you straddle the frame flatfooted.;    The seat needs to
be adjusted so your legs are neither too straight when pedaling nor too bent.
The final adjustment will involve moving the seat forward or backward to
provide the most efficient cycling position when gripping the handle bars.
Your bike shop will take the time to fit you properly in every category.;   
Every shop receives bikes unassembled. Since assembly projects are often given
to the least experienced mechanic, check your bike out carefully. Good stores
will catch most problems during a pre-purchase tune-up. However, take the time
to ride the bike around the parking lot or around the block before writing the
check.  </TEXT>
