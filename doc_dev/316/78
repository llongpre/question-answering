<LEADPARA>  THE DOCTOR shook his head in that solemn way doctors have of confirming our
worst fears.;    "See that grease down there? The bearings are shot," he said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Forty minutes later, Eric Fetch had performed the equivalent of a hip
replacement on my 14-speed touring bike. He also installed a chain and greased
and adjusted the brakes, gears, hubs and crank set -- $96.55, parts and
labor.;    That's cheap, especially considering that this was a house call.;  
 "This entire operation could cost you around $180 in the bike shops," said
the former bicycle racer and bike shop mechanic whose business card says: "The
Bike Doctor," with a subtitle, "the doctor that still makes house calls.";   
During the four years since he started repairing bikes at homes and offices
and school campuses, his annual income has risen from $12,000 to around
$40,000, his territory has broadened from Menlo Park and Palo Alto to San
Mateo and northern Santa Clara County and his regular patient load has grown
to around 1,500. And that's without advertising -- except for one line in the
Yellow Pages.;    Eric Fetch has stumbled onto something -- an entrepreneurial
niche -- in a valley where earning a living by your wits is becoming more of a
dire necessity as the traditional economy levels off.;    'IT'S SIMPLE. I save
you having to load your greasy bike into the back of the car, dropping it off
and coming back to pick it up," he said, hoisting my bike onto a vice-like
work stand in the 14-foot cargo area of his big white truck which is filled
with tools and parts.;    He's 36, but looks maybe 30, because he rides a lot
and is in trim, athletic shape, and because no worry lines have creased his
face.;    "My goal was always to earn a decent living without killing myself,"
he said.;    He grew up in Bucks County, Pa., where he admittedly was not a
good student. He tried being a ski bum in Colorado. Then he returned to the
east and worked in a bike shop run by a guy named Bert Smith, a venerable
bicycle racer.;    Smith talked him into racing and somewhere along the road,
Fetch won a spot along with Greg LeMond on the U.S. professional road racing
team in 1983.;    He dropped out the next year. His explanation: "You have to
be sick with the sport to go through what those guys do.";    Fetch wasn't
going to kill himself.;    He bummed around the beaches and bike trails of San
Diego, North Carolina's outer banks, then Hawaii and along the way, he met his
future wife, Stephanne, now a counselor at Sequoia High in Redwood City. They
have no kids.;    HE GOT a job in a bike shop in San Mateo, where he made $10
an hour as a top-of-the-line mechanic and where the idea for a mobile bike
repair service was hatched.;    "I spent our savings on a truck and Stephanne
and I rode our bikes around town putting up fliers for house call repairs," he
said. "It seemed like a pretty simple idea.";    But now, his business has
boomed to the point where he wants out.;    "Don't get me wrong. It's great,
especially being my own boss. I work less than a 40-hour week and take long
rides at lunch. But we can't afford a house, at least where we'd want to live
and maybe raise a family.";    So, the doctor's looking for someone to buy his
thriving practice. Maybe he'll start another back in Pennsylvania, where
$40,000 goes further, or maybe he'll start some franchises. He hasn't figured
it all out yet.;    Maybe it's time for a new generation of entrepreneur who
will spurn coffee and visits with the patients or won't have time for two-hour
bike rides at lunch. Maybe the new doctor will charge more for house calls.;  
 But in this valley, ideas make the most interesting stories, not the people
who come in later to capitalize on them.  </TEXT>
