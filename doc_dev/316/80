<TEXT>     HEIGHT: 5-foot-4;    WEIGHT: 132 pounds;    PERSONAL: Married 22 years. She
has two teen-age sons and lives in San Jose.;    OCCUPATION: She's a part-time
office worker for the San Jose Unified School District's special education
department and she's on-call for a temporary agency.;    FITNESS BACKGROUND:
Feldman was born in the Soviet Union; her family came to the United States
when she was 7. Because her first priorities were learning the language and
being accepted, she was "a late bloomer," she says, at mastering skills
American kids took for granted. "Not learning to ride a bike until the age of
12 was a real scare for me," she says. "In this country, kids are on trikes at
2 and bikes by 3." She learned to swim soon after.;    After overcoming her
"inefficiencies," Feldman says that overcoming self-inflicted fears became a
new challenge for her. While living in Wisconsin, she learned and enjoyed
roller skating, ice skating and swimming. But since moving to California 17
years ago, she has taken up downhill skiing, windsurfing and horseback riding.
She has tried para-sailing, although her "heart was in her hand" when she did
it, and she tried cliff diving at a family camp.;    REGIMEN: "Bicycling with
Benji," her Pomeranian, "is my thing," she says. (She's on her fourth bike.)
They tour the neighborhood for an hour three times a week and, on the
weekends, they ride on bike trails with her husband. When it's too cold to
ride, she and Benji walk a few miles.;    Feldman does lap and recreational
swimming at the YMCA at least three times a week. She does roller skate
dancing, which includes the tango, waltz and "a little boogie," two hours, two
or three times a week, and she takes a private lesson every other Thursday.
(She's on her third pair of skates.);    She and her family ski frequently
during the winter. And the moguls at Heavenly don't hinder her, she says. When
the weather warms up, she'll resume windsurfing on local lakes. With a little
more proficiency and a wet suit, she'll be out on the bay, she says.;   
RESULTS: "I have found a wonderful balance between all that matters: family,
work and exercise.";    GOALS: Israeli dancing and para-flying -- it involves
an airborne motorized device that looks like a lawn chair with wheels -- are
"on the back burner," she says. "I'm guess I'm looking for challenges in the
air that I've enjoyed on the ground and in the water.";    OBSTACLES: To
combat lack of motivation, she gets dressed first thing in the morning and
sets a time to be out of the house. "Motivation comes with that first breath
of fresh air.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "Exercise is drudgery when it's not fun.
I don't understand how those gals at the rink can skate six days a week when
there are so many other things to do. I honestly can't tell you what I like to
do best."  </TEXT>
