What started as a two-week stint in California -- to accommodate his work as an 
extra in a remake of a Shirley Temple film -- has now become an 11-year stay 
for Rick Denman, 32, program director of the Encino Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
While an engineering student at the University of Michigan in 1979, Denman was 
recruited for his ability to ride on a banked, wooden indoor track that he 
frequented in nearby Southfield and that was moved to California for a scene in 
the film "Little Miss Marker." 
</P>
<P>
The indoor track in Michigan was banked at 58 degrees, compared to 34 degrees 
at Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills and 27 degrees at Encino 
Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
"That track was so steep that you could put your feet at the base and reach out 
and touch the wall," said Denman, who lives in North Hollywood. "There weren't 
too many people who could ride it or (were) willing to." 
</P>
<P>
By the time filming was over, Denman had become fascinated with the operation 
of motion-picture cameras and began answering casting calls requiring 
bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"As a competitive cyclist, I was able to understand the needs and the camera 
angles to document them realistically," said Denman, the winner of the points 
race in the 1982 Far West championships and who recently placed seventh in the 
masters national championships in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Denman's expertise gained the attention of the makers of the 1985 film 
"American Flyers." Denman fitted the bikes with cameras and rode the cycles 
while the bicycle footage was being filmed. He also was the technical 
coordinator for "Quicksilver," recruiting and training the actors and cyclists 
involved in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Denman, who was a coach at the 1987 U. S. Olympic Festival, has now helped 
coordinate more than 100 commercials, including the recent Miller Tour de Lite 
commercial in which he worked with the rap group RUN DMC and "Cheers" star 
Woody Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting better and better all the time," Denman said. "There 
seem to be more and more offers. There have been no regrets (about leaving 
engineering) whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-training: If Brad Kearns is in good cycling shape, there is a distinct 
possibility that he also will be in good triathlon condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout my career, when I'm doing well in all three areas, my cycling has 
been right up there," said Kearns, 25, who will compete in the National City 
Corp. triathlon in Cleveland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my training is on the bike. I spend about two to three hours' riding a 
day compared to only an hour running and in the pool. The cardiovascular 
effects of it transfers to my swimming and running." 
</P>
<P>
And lately, based upon recent performances, Kearns, a former Taft High 
cross-country and track standout, has been spending a lot of time on his wheels 
in preparation for the NCC, which will serve as the 1990 national championship 
for the Triathlon Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, who said that he often cycles as many as 300 miles a week during heavy 
training, won the Oxnard Sports Festival triathlon last month and the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center triathlon in June. In the latter, he topped a 
field that included Scott Tinley, the defending champion and four-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in Cleveland -- the competition consists of a 
1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bike and 10-kilometer run -- will qualify for 
the world championships Sept. 15 at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Prize money totaling $20,000, including $3,500 for first place, will be at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll qualify, no problem," said Kearns, who plans to push the pace on 
the bike portion. "There's no holding back. The best times come when you go all 
out on the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time I: The leaders in the ninth Race Across America are nearing the 
halfway point of a 2,922-mile course that began Sunday in Irvine and will end 
sometime next week in Savannah, Ga. This year marks the first time the race 
will finish in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
In which other cities has the race finished? 
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar bicyclists: A Working Man's division was launched at Encino 
Velodrome last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The new category is designed to supplement the existing four divisions and help 
promote parity among riders. Previously, the categories ranged from Division I 
(advanced) through Division IV (beginning). 
</P>
<P>
Denman said that in the Division III races, masters riders (age 30 and older) 
often were overmatched by former national-class riders in that age bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"It was instituted in order to keep the guys in the 40s and 50s coming back and 
at the same time keep the fields competitive," Denman said. "It also helps 
educate the newcomers from the working class with a lot of speed but no 
experience to hash it out against the real top pros." 
</P>
<P>
Seven riders participated in the Working Man's division last week and Denman is 
expecting a bigger turnout Saturday, including 10-time national champion and 
two-time Olympian (1972 and 1976) Ron Skarin of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Skarin, a gold medalist in the 1975 Pan American Games in the team pursuit, 
holds the world record for distance traveled in one hour in a human-powered 
vehicle (slightly more than 47 miles). 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time II: Which country has won the most consecutive gold medals in 
Olympic team-pursuit competition? 
</P>
<P>
Triple threat: Matt Rayner of the Montrose Cycle Club has been dominating 
competition for the omnium at Encino Velodrome the past two weeks and will be 
seeking his third consecutive title Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded each night for three races -- the points race, the 
miss-and-out, and the scratch race. In winning the past two omniums, Rayner, 
27, of Sylmar, has won five of a possible six races. 
</P>
<P>
Rayner, a member of the 1987 national team pursuit champion, recently returned 
from competition in Europe. He is gearing up for the Madison national 
championships on Aug. 31 in Allentown, Pa., where he will team with Chris Gaido 
of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer I: Past RAAM routes, all of which originated in Orange County, 
ended in New York City; Atlantic City, N.J.; and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
In remembrance: A 10-mile race to commemorate one of the founders of Encino 
Velodrome will be held at the venue Aug. 25. The event will be coordinated by 
the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp, 84, one of the founders of the nonprofit velodrome that was 
constructed in 1960, passed away last week after suffering a massive heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer II: Italy won the team-pursuit in four Olympiads, spanning the 
period from 1908 through 1920.
