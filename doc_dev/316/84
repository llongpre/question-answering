Since skateboarding took off in the late '70s, parents and pediatricians have 
tended to worry most about little skaters hitting the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a new study suggests that older adolescents -- aged 15 to 18 -- are the 
ones to watch. They are most likely to suffer skateboard injuries, followed by 
kids aged 6 to 9 and then kids aged 10 to 14, according to Dr. Robert A. 
Pendergrast, assistant pediatrics professor at the Medical College of Georgia.

<P>
Pendergrast researched the mishaps of 94 Baltimore skateboarders, 6 to 18 years 
old, and published his findings recently in the Journal of Adolescent Health 
Care. 
</P>
<P>
"These 15- to 18-year-olds are stronger and ride with more velocity and force," 
Pendergrast said. Older skateboarders take their skill for granted, added Dr. 
Alexander R. Lampone, medical director of the emergency department at St. 
John's Hospital and Health Center, Santa Monica.

Short of banning the boards -- a move Pendergrast opposes -- parents and 
pediatricians are asking how skateboarding can be made safer. "Helmet use is 
most important," Pendergrast said. "Street skateboarders don't think about 
wearing helmets; it's just not cool." But helmets are worn at skateboarding 
competitions, and Pendergrast hopes the practice will soon catch on with other 
skateboarders as well. 
</P>

A bicycle helmet works almost as well as a helmet designed specifically for 
skateboarding, say some doctors. (Skateboarding helmets are harder to find than 
bicycle helmets. One manufacturer that does make a special skateboarding helmet 
is Pro-Tec, (800) 338-6068. It has more padding and offers more head coverage 
than most bike helmets, said a spokeswoman.) 
</P>
<P>
Skateboarding in a "controlled environment" such as a skateboarding park is 
safer than street boarding, Pendergrast added. Protective padding at knees and 
elbows is also advised.

Children younger than the age of 5 should never ride skateboards, warns the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. In a policy statement published last year in 
the journal Pediatrics, the academy said youngsters that age "are not 
developmentally prepared to protect themselves from injury." Their high center 
of gravity impedes their ability to break a fall.
