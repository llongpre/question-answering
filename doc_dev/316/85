A Fullerton College art professor suffered fatal head injuries when he was 
struck by a car as he rode his bicycle to work early Wednesday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hendricks, 41, an artist who had taught at the college since 1975 and 
served for 3 years as Brea's artist in residence, was hit at 6:51 a.m. a few 
blocks from the campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks was pronounced dead Wednesday evening at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he had been on life support systems, a spokesman for the 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Police Officer Laura Rivera said that Hendricks was riding north on 
Lemon Street when he was hit by a car going east on Chapman Avenue. The driver, 
a 21-year-old Buena Park man, was not arrested or cited, but the accident was 
still under investigation, Rivera said, and police are seeking more witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks suffered severe head injuries, a broken left collarbone and a broken 
right leg, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Students and colleagues on Wednesday described Hendricks as a popular teacher 
and an outdoorsman who surfed with his children, swam laps in the Fullerton 
College pool and rode his bike to work every day. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Johnson, an art instructor who attended Orange High School with Hendricks 
in the late 1960s and shared an office with him at the college, said he had a 
tremendous following among art students. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people came here just to take him," Johnson said. "He was a real 
strong family man. He always had time to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks and his wife had been married for 21 years and had four children; 
Scott, an art student at Cal State Fullerton; Christina, a student at Brigham 
Young University in Utah; Tim, 12, and Courtney, 9. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Wine, an art student who had taken several courses under Hendricks, said 
that he regularly showed Hendricks his latest artwork and was particularly 
proud to have some of his works on display with Hendricks' paintings at recent 
art shows. 
</P>
<P>
"He could see things in students as artists and he would guide them and 
encourage them," Wine said. "His opinion of my artwork was very valuable. I was 
going to show him one of my new works when I heard" of the accident, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks specialized in watercolors and he often focused on landscapes around 
Orange County, his colleagues said. They added that Hendricks loved to paint 
outdoors, rather than from photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very prolific young painter," said Larry Friedrich, chairman of 
Fullerton College's art department. "He was a very competent, capable artist, 
and a very good instructor." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks' works were displayed in art shows across the nation and in 
Switzerland, a Fullerton College spokesman said. He had a number of exhibits in 
Orange County galleries in the past few years and one local gallery, Art Angles 
in Orange, was preparing an art show with Hendricks' works that was to open 
Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Stature' 
</P>
<P>
Mel Schusterman, owner of the gallery that was to display more than 30 of 
Hendricks' paintings, said he had "great stature" in the Southern California 
cultural community and was widely respected by his peers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an exceptional example of an artist turning away from Modernism to 
portray natural things," Schusterman said, adding that the show has been 
postponed but that the gallery may hold a memorial exhibit soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, a lifelong Orange County resident who was raised in the Silverado 
Canyon area, was graduated from Cal State Fullerton in 1971 with a bachelor's 
degree in art. He received his master of arts degree in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
He has taught at Cal State Fullerton, Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago 
College), the Hollywood Arts School and Park View School in Huntington Beach, a 
Fullerton College spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks received the California Arts Council's artist-in-residence grants for 
3 consecutive years beginning in 1981 and served as the city of Brea's artist 
in residence during that time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gave Free Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Kathie Conrey of the Brea community services department said that Hendricks 
held free demonstrations of watercolor painting at the city's Civic Cultural 
Center and at local schools. He often worked with children on exhibits and 
received "stacks" of letters from youngsters thanking him, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a wonderful gift of communication and a wonderful sense of humor," 
Conrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said that Hendricks was active in the Mormon Church and planned to 
spend the 1989-1990 school year teaching at Brigham Young University. Johnson, 
his colleague, said that he may have wanted to teach there permanently. 
</P>
<P>
About four or five of Hendricks friends from the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in Fullerton gathered in the waiting room Wednesday morning 
to wait for reports on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Terry, was busy making phone calls and trying to reach their daughter 
Christina. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a good friend of mine," said Michael Lowe, a 20-year friend of 
Hendricks. "He was just one of those special people who did those things well. 
I guess he just loved the grace in life, the pretty things." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police ask that any witnesses to the accident contact investigator 
Tak Kim at (714) 738-6813.
