<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; CHANGE; BICYCLE; REGULATION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Santa Clara has finally opened its expressways to bicycles, ending a
three-year fight between cyclists, on the one hand, and parents and teachers
on the other.;    The city council voted early Wednesday to end the
longstanding restrictions on Lawrence and San Tomas expressways after an
emotional public hearing that lasted two hours.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The city had been the only one in the region to maintain a ban on bicycling
along expressway shoulders. Cyclists said the ban stymied them from getting to
the city's large industrial district from their homes in San Jose and on the
Peninsula.;    Santa Clara kept the ban because the city's educators and
police chief thought that opening the roads to bicycles would encourage
children to use those routes and could result in serious injuries or deaths.
The city's staff, which supported the ban, noted that the expressways could be
tempting to children at eight nearby schools.;    Responding to traffic
congestion, every other city in the county over the past three years has
opened expressways to cyclists. City engineer Bruce Auguson said there were 31
accidents involving bicycles on the expressways last year, with the bulk of
them -- 12 -- on busy Foothill Expressway.;    There were 57 cycling accidents
last year in the city of Santa Clara, mostly on busy streets such as El
Camino, where bicycles share the road with cars.;    The council voted 4-2 to
drop the ban after two hours of public testimony, but agreed to review the
decision in a year.;    Many people rode bikes to the hearing, which ended
around 1 a.m. Concerned parents also persevered into the late hour to tell the
council they were worried that if children saw adults riding on the busy roads
they would follow their example.;    Councilwoman Sue Lasher, who serves on
transportation committees for the city, led the council's argument to open the
roads. She was the object of an emotional attack from an elderly resident who
accused her of not caring if children were killed.;    Several council members
came to the defense of Lasher, who noted that parents have to teach children
where to ride. She said she feared the current law was hurting the environment
and preventing responsible riders from commuting.;    "If a child is going to
disobey his parents and ride on the expressway, he could do it now," she said.  </TEXT>
