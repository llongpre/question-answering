<LEADPARA>  THE 16 bicyclists met for class at an urban park just north of downtown,
gathering only a couple hundred feet from a pack of bare-chested, tattooed men
guzzling beer out of paper bags.;   The students adjusted their helmets and
anxiously straddled their mountain bikes. Their instructor, Jodi Dayton, was
set to begin her lesson in bicycle use and safety. But first, a quick
precaution:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Nobody's armed, are they? I don't want anybody getting shot today.";   One
man stripped off his gun belt and sheepishly handed it to the teacher like a
schoolboy caught chewing gum in class. It was clear from the start that this
was no ordinary afternoon in the park.;   The pedaling students were all
police officers and sheriff's deputies assigned to bike patrols. They had come
from local agencies, the Bay Area and Los Angeles County to attend the only
state-certified bike patrol class for California law enforcement.;   During
the recent three-day class -- only the third time it's been offered --
instructors taught techniques vital to police work. But many of the lessons
are helpful to novice and even intermediate bikers who ride on and off the
road.;   "My biggest concern is getting hit by a car. I'm more concerned about
getting getting hit by a car than getting shot," said one instructor, Officer
Gary McLaughlin of the Sacramento Police Department's bike patrol. "If you
follow the rules of the road, that shouldn't happen.";   So, mixed in with
helpful hints on how to knock down bad guys with your bike or how to clunk a
wise guy with your baton without losing your balance, the students also were
instructed on basic bicycle maintenance, nutrition, sports injuries, hill- and
step-climbing, rolling down hills, mastering wet pavement and riding through
traffic.;   McLaughlin; Dayton, a California State Police officer; and a third
instructor -- Dale Newhouse, also a Sacramento Police bike patrol officer --
created the class earlier this year in response to a demand that has been
growing since 1987. That's when two Seattle police officers established what
is generally regarded as the nation's first modern police bike patrol.;  
Since then, badges on bikes has become a growth industry for law enforcement
in California and throughout the country.;   The League of American Wheelmen,
a nationwide bicycling advocacy group, estimates that at least 170 departments
either have patrols or are considering them.;   In addition to the two
Sacramento patrols, other California agencies that have established bike
patrols in recent years include the cities of San Jose, Hayward, Santa Cruz,
Oakland, San Francisco, San Diego and Santa Barbara, along with the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Office, BART and the University of
California-Berkeley and UC-Davis.  </TEXT>
