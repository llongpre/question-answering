<LEADPARA>  French bicyclists Jean Michel Karsenti and Gilles Dannecker are a long way
from home.;   After riding their bikes 3,600 miles across the country in 34
days, Karsenti, 25, and Dannecker, 20, have ended their journey in Fremont,
where Dannecker's cousin lives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And they're impressed. Not only with Fremont, but the entire country.;  
Besides spending less money than they expected along the way, there was
another pleasant surprise: the people.;   "Everyone has been so friendly,
people we didn't even know started talking to us, inviting us into their
home," said Karsenti, who is staying with Dannecker's Fremont relatives.;  
"That's one thing you wouldn't find in Europe, at least France, people being
so friendly to travelers.";   Sponsored by the French company, Vitamin
Systems, their journey -- which they documented along the way -- began as much
as a lesson in ecology as for a personal challenge.;   "The company was
interested in ecology, particularly since everyone travels by car," Karsenti
said. "They wanted us to document how we managed to get along without all
that.";   When they return to France, Karsenti and Dannecker are expected to
detail their experiences to students.;   They began the long ride from New
York to California on Aug. 5 -- three days after arriving from France by
plane.;   The two rode through Utah, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado and,
ultimately, California where the image of Yosemite National Park lingers.;  
Except for Nevada, where they traveled long distances without seeing a city,
endured windy and dry conditions and went without food for a long stretch,
most of their journey went smoothly. Though they often slept in people's
homes, hotels or campsites, they once were forced to sleep in an abandoned car
they found along the highway in Nevada.;   "We didn't think it would be so
easy," said Karsenti, who along with Dannecker, rode from sunrise to sunset
each day with only one day of rest a week.;   The two, both avid sportsmen,
have raced bikes long before, each traveling long distances in Europe.;  
"This was our longest trip, but we feel better than when we started," said
Dannecker, who is studying biology in Nantes, France.;   "Living like a nomad
and seeing something different everyday was an adventure. We never got
bored.";   Karsenti, who recently completed his studies in business in
Montepellier, France, says the trip has inspired him to travel more.;   Maybe,
Australia or New Zealand.  </TEXT>
