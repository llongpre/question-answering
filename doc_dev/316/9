<LEADPARA>  EVERY few years, to test my theory that bicyclists have no sense of humor, I
write something suggesting that they and their two-wheeled machines are
impediments to the smooth flow of traffic on the streets of Santa Cruz.;    I
did this recently, noting that bike riders exhibit a self-righteous arrogance
toward people in automobiles, letting us know by their every movement and
gesture that they consider us to be environmental vandals.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I also pointed out that bicyclists don't, as least as far as I've been able
to discern, feel that the traffic laws governing coming to a halt at stop
signs applies to them.;    Well, my theory is still intact. Bicyclists do not,
indeed, have a sense of humor.;    As I could have predicted, the usual spate
of nasty (and, of course, self-righteous) hate mail was launched toward the
Mercury News. The paper printed one epistle in the letters-to-the-editor
column and forwarded the rest to me. Poring over them, I can't find any
suggestion that any of the bike-rider/letter-writers appreciated that I was
writing a humor column.;    The guy whose note appeared in the
letters-to-the-editor column did mention that he thought my piece amounted to
"heavily negative 'humor,' " which, I have to admit, is probably true if
you're a bicycle nut. Fortunately, most of us aren't, so for most of us it
was, hopefully, humor without quotation marks.;    That same writer made what
he believed, I'm certain, was a good point:;    "And since when is building a
road through fields and woods not effectively vandalism?";    FRANKLY, I think
building a road through the woods or across a meadow is a better idea than
allowing those of us who favor automobiles to just plow through a field or
bulldoze our way through a forest wherever we choose. From my point of view, a
road is the opposite of vandalism; it keeps us on the pavement instead of
driving along any route we want across a field or through the woods.;   
Another letter writer called my column "attempted humor." Perhaps he's
correct, but I doubt it, since he's also a cyclist and my theory is that as
such he has no sense of humor. He hit close to the mark, though, when he
correctly accused me of using "ridicule and stereotype" in my mention of the
problems caused for motorists by bicycle-riders.;    A third angry letter
writer says my column "makes the goal of a harmonious existence of bicyclists,
motorists and pedestrians even harder to achieve. I subscribe to the San Jose
Mercury News, find no humor in Mr. Quarnstrom's column, and am offended by
it.";    Good! Oh, I mean "good" if somehow I've been able to disrupt what
this fellow speciously thinks of as "a harmonious existence" between bike
riders and the rest of us who live in mortal fear of running over one of the
irresponsible cyclists who swerve in front of our cars, fail to come to a halt
at stop signs and test our patience and civility by flipping us the bird
seemingly at random.;    A FOURTH letter comes from a fellow who says that
bikers "rarely flip the bird at motorists. Generally they do so only when
someone tries to run them off the road, cuts them off at an intersection,
opens a car door directly in front of them or in some other way rudely
endangers their lives. If Quarnstrom is being routinely flipped off, perhaps
it is time his own driving habits were examined.";    Actually, I've seen
drivers ranging from little old ladies to teen-agers flipped off by people on
bicycles. I don't think it has so much to do with the driving habits of
anyone, myself included, as with the aura of self-righteousness that bike
enthusiasts arrogantly adopt on the theory that motorists are creeps for using
fossil fuel while cyclists are saints for using pedal power.;    Of course, I
do appreciate the fact that for every bicycle there's one more parking space
available somewhere for my Ford Crown Victoria.  </TEXT>
