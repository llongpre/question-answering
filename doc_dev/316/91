<LEADPARA>  Thousands of Fremont students walked to school, rode their bikes or hitched
rides from Mom and Dad on Wednesday instead of riding the bus as a new
$1.10-per-day transportation fee took effect on the first day of school.;  
Some school buses ran with as few as three or four students. Many carried just
one-third of their capacity.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We have no idea yet how many students rode the bus to school this
morning," said Ed White, Fremont Unified School District transportation
director. "I'm sure our numbers are down from last year. But it usually picks
up as the year goes on.";   Last year, when transportation was free, an
average of 9,200 students took the bus to school every day. This year, roughly
600 families signed up for busing, with each family buying bus passes for up
to two children; additional children ride free.;   Though many parents said
they object to the bus fee, officials said ridership always starts out low.
Many parents historically have driven their young children to school on the
first day. Some families are still on vacation. Others are still making
transportation arrangements for their children.;   Still, that left thousands
of students who once rode the bus finding alternative ways to get to class.;  
One bus driver said she saw several junior high students waiting for AC
Transit buses along Paseo Padre Parkway because their former bus stops had
been eliminated in budget cuts. Scores of junior high and high school students
rode their bicycles to school.;   And many parents, some determined to avoid
the bus fee, drove their children to class, crowding into school driveways
alongside sparsely occupied buses.;   It was one of the first visible results
of last spring's huge budget cuts in which Fremont Unified reduced bus routes
and adopted the fee of $1.10 a day, or $200 a year.;   "I wasn't disposed to
put out the money for a bus pass," said Martha Dobney, who dropped off her
son, Bryan, at Mission Valley Elementary School and another child at Hopkins
Junior High. "I'm going to be going to two schools twice a day.";   But she
was sympathetic to the district's financial plight and said she'd rather
busing be cut than counselors. "I think a lot of people are going to realize
we have a problem," she said. "Something's got to give.";   The crush of cars
was especially heavy at Mattos Elementary, where many parents are angry they
must pay to bus their children four miles from the Northgate area to their
assigned school even though three other schools are within walking distance.
They were upset that the school district exempted another neighborhood,
Ardenwood Forest, from paying the new fee because those children live eight
miles from their assigned school.;   "I feel if they're going to charge fees,
they should charge everyone," said Northgate parent Alice Chromy, who was
picking up her son from Mattos. "It's a real touchy situation for us. It's too
far to walk and too far to ride a bike. If the kids don't get a (car) ride,
they have to ride the bus. A lot of families can't afford it.";   Mattos
parents plan to bring a formal petition and protest to the school board asking
for an exemption to the fee.;   At Weibel Elementary, bus driver Martha
Rollins drove about 20 children to and from school -- less than a third her
normal load. To get aboard, each child had to show a special pass -- a drawing
of a school bus with the child's name inscribed on it.;   Rollins said she
must pay to bus her own children to elementary school, even though she is a
district bus driver. To save money, she let an older child ride his bike to
Warm Springs Elementary and paid to bus a younger child to Leitch Elementary.;
  "Being in the middle, I can see how we have to charge for busing," she said.
"The district just doesn't have the money. But as a parent, I don't like it.";
  The school board in May voted to cut $950,000 of the $2.7 million
transportation budget to help make up a record $7.8 million deficit. That
meant cutting some of the 42 routes, increasing the distance students must
live from school to qualify for busing, and charging the fee.;   Two weeks
ago, White reported about 400 families signed up for school busing. Since
then, about 200 more parents have lined up at his tiny office. About 400 of
the children who get bused are from Ardenwood Forest.;   Fremont Unified had
expected about 1,800 students would pay for busing, a figure used to support
the costs of running the system. White said the district would decide in a
week whether to drop or merge any of the routes.;   "It's always hectic the
first day," he said. "Little kids get lost. They stand at the wrong bus stop.
Today it went rather smoothly. Everyone got to school."  </TEXT>
