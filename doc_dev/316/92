<LEADPARA>  IF MOM and Dad have multispeed off-road bikes capable of taking on mountains,
why is junior stuck with a one-speed barely capable of taking on a steep
driveway?;    "Because we said so" may not be a sufficient answer. More and
more manufacturers have been scaling down mountain bikes to 20- or 24-inch
wheels, dimensions kids can ride.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "There's at least 15 manufacturers selling mountain bikes for kids," said
Tim Blumenthal, editor of mountain biking for Bicycling magazine of Emmaus,
Pa. "My guess is that's three times the number of two years ago.";    However,
it's not easy for a non-expert to tell a good children's bike from a bad one,
said Jim Hasenauer, a spokesman in Los Angeles for the International Mountain
Bicycling Association.;    Cost-cutting can be hidden in such areas as cheap
frame tubing, poor welds or rough bearing assemblies, Hasenauer said.;    Like
their grown-up relatives, a child's mountain bike is a fat-tired machine with
upright handlebars, hand brakes and many gears. And like an adult's, it should
be tough enough to roll over trees, through deserts and across boulders.;   
"The one aspect that kids really do appreciate is the durability," Blumenthal
said.;    He also thinks children may have a natural affinity for mountain
biking that comes from having less fear and a good sense of balance.;   
Blumenthal considers the mountain bike potentially stronger than the current
children's standard, the BMX (bicycle motocross), a low-slung one-speed.;   
Another advantage is the gearing. Six speeds, typical on a child's mountain
bike, makes biking easier than does the one gear that's standard on BMX.;   
The gears on a child's mountain bike cover the middle section of the 18-gear
range on an adult's mountain bike.;    Multispeed gearing may help children to
cycle farther or higher, but even a superb multispeed won't turn a kid into an
adult, Blumenthal pointed out. "I don't think you can expect a subteen --
under 11 or 12 -- to last more than an hour and a half," he said.;    What's
more, derailleur gearing (outside the rear wheel hub) can go out of alignment
under the abuse that kids can give a bike, while a simple one-speed is a lot
harder to destroy.;    Children younger than 8 may have trouble mastering the
shifting or summoning the endurance to get the most from a mountain bike,
Blumenthal said.;    So, the experts say, parents should expect some
improvement, but no giant leap in endurance or distance when their preteen or
young teen moves from a BMX to a mountain bike.;    To encourage a child to
like mountain biking, let him see good role models by taking him to mountain
biking events, said Hasenauer. Also, he said, give the child a specific
destination -- kids may not ride just to enjoy the scenery, but could be
enticed into a trip if a picnic or a swim is at the end of it.;    And a good
helmet for protection in an accident is essential.  </TEXT>
