BACKGROUND: Kachner has had an affinity for water since her first swim lesson.
By age 6, she was swimming competitively in butterfly, backstroke and
freestyle events. She did synchronized swimming in her early teens and during
high school and college, she swam six days a week in order to win medals and
collegiate championships. "Although at times I felt physically exhausted and
had doubts about the commitment, I learned a lot about teamwork and my own
capabilities physically and emotionally. When you think you can't go any
farther, there is always something left.";    When she moved from Ohio to
California in 1979, she discovered sourdough French bread, cheese, great
restaurants and Mrs. Fields cookies, she says. "I started living the typical
Silicon Valley lifestyle: work all day, late dinners accompanied by California
wine, then home to bed. Business meetings were always scheduled around meals
and I had to eat a lot of high-fat restaurant fare while traveling.";   
Kachner gained "a lot" of weight, she says. "Although I was having a wonderful
time, I was stressed, less effective on my job, and I felt an undercurrent of
unhealthiness." A reflective moment in front of a mirror turned her life
around, she says. "I decided to get healthy and back in the water where I
belonged.";    REGIMEN: Two years ago, her regular swimming, running and
bicycling routine paid off when she finished her first triathlon -- "it was a
little one held at Stanford." Since then, she has continued her daily routine,
which includes a 15- to 20-mile bike ride or one hour of non-stop swimming one
day, and a five-mile run or a one-hour aerobics workout the next. "I choose
the activity based on my mood that day because I like to mix it up.";    A
year ago, "the first time I put my face mask in the water and looked down at
all those wonderful creatures, I fell in love," she says. She's been scuba
diving on weekends ever since. "And you have to be in shape to put on 50
pounds of equipment, walk to the surf line and kick out to the dive site. When
you do that twice a day, that's a good workout!";    RESULTS: She has lost "a
lot" of weight. "I feel cheerful, energetic and I enjoy the way I look and
feel, which I think comes across.";    GOALS: "To be healthy and make keeping
fit an enjoyable activity for the rest of my life.";    OBSTACLES: "On the
days I can't get geared up, I put on comfortable shoes and take a walk
instead. Once I get out, I always feel better.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "Scuba
diving helps me find a sense of peace in this crazy world. Because you have to
be alert, you can't worry about work or your problems. There's no sound, no
smell and all you can hear is your own breathing. And it's a place where you
can escape from the whole valley package -- car, coordinated clothes and job
-- and be accepted just as you are."  </TEXT>
