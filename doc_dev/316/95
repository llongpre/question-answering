<LEADPARA>  'TIS THE season for wet and muddy trails, and that means two things.;   First,
if you are thinking of riding your bike on muddy trails, don't! You'll only
churn up the mud and ruin the trail. Second, no matter where you ride, dirty,
wet, and/or sandy conditions dictate that you clean your bike frequently. Grit
and sand act as a grinding agent, wearing down every moving part in your bike.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The sooner you remove the grime the longer the life of your bike and its
various parts.;   Use the following as a guide to de-gritting your bike:;  
(check) Rinse. Remove caked-on mud and grime by gently spraying with a garden
hose. Never use high pressure because it is possible to blast water into the
sealed bearings of the hubs and crank. Also, don't wipe dirt or mud from your
bike with a rag because you risk scratching and ruining the finish.;   (check)
De-grease. Remove the wheels and set them aside. Using a bucket of warm water
and a mild detergent, scrub the derailleurs, chain and chain rings with a
bottle brush. Rinse using the bottle brush again to scrub the chain,
derailleurs and chain ring.;   (check) Wash. Using a floor type bristle brush,
warm water and a mild detergent, gently wash the frame and wheels. A bottle
brush is useful for getting behind the chain rings and other hard to reach
spots. Next, start at the hubs and work out, cleaning both wheels. Scrub the
rim and tires with a floor brush to remove oil and tar residue.;   (check)
Final rinse. Re-install the wheels and gently rinse off the bike.;   (check)
Dry thoroughly. Wipe off surface water with a soft towel. Put your bike in a
warm place to dry. The tubes of your bike should have drain holes to help let
the moisture out. Hanging your bike by its front wheel and removing the seat
will allow some moisture that may have collected in the frame tubes to drain
out the seat tube.;   Once your bike is dry you will need to lubricate the
parts that you de-greased and any other areas that may need attention.;  
(check) Chain, derailleur pulleys. For dry weather, use a lube that will
penetrate, such as Tri-Flow. Be careful not to overspray on the rims and wipe
away excess lubrication. For wet or muddy terrain use a heavy oil such as
Campagnolo or Phil Wood.;   (check) Cables. While some manufacturers recommend
running the cables dry, performance in very wet conditions may be improved
with application of silicone to the cable end buttons and entrance points.
Check with your bike shop for advice.;   (check) Sealed bearings. Unless you
are a mechanic it is best to have your favorite bike shop do this for you
periodically.;   (check) Seat post. Keep this clean and lightly greased with a
heavy grease such as Campagnolo.;   (check) Saddle. Preserve leather by
rubbing with Brooks Proofhide and then lightly dusting with talc.;   (check)
Pump. Keep leather gaskets lubricated with Vaseline and rubber gaskets with
K-Y jelly.  </TEXT>
