   Ko Suk-je lined up 50 pairs of roller
skates in neat rows as a spring breeze whipped across the square
and hundreds of people whirled around on bikes and skates.
   ``Spring is the best season; everyone comes out,'' Ko said with
a smile as he tugged on his red baseball cap.
   Another bitterly cold Korean winter has come and gone. A pale
spring sun drew out crowds from thousands of small apartments where
they had been cooped up for five months.
   Purple and yellow blooms were just starting to unfold on trees
and bushes on the edges of Yoido square.
   The mile-long tarmac square is one of the few open spaces in the
bustling city of 10 million, and people flock to it once warm
weather arrives.
   The city, main site of the 1988 Summer Olympics, has few public
parks or other open areas and many people live in drab concrete
apartment buildings that stretch for miles around the city.
   ``There's no space in Seoul,'' said Ko, the skate renter. ``This
is the only place in the city where there's space.''
   On this balmy day, students, children and whole families had
come to Yoido to rent bikes or roller skates and just ride round
and round.
   ``We feel free,'' said Kim Mi-ji, a college student who was
skipping afternoon classes to go bike riding with her friends. ``We
enjoy ourselves a lot.''
   Thousands of bikes and skates were lined up on one side of the
square, waiting to be rented for about a dollar. Rows of shoes were
piled by the skates as their owners whirled across the square or
struggled to keep their balance.
   Children whooped and laughed as they darted around on red bikes
decorated with picutres of Rambo brandishing a grenade launcher.
   ``There's nowhere to ride bikes at home so we can't have them,''
said one boy.
   Everywhere across the city of giant office buildings and clogged
streets people were enjoying their first breath of spring. They
strolled the sidewalks or stood on street corners watching the
world go by and chatting with friends.
   Sidewalk vendors offered chestnuts, hot potatos and dried squid.
Women with stoves on carts fried onion pancakes and stirred pots
simmering with noodles in red pepper sauce.
   ``Flowers, flowers,'' shouted other vendors offering the first
red, blue and yellow blooms from the warmer south. Pedestrians
stopped to inspect the bouquets and some brought a bunch to take
home.
   A few vendors sold imported bananas for the equivalent of $1.25
each. Imported fruit is classified as a luxury and heavily taxed.
   Hundreds of old men stood around in large groups or strolled at
Pagoda Park, one of the few parks in central Seoul. Some played a
board game called Jangi and bets were changing hands.
   Most of the retirees were dressed in Western suits, but a few
wore traditional Korean fur hats, snug silk jacks and long, loose
linen pantaloons.
   Sidewalk fortune tellers did a brisk business as people came to
ask if the spring would bring luck or if romance was in the offing.
   ``Many people come to know their fortunes for the year,'' said
an old fortune teller, sitting on a blanket surrounded by
astrological charts in Chinese and Korean.
   Asked for his name, he laughed.
   ``I'm 70 years old,'' he said, waving a visitor away.
