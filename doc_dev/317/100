   As congressional anti-subversive investigators began questioning
professors at nearby Temple University, young Dukakis joined and
soon became campus president of Students for Democratic Action. He
lobbied rural lawmakers to oppose a loyalty oath bill in the
Pennsylvania Assembly and, according to Victor Navasky, now editor
of the Nation Magazine, talked one out of every four schoolmates
into joining the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Sen. Joseph McCarthy's excesses had a great deal to do with my
seriously thinking about entering politics,'' Dukakis recently
recalled.
   In the election year of 1952, he was president of Students for
Stevenson, who by a healthy margin became the first Democrat to win
the campus straw vote. Although Republicans were ``thin on the
ground'' to test the Dukakis debating skills, Preston recalls a
bull session on the third floor of Wharton ``when someone mentioned
that Michael had it in him to go all the way, meaning the White
House.''
   Ted also remembers the spring of their junior year ``when
murmurs of real excitement ran through the dining hall as Jo-Jo
Black spread the word that her father, Justice Hugo Black, had just
telephoned news of the Supreme Court decision outlawing school
segregation. At Swarthmore, that was bigger than a World Series
result.''
   Swarthmore's liberalism rankled many of the neighbors in the
rest of Delaware County where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 8
to l.
   Dukakis recently recalled for an alumni group in Boston how the
conductor on the West Chester local always sang out as the train
approached the station before Swarthmore: ``Morton, the stop before
Moscow.''
   His admission to the honors program, which Swarthmore pioneered,
put him in the top eschelon of a remarkably brainy student body.
His campus contemporaries included Howard Tenin, a quiet member of
the wrestling team who would win a Nobel Prize in medicine; Carl
Levin, the future U.S. senator from Michigan; Rhodes scholar Frank
Sieverts, budding novelist Hugh Nissenson and future physicians Jon
Fine and Richard Burtis, his hitchhiking buddy on summer vacations.
   But the undergrad going wasn't all grind. There were midnight
sled rides down Parrish Hill on cafeteria trays. ``Freshman
Serenade,'' a fall fertility rite, erupted into a panty raid his
first year. The girls on the top floor of Parrish Hall defended
their lingerie by dumping wastebaskets of water on the male
marauders and inserting toilet plungers into the handles of the
dorm's double doors.
   Dean of Men Everett Hunt appeared out of the shadows to restore
order and was promptly deluged with a tub of sudsy laundry water.
``Proves the campus isn't completely lifeless,'' he sputtered
philosophically, taking to his bed with a bad case of chills.
   Next term the Poenix reported ``two gentlemen adventurers'' were
suspended for a week for scaling the college water tower ``and
engraving thereon fraternal Greek letters.''
   Then there was the outrageous Adlai hoax that brought reporters
and photographers swarming to the campus from the Philadelphia
dailies. At the beginning of the 1953 spring term, Swarthmore was
seeking a replacement for President John Nason, who was leaving to
head the Foreign Policy Association. Frank Irish, who ran with
Dukakis on the cross-country team, raced through the night to the
firm that printed the Phoenix and substituted a bogus front page
that proclaimed in tabloid-sized headlines ``Adlai Prexy!!''
   The story spuriously quoted outgoing president Nason, ``if our
students thought Mr. Stevenson would make a good president for the
country then he ought to be good enough for our college.''
   The administration was aghast and embarrassed, but Stevenson on
vacation in the Caribbean was amused and cabled his ``hope that the
college will not deal harshly with my beloved and youthful
friends.''
   Elected to Phi Betta Kappa, as well as president of the student
council, Dukakis was one of five in a class of 210 to graduate with
highest honors. He might have been and should have been president
of his graduating class. The yearbook shows him seated with
officers of the Class of '55, but shortly after it went to press,
Swarthmore, with characteristic egalitarianism, voted to abolish
all class officers.
   Now another Michael is the focus of attention at Swarthmore.
Mikhail Chkhenkeli, from Tblisi in Soviet Georgia, is among the
first of a glasnost coterie of Soviet students arriving at American
colleges.
   Mikhail fulfills a cultural exchange first proposed by the
student council when Michael Dukakis was its president.
