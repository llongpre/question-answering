   It was a homecoming for Harley-Davidsons
Saturday, and thousands of bikers came to party, swap stories and
share what they say is a special bond among ``hog'' owners.
   ``This is going to sound crazy, but I just kept patting my bike
all the way here, saying, `You're coming home,'' said Chuck Dungan,
a mechanic from Kansas City, Mo.
   Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson Inc., the country's only
motorcycle maker, called on bikers from across the United States
and Canada to come celebrate its 85th anniversary and raise money
to fight muscular dystrophy.
   By late Saturday afternoon, officials estimated 11,000 bikers
had arrived for the weekend event, which is expected to attract at
least 20,000 riders.
   Dungan said owners of hogs, as Harley-Davidsons are called,
share a bond with each other and the company.
   ``It just kind of gives you goose bumps,'' he said of the
gathering.
   ``If you ride a Harley, you've got an infinite home in
Milwaukee,'' said Bob Bunton, from Lakeland, Fla.
   At Waukesha County Technical College, bikers turned a parking
lot into a sea of black and red metal with glistening chrome.
   The riders included middle-age men with scruffy beards and
leather jackets, and couples toting 35 millimeter cameras. The vast
majority wore black T-shirts bearing the Harley-Davidson name.
   Dennis Hamon of Lake Tahoe, Calif., said his bike's transmission
once broke in Iowa, and another Harley-Davidson owner lent him new
equipment.
   ``Man, there's something about Harleys,'' he said. ``There's
more than a machine. Anytime you pull into a town and you see
Harleys, you know you have something in common.''
   Ruby Lovett, 59, of Worcester Mass., suffered a broken arm in
Syracuse, N.Y., but that didn't stop her and her husband from
completing their journey.
   ``I just had to go on,'' she said.
   One rider who sat quietly among the crowd was Pat Harley, whose
grandfather, William S. Harley, was one of the company's founders.
   ``I was riding before I could walk,'' Harley said.
   Harley sat on his bike, which had a sidecar that carried a
wheelchair. He said he was paralyzed in an accident over two
decades ago, but that didn't dent his enthusiasm.
   ``Just because you can't hold your bike up doesn't mean you
can't ride,'' he said.
   Most bikers gathered at the college or at another designated
spot in Kenosha County. Then they rode into Milwaukee's lakefront
and the festival grounds in groups of 50 to 100, watched by
hundreds of spectators who gathered at overpasses along the highway.
   Bikers gave a $10 donation to muscular dystrophy to get into the
weekend festival, which features music and carnival games, and
others were admitted for a donation of $14.
   Meanwhile, the nation's oldest motorcycle race was expected to
attract as many as 50,000 bikers to central New Hampshire over the
weekend.
   By late afternoon, about 25,000 bikers were in Weirs Beach, a
popular amusement area in Laconia in the state's Lakes Region, said
police Capt. Robert Babineau. Thousands of spectators and
motorcyclists packed Bryar Motorsport Park, where the Loudon
Classic and other motorcycle races were held.
   Babineau reported about 130 arrests in Weirs Beach, mostly for
disorderly conduct and motor vehicle violations. Numerous accidents
also were reported, all of them minor.
