<LEADPARA>  MONDAY'S WEEKLY obligations at the People's Republic of Berkeley prevent me
from attending a speech by Stanford Professor Robert Noll on Monday.;   I'm
still curious to hear what Noll says about the future of college sports in his
discussion on "The Economics of Sports" at the Senior Center of Palo Alto at 2
p.m.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TALK ON 'ECONOMICS OF SPORTS' INTRIGUES
STANFORD'S NOLL SHOULD HAVE MUCH TO SAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Sports  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Noll, who specializes in business policy, has examined sports economics for
20 years.;   College sports are unique; I become more absorbed and intrigued
by their operations than high school and professional sports. College sports
haven't reached the business-first attitude of virtually all professional
sports franchises.;   It says a lot for college sports when Stanford
basketball star Adam Keefe shunned the opportunity to turn professional and a
multimillion-dollar contract so he could spend quality time with his friends
during his senior year.;   In most cases, the athletes are students first. As
a reporter, you can see a more personable side of them. They have obligations
like any other person -- homework, laundry, to name a couple.;   THEN why am I
so interested in what Noll says?;   Because college sports are in trouble.;  
It's no secret that Stanford's athletic department was $1 million in the red
last summer, but that pales in comparison to the $3.2 million debt incurred by
UCLA, according to a survey conducted by the Seattle Times.;   Schools are
looking feverishly at ways to maximize their dollars spent while cutting back
wherever possible.;   Baseball programs smiled when their football teams would
recruit an athlete who could play both sports, such as Stanford's John Elway,
Toi Cook and Brian Johnson.;   Baseball may become more dependent on football
because the scholarship allotment for baseball programs has been cut from 13
to 11 3/4 full rides under new National Collegiate Athletic Association
rules.;   In most cases, football holds the meal ticket. The University of
Washington has capitalized on a winning football program to turn in a profit
of $5 million.;   Stanford athletic director Ted Leland has said an easier
non-conference schedule could ultimately result in more wins, more fans and
more money.;   THE CARDINAL has played an attractive schedule during the past
three seasons, but I didn't see cavernous Stanford Stadium shake the
resemblance to United States Football League crowds at many games.;   There
are other ways to save a buck. Visiting football teams usually stay in a hotel
the night before a game, regardless of the proximity. Two weekends ago, San
Jose State saved some money by not traveling to Berkeley to play Cal until the
morning of the game.;   Football isn't the only sport under scrutiny. The
minor sports are at stake, and are usually the first ones to be cut in the
event of a revenue shortage and/or cutbacks.;   This could become more common
around the nation should revenues diminish and/or expenses rise. Several minor
sports, including those at Stanford, exist from outside donations as well as
funds from the athletic department.;   But the last thing a coach wants to do,
outside of listening to a whining parent, is raise funds. Unfortunately, it
may come down to that.  </TEXT>
