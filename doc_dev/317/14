"Howdy and welcome, folks. It's time again for another fun-filled edition of 
'Full Ride,' the game show for parents who seek that all-important status 
symbol: the college scholarship! 
</P>
<P>
"OK, let's get started. 
</P>
<P>
"Parent No. 1, tell us what you've done to groom your son for a full ride." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, when our Johnny was born, we filled the nursery with all the important 
stimuli. You know, playbooks, goal posts, rolls of Astroturf. We even got his 
diapers autographed by Lou Holtz." 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooh, very nice. Very nice." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, then when he was 4, we took him to his first session with his sports 
psychologist. I mean, Johnny wasn't a wimp or anything, but, well, you know, 
any time his mother and I would sit him down to discuss pass plays he'd cry for 
his Winnie-the-Pooh videos." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes. That can be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, last year at Johnny's eighth birthday party, his exercise physiologist 
noticed he wasted far too much oxygen when he blew out his candles. From that 
moment on we've had him hold his breath on the way to practice." 
</P>
<P>
"To increase lung capacity?" 
</P>
<P>
"You got it. We figured if football didn't pan out we could always get him into 
underwater alligator wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
"Right. I heard that was a scholarship sport now in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, not yet, but we're working on it. Got lobbyists down there right now, as 
a matter of fact." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that expensive?" 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, what isn't? We've had Johnny work with sports nutritionists, 
astrologers, aerodynamic hairstyle specialists. Those footwork sessions with 
Paula Abdul weren't cheap, you know. Anyway, it'll all be worth it once he gets 
that full ride. I mean, I get tears in my eyes every time I envision him 
signing that letter of intent." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, sure. We all understand that feeling, don't we? OK, on to the next 
contestant. Go ahead, Parent No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, I think maybe I'm on the wrong stage." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean? This is 'Full Ride,' the show everyone wants to be on. Now 
go ahead, don't be shy. Tell us what you've done to get your kid a 
scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I just, uh, have him go to school and let him play sports, basically." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, stop kidding. What's your game plan? Who's your publicist?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, really. My son told me when he gets to high school, he'd like to try out 
for the gymnastics team, if they have one." 
</P>
<P>
"Gymnastics? Gymnastics! Come on, Parent No. 2, didn't anyone tell you that 
gymnastics is one of the fastest-fading college sports around? It's the dead 
end of scholarship street. For heaven's sake, haven't you attended even one 
scholarship-seeking seminar?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, see my son really enjoys gymnastics. He likes doing somersaults, just for 
fun, you see." 
</P>
<P>
"Fun? What does fun have to do with it? We're talking scholarships, here. You 
understand the significance of that? Get your kid a scholarship, mister, and 
your status skyrockets. We're talking a big piece of prestige pie. I mean, 
c'mon, it's the Orange County way." 
</P>
<P>
But is it the right way? No way. 
</P>
<P>
High school coaches in Orange County typically say the pressure on athletes 
has, in some cases, risen to ridiculous proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Earning a college scholarship is, in many areas, becoming more important than 
playing the sport. Sure, college is expensive and a scholarship can certainly 
help a family in need. There's nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
But when parents go to unreasonable lengths to increase their child's chances 
for a scholarship, the resulting pressure can interfere with the child's 
ability to perform and the enjoyment of the sport the child plays. 
</P>
<P>
And many times, you have to question the parents' motives. 
</P>
<P>
At Corona del Mar High, a parent of a wide receiver once called the coach's 
office requesting that her son be thrown more passes than usual in the upcoming 
game. Why? Because a Pac-10 recruiter said he would be in the stands that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
At Laguna Beach, parents of a volleyball player asked the coach if he could 
make sure their daughter was given more opportunities to spike than normal 
because they told a college coach they would videotape their daughter's next 
match so he could judge her ability. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hired a new girls' soccer coach," Corona del Mar athletic director 
Jerry Jelnick said. "One parent came out and his first question was, 'Does he 
know college coaches?' He didn't ask whether the guy knew soccer." 
</P>
<P>
The Times gets several calls each week from parents who are upset because their 
child hasn't gotten "enough press." Their complaint often comes down to this: 
</P>
<P>
"How's my son going to get a scholarship if no one knows about him?" 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are in the business of news, not public relations. Publicists now 
are making themselves available to high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But as with all the other ways a parent can "buy" a better chance for an 
athletic scholarship -- personal trainers, nutritionists, sports psychologists 
-- doesn't it make more sense to sock that money away in a college cookie jar 
in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
It might not be as prestigious as a scholarship, but the education will be paid 
for just the same.
