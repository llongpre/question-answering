ELENEA M. POST 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL SURFER, 18 
</P>
<P>
When her two older brothers gave up surfing with her because the water got too 
cold in the winter, Nea Post continued going to the beach on her own, dutifully 
riding her bike the few blocks to Huntington Beach so she could ride the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I started surfing when I was 13 by just tagging along with my brothers," Post 
said. "Then I decided that this is what I really wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
She quickly progressed. Post became a standout surfer on the Huntington Beach 
High School team and the top-seeded female surfer in the National Scholastic 
Surfing Assn., which has 4,000 members and sponsors contests for students 
attending grade school through college. 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, Post had won four national high school championships, 
several state championships and two open division contests for women held by 
the scholastic group. She placed fifth in the world amateur championships in 
Japan in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Now Post has decided to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of time in as a kid," Post said. "I stayed at the beach all day. I 
still try to surf for at least three hours a day, no matter what the 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Post attends Golden West College and has started the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals tour, the most competitive professional circuit. She is sponsored 
by Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd., Altra Surfboards of Newport Beach, Huntington 
Surf &amp; Sport, and Victory wet suits. 
</P>
<P>
She has made surf trips to Australia, Hawaii, Bali, Venezuela, Costa Rica, 
Barbados, Puerto Rico, Japan and Canada for a wave pool demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my reasons for doing it are pretty standard," Post said. "It's just so 
much fun. I don't get tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
And her brothers are very supportive, she said, adding, "You can never get too 
much support." DAN WEIKEL
