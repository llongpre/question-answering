   As a former Division III All-American football player who never received a free ride, I find Paul R. Lawrence's March 6 editorial-page piece "End Cheating -- Pay College Athletes" a joke. 
Not once did Mr. Lawrence, the author of a book on the NCAA, mention the word education. 
Isn't that supposed to be the real reason those kids are there? 
Athletic scholarships were conceived as the opportunity for a kid who couldn't afford school to attend. 
Great idea, right? 

   Sure collegiate athletics has turned into a business but keep the TV contracts with the administrators of the institutions. 
Let them use the money to advance curriculum and facilities instead of budgeting for athletic salaries. 

   Keep the system as it is -- amateur. 
Let college athletes wait four years before signing their million-dollar contracts. 
Who knows, maybe they'll learn something in school. 
Maybe these "millionaires to be" will be taught how to manage their finances through investment instead of through narcotics.

   A major incentive for cheating is the fact that it is not illegal for an athlete to accept under-the-table money. 
If someone gets caught, the school bears the punishment, not the guilty athletes themselves. 
If a college athlete knew that he would be ineligible to play professionally if he were caught accepting payments while in college, maybe he would think twice about the extra bucks in the first place. 
Granted, very few college athletes make the pro ranks, but many of those who do make it receive the money in college, and in turn generate the revenues for the college through higher attendance and increased television coverage. 

   I would rather see the return of true amateur athletics than continue to watch its evolution into big business. 
Shouldn't college athletes be students first?
