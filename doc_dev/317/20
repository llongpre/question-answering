   Deep cuts in state spending will mean larger
classes, closed schools, fewer teachers and fewer sports programs
for the 1 million students returning to Massachusetts public
schools and colleges next month, educators say.
   At the state's 29 public colleges and universities, students
will feel the effects of a $39.3 million cut in higher education
funding ordered by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. The 1,800 public
schools will have to shoulder their share of a $210 million
reduction in state aid to cities and towns.
   Educators use words like ``disaster,'' ``tragedy,'' and
``devastation'' to describe the impact.
   The governor, who touted his state's booming economy during his
unsuccessful presidential campaign last last year, only to be
blindsided by a surge in red ink this year, expressed deep regret
in announcing the cuts last month. But he said he had little choice
but to carve $491 million out of the state's 1989-90 budget.
   The cuts and the withholding of funds were needed to bring the
budget to $12.2 billion, in keeping with a balanced-budget
provision in the Massachusetts Constitution.
   Schools in communities small and large are feeling the pinch.
For example:
   _ Brockton is considering a plan to charge high-school atheletes
to take part in sports programs.
   _ The small central Massachusetts community of Belchertown may
begin making students pay to ride the school buses.
   _ Springfield will have to lay off at least 300 and possibly as
many as 800 teachers out of a faculty of 2,000 because of a severe
budget crisis in that city. All but a few athletic programs have
been cut including soccer, ice hockey and swimming, according to
Assistant Superintendent Ann Southworth.
   _ Some 8,000 college students _ most of whom would attended
community colleges, designed to serve the poorest sector of the
community _ will be turned away.
   ``It is a cruel blow to schools,'' state education Commissioner
Harold Raynolds Jr. said last week. ``There won't be a single
school across the commonwealth that is intact as it was last
spring.''
   Higher education Chancellor Franklyn Jenifer said that despite a
7.7 percent tuition increase and steep hikes in student fees, the
budget crisis has halted a push to advance the state's public
college and university system into the nation's top rank.
   ``We will at best be doing worse than we were last year, and
last year was a bad year,'' Jenifer said. ``We've taken the
position that one maintains quality at all costs. Access to
mediocrity is no access at all.''
   Higher education budget cuts will translate into 1,900 canceled
course sections for the 120,000 full-time students, Jenifer's staff
has calculated. Some 1,200 part-time faculty and staff positions
are being cut, and 8,000 student slots, most in community colleges,
were eliminated for the fall term.
   No one will be turned away from public elementary and secondary
schools. But because of faculty and staff cuts, some of the 824,000
public school students will be in bigger classes than before.
   Staff and faculty reductions at public schools across the state
are expected to reach 8,000, according to the Massachusetts
Teachers Association.
   In Boston, a parents group and the Boston Teachers Union have
gone to court to block a plan to close six public schools and
consolidate three others.
   ``Two years from now, people are going to be saying, `How come
our kids can't compete?''' said Rosanne Bacon, president of the
Massachusetts Teachers Union. ``We're unwilling to spend our money
on our kids. This is not the way they do things in Japan.''
