Virginia Romero rides a bike to get around the 140-acre Cerritos College campus 
and perform her job as athletic counselor. 
</P>
<P>
She uses the bicycle so she can move quickly to solve any academic problems 
involving the 545 student athletes at the school, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have to take a transcript to a coach to let him know immediately how a 
player is doing," Romero said. "I might want to talk with an athlete at the gym 
during a class break." 
</P>
<P>
Other times, Romero can be found huddled in her small, cramped space in the 
admissions office, counseling students or talking on the telephone with coaches 
or counselors from other colleges and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Romero is one of only 12 athletic counselors in the state's 107-community 
college system. She is the only one in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
The college's seven-member board of trustees appointed Romero to the athlete 
counseling job in August. "The board is committed to ensuring the success of 
our athletes as students," said Mark Wallace, director of public information. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said her job is to make sure athletes are taking the proper classes and 
maintaining a 2.0 grade-point average to graduate from the two-year school and 
transfer to four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"All students are special, but athletes need special attention to achieve as 
students and fulfill their athletic obligation," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
She said athletes need special attention because 90% of them work part time 
while carrying 15 units and practicing three to four hours daily in their 
chosen sport. 
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of months, Romero said she will be setting up a computerized 
program to keep track of the athletes' academic progress. She also plans to 
schedule workshops with high school coaches and counselors to prepare student 
athletes for the rigors of college life. 
</P>
<P>
Before Romero took her present position, she taught health and physical 
education classes at Cerritos College for 11 years. Previously, she coached 
high school athletics in the ABC Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
She attended Cerritos College and has a bachelor's degree in physical education 
from Cal State Long Beach. She also has a master's degree in counseling from 
Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>

Long Beach Unified in 1987 as a high school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Math instructor Lois Barth has taught at the 30,000-student college for more 
than 20 years on a part-time basis, while working full time as a junior high 
school math teacher in the Long Beach unified district. 
</P>
<P>
Art instructor Joan Binkoff joined the college in 1966. An art designer, 
Binkoff has exhibited her prints, photographs and drawings throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>

administrator in the Long Beach Unified School District. He was there for 36 
years, teaching woodworking and math at both the district and the college 
before going into administration.
