   Federally funded colleges and universities
would have to report graduation rates for student athletes and
others under a House-passed bill described as ``a consumer rights
bill.''
   The bill cleared the House on a voice vote Tuesday and was
returned to the Senate, which earlier approved a different version.
   Under the bill, federally supported institutions would have to
report to the Education Department their overall graduation rates,
student-athlete graduation rates, revenues from intercollegiate
athletics, campus security policies, campus crime statistics and
information about results of campus disciplinary hearings.
   The graduation rates would pertain only to fulltime,
degree-seeking students.
   ``It provides students with information which will assist them in
making decisions concerning college attendance and ... information
they need to protect themselves against becoming crime victims,''
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said.
   Much of the debate focused on provisions dealing with
intercollegiate athletics.
   Student athletes have a right to know whether a school will treat
them ``as chattel properties'' or as genuine students in need of
preparation for life beyond the playing field, said Rep. Paul Henry,
R-Mich.
   ``Sports are the top public relations vehicle for many colleges
and universities,'' Henry said. ``Thus, fielding winning teams
becomes to a very large extent the consuming purpose of athletic
programs. The better the team, the better the exposure, regardless
of the cost.''
   Reporting requirements recently set by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association are ``too limited,'' focusing only on the
big-money sports of football and basketball, said Rep. Ed Towns,
D-N.Y.
   ``Other sports must be covered as well,'' Towns said. ``If we can
report the on-time arrivals of airlines, surely we can let the
general public know whether or not students are getting a useful
degree at a university.''
   Too many high-school athletes dreaming of professional careers
enroll at major universities where they can't handle the academics,
said Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former college and NBA basketball
star.
   ``Unfortunately, most have a better chance of becoming a brain
surgeon than a professional athlete,'' he said. ``The dream is in
fact an impossible dream for most. We have a responsibility to these
young people ... to instill in them the concept that if they want to
punt on the field, they can't punt in the classroom.''
   ``It's a consumer rights bill for students,'' Goodling, who said
his interest, especially in the crime-statistics provision, arose
from the murder of Jeanne Clery, whose parents live in his district,
at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., in 1986.
   ``The truth is students are raped, assaulted and murdered on
college campuses,'' he said. The bill won't solve those problems but
``can ensure students are as aware of crimes on campus as you and I
are of crimes in our neighborhoods or in the cities where we work,''
he said.
