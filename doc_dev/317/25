Tanya Service recovered from a motorcycle spill on Monday to win the all-around 
on Saturday and help the Bruins gain their third straight UCLA-Times Women's 
Gymnastics Invitational title, thus moving from uneasy rider to easy glider in 
less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
She scored an invitational record 38.85 in the all-around, including another 
meet record of 9.85 on floor exercises, to keep Bruin dominance alive in this 
event. "Our first peak of the year," said UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who have won 23 straight dual meets but never an NCAA championship 
(third last year), had a team score of 190.95 points(another record) to easily 
beat Cal State Fullerton (188.2) and Arizona State (188.15). Georgia was fourth 
(187.50) and Stanford was fifth (183.65). 
</P>
<P>
For Service, who missed competing in the NCAA championships last year when she 
dislocated her elbow in the regionals, this week's developments were very 
encouraging. Usually when she gets injured, it is in competition. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was riding on the back of boyfriend (and UCLA men's gymnast) Mike 
Chaplin's motor scooter when they were rear-ended. "Lower back whiplash," she 
explained after the Pauley Pavilion meet. "It still hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Not that anybody noticed. College gymnastics best athlete never to win an NCAA 
title sailed through the meet, capping it off with a crisp floor exercise 
routine. Her record-breaking score was helped by teammate Shawn McGinnis, 
another oft-injured gymnast, who threw what was announced as college gymnastics 
first "full-in." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was the second. McGinnis had done the double-twisting double-back 
somersault in a dual meet with Cal State Fullerton. "But they weren't sure it 
was the first at the time," she said. "So I guess I'm still the first." 
</P>
<P>
Her routine earned her a 9.80, which tied the record. But it only stood for 
minutes until Service followed with hers, nothing as spectacular but possibly 
more polished. 
</P>
<P>
Service, who had won the all-around in this same meet two years ago with a 
record score of 38.60, beat Arizona State's Karli Urban (38.40) and teammate 
McGinnis (38.30). UCLA's Jill Andrews and Cal State Fullerton's Liso Dolan tied 
for fourth with 37.90. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said his team, which normally performs in the John Wooden Center, was 
a "little bit hyper" in its once-a-year Pauley Pavilion performance. "Our bars 
performance was hyperness," he said of some uneven scoring.
