It's too bad that Sue Sally Hale doesn't have to write an essay on "What I Did 
on My Summer Vacation." Not many people could top this Moorpark grandmother's 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who turns 53 this month, has just spent six weeks playing professional 
league polo in France where her team won eight of nine games to finish second 
overall in the Mallet of Gold tournament at the Polo Club de Bouloy. She also 
played in a women's promotional polo tournament at Deauville for Jacomo 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a trial by fire," said Hale, who is widely considered the Grand Dame of 
Women's polo in America. "I learned to do things that I didn't think I could do 
under the best conditions." Hale replaced her daughter, Sunny, who played for 
the first weeks of the tour but returned home to resume her duties as manager 
of the Glendale Polo Club near Chicago. Sunny had warned her mother that 
playing in France "was kind of different," adding that it might be fun, "but 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Hale confirmed that after a 20-hour flight, she found herself on a rock-hard 
field playing in games that she compared to a Monty Python event. This was 
unlike the game of strategy, which she has taught to many professional players 
and celebrities including Doug Sheehan and Parker Jamison. 
</P>
<P>
"Over there it seems that nobody knows where the ball goes. You just hit it and 
then run to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Hale said they also played on wet grass where a sudden turn at 30 m.p.h. could 
result in a fatal fall. "I was also scared to death driving a rig, with seven 
head and two trailers, 9,000 m.p.h. down those tiny roads," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades Hale has been a pioneer in developing American 
women's polo into a recognized competitive sport, now played at several college 
campuses and equestrian clubs around the country. The latest figures of the 
United States Polo Assn.'s membership reveal 418 female members. Only 350 women 
are players with an assigned handicap, another 55 are unrated students, and 28 
are non-playing associates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, when Hale was one of the first three women officially admitted to the 
century-old USPA, she was then rated the top woman player in the nation. She 
had a "two goal" handicap, which she now shares with only a handful of women. 
She has been the subject of several magazine and newspaper articles and her 
achievements have earned her a place in the Smithsonian Institution's section 
on Women in Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Hale and two of her daughters teach and play polo professionally. 
Twenty-one-year-old Sunset (Sunny) shares the highest indoor and outdoor rating 
for U.S. women players with her sister Stormie, and two others. Stormie, who is 
25 and the mother of Sue Sally's 10-month-old granddaughter Victoria, runs the 
family's H and H Farms. According to Stormie, their Moorpark Polo Club, 
established in 1986, is "currently the only teaching club in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Bob McConihay, a former student and a contractor from Newbury Park, said that 
"Sue Sally's place makes it possible for the average person with only one horse 
to come out and play weekend polo without owning a string of ponies and 
equipment. And you play safe here." 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown up with horses," said Stormie, who also trains polo ponies. "I 
remember when we were kids living in Carmel Valley, a lot of nights we'd sneak 
out and sleep in the barn with our ponies." 
</P>
<P>
Their equestrian enthusiasm comes from their mom. Hale showed me an ardent note 
she had written to her mother at 12 vowing to become "a bronc buster or a polo 
player." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up like a wild Indian in the hills of Hollywood," said Hale, whose 
stepfather, actor-stuntman Richard Talmadge, became her mentor after her 
father's death. While attending Westlake School for Girls with celebrities 
including Jane Fonda and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria, she occupied herself 
with swimming and riding. As a preteen, she qualified for the Olympics in 
swimming but chose to concentrate on riding. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, under the tutelage of polo greats Duke Coulter and C.D. LeBlanc, she 
played with men's teams at the now-defunct Riviera Country Club and at Will 
Rogers State Park. 
</P>
<P>
She would disguise herself as a boy by applying mascara to her upper lip, 
wearing a loose shirt and tucking her braids under her helmet. "After a game," 
said Hale, "it was a kick to clean up for the parties and mingle unrecognized 
with the guys I'd just played on the field with." 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Hale began applying for USPA membership, something she did annually 
until succeeding in 1972. "I had been teaching men to play polo for years," she 
said, "and I wanted to play on the field with them in official tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Hale married Alex Hale in 1957 and moved to the Monterey Peninsula where sons 
Brooke and Trails, and daughters Stormie, Sunset and Dawn were born. In 1963 
she established the Carmel Valley Polo Club, the first such club on the 
peninsula since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching riding and polo, Hale taught horse management and riding at 
Monterey Peninsula Community College, and wrote articles for the local 
newspaper and for national horse and polo magazines. She also became an 
emergency medical Technician and received commendations for her work as a 
volunteer firefighter. An accomplished artist, Hale majored in illustration and 
cartooning in college and has won several poetry contests. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Hale led her team to win the first USPA-sanctioned Women's Western 
National Polo Tournament. Ten-year-old Sunny played on the team as the youngest 
member of the USPA along with Stormie, who was 14. 
</P>
<P>
Never one to rest on her laurels, Hale is already scouting a sponsor for a 
women's team from Ventura County to compete in the U.S. Women's Open, which 
will be held in December at the Empire Polo Club in Indio. The four-woman team 
will consist of the three Hale women and Carolyn Anier, the highest rated woman 
player in France. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Open, Hale, as usual, will play "reality" not "posh" polo, 
driving her own horse trailer and sleeping under the stars during the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
And whether she is playing with men or with women, Hale adheres to a very 
strict code of ethics. She avoids rude language, keeps commitments and always 
plays fairly, safely and honestly. To prove that women players are reliable, 
she played through all five pregnancies and even finished a game after she had 
broken her leg. 
</P>
<P>
She considered it a compliment when an opponent once remarked, "There's one 
thing worse than death -- Sue Sally Hale."
