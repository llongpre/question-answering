<LEADPARA>  IN "Pardon Me for Living," a grade school hero courts the new nerdish girl at
school, with the line, "Pardon me for living, mind if I walk you home? Pardon
me for living, anything in the way of sandwich around here?";   To gain
acclaim for himself, the hero sets her up to get in trouble with the school
principal. At the conclusion of the movie, he comes to his senses. He rides up
on a golden Palomino, reaches down his hand and lifts her up, saying in
effect: "A true friend is someone who will ride back to get you."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A REAL FRIEND RIDES BACK FROM THE SUNSET  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The line stuck in my memory ever since my sister, a seventh-grade English
teacher, first told me the story. I wondered what people in my life would ride
back for me, when I needed a lift. Who would reach back and grab my hand?;  
Once, I wanted a man to ride back in his green Peugeot and save me, from
myself. I had abruptly broken off a four-year romance with him that ranged
from hot to cool and later regretted it. But riding back didn't happen. He
drove off to New York and I to California.;   By not "saving" me, he taught me
a valuable lesson: Take the initiative when it comes to matters of the heart. 
A couple of years later when Bill rode abruptly in and out of my life during a
one-month period, I didn't keep silent. When he called me from Tennessee to
tell me he was headed for California, asking me to pack his belongings in his
apartment for shipping, I risked to tell him how much I cared.;   It was a way
of riding back, not letting an important person slip from my life. That was 18
years and a marriage ceremony ago.;   Over the years, I've ridden back into
people's lives and I haven't let them ride so easily out of mine.;   Except,
this old college flame in the green Peugeot. I didn't want to ride back in,
concerned that maybe I would be an intrusion.;   I simply held to the fantasy
that the love of my college life would stride to the doorstep on a day when my
house was spotless and make an entry.;   Margo Zanzinger of Union City
probably kindled the fantasy, by recounting the day her college flame from
Florida appeared suddenly at her door.;   "You want to look like a million
dollars and that everything is wonderful," she said. "Here I was completely
yellow. I had hepatitis. I was afraid to even invite him in, for fear that he
would become infected.";   Her husband Jerry, hepatitis-ill too, was inside
wondering what was going on as the two of them sat outside on the steps
talking.;   I'm not exactly sure why I've held the fantasy, perhaps to say
that I had meant something to him, as much as he had meant to me, that I was
worth the ride back.;   Dave, my college flame, was by my side for a lot of
firsts. He held my hand for my first airplane ride. He wrapped his arms around
me at my first rock concert.;   Sometimes he wasn't beside, but behind,
pushing me forward. He guided me through my struggle to become editor of the
college newspaper, and amid sky-rocketing long distance phone bills from
Chapel Hill to Rock Hill he coached me every step of the way to becoming
student body president.;   For three years, he was my cheerleader. Through his
eyes, I could see possibilities for myself that when I looked in the mirror
were not there. He exuded enough confidence for us both. The entry came last
week, not at the door, but by phone. A roomful of 6-year olds were screaming
as "Lolly by Golly," the clown, performed a magic show for my daughter's sixth
birthday.;   Closer to the phone, Bill, stepped over little hands and feet in
our family room to answer the call.;   Hours later he remembered that Dave
called. I scanned my memory of the past week, came up with a Dave from a story
I had worked on and concluded it was he. But in my heart, I still held out
hope that it was a Dave I had known long ago.;   When he called again -- this
time as dinner guests were just sitting down at our table -- I arranged to
call him back.;   In San Francisco for a broadcasters' convention, he had
decided to call, with a little urging from his wife, Mary, who dialed the
number for him and handed him the phone. He had Sunday free since Mary was
flying out that morning to return to a new job she had just started.;   When a
flame comes to the door, there's no time to discuss it with a spouse.
Telephones give warnings. Bill and I talked over the visit. Though he was a
little apprehensive, he was a prince of a guy, saying invite Dave for dinner.;
  Dave arrived late, having missed connections by first taking a BART train to
Daly City, then catching the mistake and heading for Oakland and a connecting
train to Fremont. When he called to tell me he would be late, my mind flashed
to the time he left me sitting in a bus station for five hours, a combination
of the crazy hours he worked and exhaustion.;   As we sat talking in the
living room, kids raced in and out.;   We discussed the expectations we had
for the day. Both of us admitted to nervousness and excitement.;   Though I
felt some emotions bleed from the past into the present, we didn't pick up
where we left off. We picked up as two old friends with common interests.;  
We spent so much time catching up on the past, that I learned little about his
current daily life. I wish I had listened more and talked less to learn the
events that have most shaped him in the past 20 years.;   He gave me a chance
to say some things I had wanted to over the years, not as eloquently as I
might, but I think he understood how important he had been in my development.;
  He didn't recall the day I had steeled myself, before walking into a
restaurant to tell him I didn't love him. I knew I was lying, but the
chemistry between us was building to a crescendo, a step I was in conflict of
taking. I loved him, yet my mother's opposition to our relationship weighed
heavy. I felt pulled by both of them, with my own ambivalences in between.;  
Though he labels his recall-failure as a defense, I choose to see it as
forgiveness, a decision somewhere long ago to savor the good and let the
painful slip away.;   By riding back, he gave me a chance to revisit a part of
myself and look again at my pattern of pleasing others at the cost of not
being true to myself.;   As I sat sobbing a couple of days after his visit,
not really sure what the tears were about, I figured I was mourning the loss
of my youth and the loss of a more spontaneous side of myself that I have kept
imprisoned all these years for fear that left unattended it will create
disaster. Or minimally, make me look foolish.;   Mid-life seems the time to
re-examine my approach of bedrock reliance on my will to overpower my
emotional and spontaneous sides, keeping them sequestered.;   By riding back,
Dave gave me a chance once again to look through his eyes, to see someone
worth the ride back, something I've struggled with of late.;   He is exactly
what I thought all along, a true friend.;   Maybe someday I'll get to return
the favor.  </TEXT>
