<TEXT>     They were found in a crumpled four-wheel-drive vehicle that was in flames
and upside down in a creek bed in the vicinity of Chimay Way and Falls Creek
Drive, San Jose police said.;   The mother of one of the boys said the four
were taking a quick off-road jaunt on their way to a restaurant.;   The youths
died from burns, and smoke and fume inhalation, said Administrative Coroner
Nathan Gossett.;   "This should have never happened to these boys," said a
weeping Debbie Cepeda as she recalled the vivaciousness of the youths and her
son, Jesse.;    "Sweet, sweet, sweet," she said, describing Jesse. "He was a
sweet boy and very sensitive.";   The teens had all lived within blocks of
each other in the Evergreen district and attended the same schools, she said.;
  Jesse and Christopher, who attended Bellarmine College Preparatory, had
recently visited New Orleans for a Police Athletic League-sponsored football
competition, Debbie Cepeda said. Jesse had won an award for his defensive
play.;   Three became four;   Jesse, Christopher and Jason became pals at
Evergreen Elementary School seven years ago, she said. The trio became a
quartet when they met Edwin at Quimby Oak Junior High.;   News of Edwin's
death stunned his teammates, said Oak Grove basketball coach Rich Young, who
canceled a practice session Thursday. "The players really took it hard," Young
said. "He was a very likable, young man.;   "He was just a great kid, fun to
be around. Always happy-go-lucky . . . and a very humble young man.";   Edwin
-- who played center in basketball and linebacker in football -- had hoped to
play collegiate sports, Young said. And the 6-foot-6-inch, 215-pound boy "had
the skills -- no doubt about it," Young said.;   Edwin transferred from Silver
Creek High School to Oak Grove at the beginning of the school year. Jesse
enrolled at Oak Grove in November after leaving Silver Creek High, and Jason
attended Silver Creek High, said Debbie Cepeda.;   Friends and relatives of
Jason and Christopher could not be reached for comment Thursday.;   Fire in
creek bed;   Debbie Cepeda said the youths began their final get-together by
going for a Christmas night ride into the East San Jose hills on their way to
a pizza parlor. They were in a four-wheel-drive vehicle that belonged to
Christopher, she said.;   "They just wanted to take (the vehicle) up there . .
. for a fast ride and come back down," she said.;   About 8:30 p.m., a
passerby flagged down a San Jose patrol officer to report a fire in the Yerba
Buena Creek bed in the foothills north of Evergreen Community College.;   When
he found a large, American-made four-wheel-drive vehicle in flames, the
officer called the fire department. The vehicle was upside down in the dry
creek bed off a dirt road, with a swath of burning grass around it.;   Once
the blaze was extinguished, firefighters spotted the bodies inside the truck.;
  Jaws of Life;   "It was not a pretty sight," said San Jose police traffic
investigator Ed Conway. "They had to use the Jaws of Life to pry open the
wreckage to get them out. The coroner said that, from their positions and
postures, the two in the back seat might have been conscious after the crash
but were trapped and couldn't get out.";   Conway said firefighters believe
the blaze erupted after the crash, in which the vehicle flipped over and
landed upside down.;   "The gas line was punctured in a couple of places,"
Conway said. "From the extent of the damage, the vehicle went off the road at
a pretty good clip, though I'm not prepared to say how fast it was going.";  
Although the nearest residence is three-quarters of a mile away, Conway hopes
someone may have witnessed the accident. He described the remote spot as one
frequented by neighborhood youths.;   "It's one of those secret places in a
grove of trees near an abandoned house, where kids can go out of sight of
adults, play music and talk," he said.  </TEXT>
