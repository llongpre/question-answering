   A dangerous game called ``elevator
surfing,'' blamed in the death of a college freshman, has been a
problem for years in high-rise buildings, officials say.
   Also called ``elevator action'' or ``piloting an elevator,'' the
hazardous sport involves climbing atop elevator cars _ either
through trapdoors in the roof or by jamming doors open _ and riding
on the roofs.
   ``We've taken it terribly seriously. We've been fighting it for
a long time,'' said Val Coleman, public information director for
the New York City Housing Authority.
   Coleman worked on a recently released cautionary videotape on
the issue called ``Children are Too Young to Die.'' There have been
10 deaths and more than 50 injuries reported in New York during the
past five years, he said.
   At the Otis Elevator Co., the largest elevator manufacturer in
the United States, officials have been concerned about the
dangerous game for some time, said Michael Jordan-Reilly, spokesman
for the Hartford, Conn.-based company.
   ``This is one of our major concerns,'' he said.
   Susan Beckett, a student at the University of Massachusetts,
told the campus newspaper, The Collegian, that students ride atop
elevators ``usually on the weekends when people are drunk.''
   At Ms. Beckett's school, 18-year-old Joel Mangion of Newton was
found dead Sunday at the bottom of an elevator shaft. Friends said
he had been jumping from one car to another in the double shaft.
   About a year ago, a student suffered serious injuries after
falling 30 feet in an elevator shaft, university officials said. In
the early 1970s, a student died after riding in a chair tied to the
bottom of an elevator car.
   Joseph Zannini, executive director of housing at the university,
said he has heard of the game occasionally during his 25 years in
college administration.
   ``There's so many unfortunate ways that young people sometimes
lose their lives because they just don't think,'' he said.
   Jordan-Reilly said the problem has probably existed ``as long as
there have been elevators and as long as there have been people who
want to try something dangerous.''
   In Bridgeport, Conn., police and firefighters spent two tense
hours in January rescuing a 13-year-old girl who was wedged between
an elevator car and the shaft after she slipped and fell off the
roof of the car in a public housing shelter. Police said the girl
and her sister were playing on top of the elevator.
   Donald A. Robinson, director of environmental health and safety
for the Massachusetts school, said officials are looking for new
ways to discourage elevator surfing.
   ``The message needs to be made very clear how elevators should
be used and not misused and to really emphasize the obvious
significant consequences,'' he said.
