   Robert J. Barro argues, quite correctly, that the NCAA
monopoly helps condemn ghetto athletes to continued poverty
("Let's Play Monopoly," editorial page, Aug. 27). As those
athletes report to campus, someone should post copies of the
Barro article. Better still, someone should give them copies
of Howard Fast's "Spartacus" to read -- or videotapes of the
Kirk Douglas spectacular.
   Once they've absorbed this tale of a gladiators' revolt,
they could make a simple announcement -- no intercollegiate
games will be played until the TV networks' sports
departments deposit 50% of their gross revenues in the
athletes' collective bank account. College authorities
probably will respond by trying to field teams composed of
actual students. But college coeds, having completed their
assigned reading of "Lysistrata," will stop that ploy easily
by refusing to date any scab athletes. And under this new
world order, there will be no further need for pious reports
proposing ways to reform college athletics.

   Mr. Barro seems to have missed the NCAA's purpose, which
is not only to facilitate competitive collegiate sports but
to provide players with scholastic enrichment as a way to
improve their lives. He doesn't recognize that the school
gives something back to the student-athlete -- namely, an
education. When this issue is considered, the assertion that
the colleges are the only benefactors in the situation is
proved false.
   Furthermore, the NCAA does not have monopoly power over
the arguments of why a student should not be paid to play
collegiate sports; it is we the public, who can determine and
assess the issues and decide what is right or wrong.
   Now, if Mr. Barro had examined the monopoly power of the
NCAA's rules enforcement committee. . . .
