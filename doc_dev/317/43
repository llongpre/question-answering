<LEADPARA>  "A lot of what I do, I consider normal, like riding my bike. Other people
don't think so, but I do," says Mathew Birskovich.;    Being able to ride a
bike at age 14 is not usually a challenge, but Matthew has been blind since
birth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mathew's courage to surmount obstacles presented by a disability was
recognized in May by Timpany Center, a therapy center dedicated to providing
services to the disabled community in Santa Clara County.;    The center held
its first Celebration of Courage on May 21 to honor six disabled youths and
adults, with a "Laurel." The Laurel award, designed by artist/designer Laurel
Burch, is a symbol of recognition for the courage with which honorees meet
personal challenges.;    Others honored are Donna Yeager, Theresa Vogel, Darcy
McCann, Aaron Morrow and Connie-Curry Lawrence.;    Disabled Programs Inc.
also was honored. The business provides education, training and employment in
computer programming for physically disabled individuals. Graduates have gone
on to successful computer careers.;    The honorees have this in common: They
have inspired others, and they don't consider themselves handicapped.;   
"There's not that much different about being blind," Mathew said. "You just
can't see what you want to.";    Mathew is one of the few blind children in a
regular school program. He enters Bellarmine College Preparatory High School
in the fall with a straight A average.;    Darcy McCann has cerebral palsy, a
disorder characterized by defective motor ability. She is a 12-year-old
decorated Girl Scout who enjoys swimming, horseback riding and sitz skiing in
competition and in leisure. Darcy, who uses a wheelchair, is a young panelist
for GRASP, Gaining Respect and Awareness by Sharing Problems and Progress, a
responsibility that has her speaking to schools countywide about her
disability.;    Aaron Morrow, 14, also has cerebral palsy, which didn't stop
him from becoming one of the most active leaders on the Sylvandale Middle
School Campus before he graduated from eighth grade. He volunteered for the
job of welcoming new students and acquainting them to the school.;    Adult
honoree Connie Curry-Lawrence, an albino, was admitted into an institution as
a child. During her childhood she was not associated with "normal children."
As an adult, she worked hard to overcome the trauma she experienced as a
child. She now owns her own business, Balloonatics, which has been operating
under her management for nine years.;    "Balloons make me happy, they only
bring joy to other people's lives with their color and beauty. That's what I
want to bring to others, happiness," Curry-Lawrence said. Lawrence is also the
co-founder of White Rainbow, the first national society of albinos.;    Vogel
and Yeager were also recognized as inspiring adults by Timpany Center.;   
Vogel was born without hands, her arms extend to just below her elbows and her
legs extend to her knees. With multiple operations and prostheses, physical
pain has been a part of Vogel's life. Improvising has been her way of
accomplishing ever day activities. "Normal," to Vogel is a full and active
life that includes traveling, camping, sports and social activities.;   
Yeager was born a quadruple amputee, with feet attached almost at hip level.
Every week, Yeager produces a cable television show, "On the Move." Through
interviewing and featuring people and activities geared toward the disabled
community, Yeager inspires other disabled people to lead complete and
fulfilling lives.;    The next Celebration of Courage will be May 19, 1992.  </TEXT>
