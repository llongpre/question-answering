<LEADPARA>  Exactly one decade ago, in the midst of a mundane graduation speech to a
sixth-grade class in East Harlem, Eugene Lang heard himself make this offer:
Stay in school, and I'll pay your college tuition.;    On Monday, Lang, a
71-year-old industrialist and multimillionaire, and the class he adopted
return to the school for a 10th reunion at which they will toast the first two
of the original students to receive college bachelor's degrees.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's sort of a sentimental journey," Lang said Friday.;    Lang's unique
form of adoption has been institutionalized in the I Have a Dream Foundation,
which supports similar programs for disadvantaged students in 41 cities. He
has been mythologized as the businessman who succeeded where educators
failed.;    "Anybody else could have done it," he said in an interview at the
headquarters of Refac Technology Development Corp., which he heads. "I did
it.";    Seven of the 61 students in the class moved away or otherwise dropped
out of sight. Of the remaining 54, 45 have obtained either a high school
degree or the equivalent. Thirty-two of them have gone on to college -- 19 to
four-year schools, 13 to community colleges.;    By local standards, the
class's high school graduation rate is extraordinary.;    P.S. 121 is the
school from which Lang himself graduated 63 years ago. He was speaking there
on June 25, 1981, when he realized his fine words about staying in school and
going to college were wasted on pupils in a district with a 60 percent dropout
rate.;    So he made his impromptu promise, and almost immediately saw it
would not be enough. The principal told Lang that, given the impoverished
neighborhood's many problems, only one or two students would ever take him up
on his offer.;    "In that case, I realized, I hadn't made much of an offer,"
he said.;    Lang, accordingly, arranged for tutoring and counseling for the
students, and tried to build their morale and develop their confidence.;   
Although it has been estimated that Lang has lavished close to $300,000 on the
P.S. 121 class, he said, "I don't know how much I've spent. I never started to
count.";    The money, he said, was the least of it. He helped get a student
who was convicted of armed robbery released early from prison, and found him a
job. When a student at Hunter College was unable to get into a remedial
reading course, Lang called the college president. When an unmarried boy
dropped out to support his child, Lang helped him get the job he still holds.;
   One day Lang piled five students into his car and drove them upstate to the
bucolic campus of Bard College. On the ride back, they all said they wanted to
go to Bard; one of them, Zulma Hernandez, actually did. When she graduated May
25, Lang was there.  </TEXT>
