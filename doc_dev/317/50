<HEAD>Poll: Pressure for Success in Sports Harms Colleges' Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College presidents and deans say that pressure
for success and financial rewards in sports interferes with the
educational mission of America's schools, a poll released Tuesday
showed.
   U.S. News &amp; World Report said 85.7 percent of college presidents
and deans participating in the poll agreed that ``the pressure for
athletic success and for financial rewards in intercollegiate
sports today has reached a level where it is interfering with the
prime educational mission of America's colleges and universities.''
   About 10 percent disagreed and 4.1 percent had no opinion.
   The poll was conducted more than four months ago, and just 60
percent of the 3,900 college officials contacted responded to the
survey. It is part of the magazine's 1990 ``America's Best
Colleges'' issue that will go on sale next week.
   Other survey results:
   _95 percent said that high school graduates being recruited for
a school's athletic team should be required to meet the same
admissions standards as all other students, while 5 percent said
the standards should be lower.
   _70.6 percent said athletes tend to be channeled into less
academically demanding courses, 28.7 percent disagreed and 0.7
percent had no opinion.
   _75.1 percent felt the sale or distribution of illegal drugs on
campus among athletes is about the same as it is among other
students, 21.6 percent said it is lower among athletes and 3.3
percent said it is greater among athletes.
   _74.5 percent said that incidents of crime, violence and sexual
attack were about the same among athletes as among other students,
10.7 percent said greater among athletes and 14.8 percent said
lower among athletes.
