   In a battle of lightning-fast minds, a team from
North Carolina State prevailed as students from 16 universities
tested their memories in the national College Bowl championship.
   ``One might think of College Bowl players as eggheads, but
eggheads are the worst College Bowl players,'' said Don Reid, who
created the game 35 years ago.
   ``The best players in a College Bowl game will eventually be the
players in the game of life,'' said Reid, who attended the weekend
event.
   Dan Petrus, a 24-year-old veterinary student at N.C. State,
helped his team capture the victory by answering this question:
``In a February 1988 poll of its readers by Rolling Stone, he was
voted worst male singer and worst dressed, and creator of the worst
album and worst single _ in other words, really and truly Bad.''
   The answer: ``Michael Jackson.''
   One of the questions in the final match between N.C. State and
Emory University was: ``On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, he
works from 9 to 5; on Wednesdays, from 9 to 1; and on Fridays until
early afternoon. During working hours, he often takes two or three
hours to read and answer his fan mail.''
   Emory's Mike Barkin, a 25-year-old law school graduate, pushed
his buzzer and yelled, ``President Reagan,'' before the moderator
finished reading the question.
   That was right, according to journalist Bob Woodward's recent
book about former CIA chief William Casey. But it wasn't good
enough to win the national College Bowl title.
   Other questions during the two-day event held at the Chicago
campus of the University of Illinois dealt with subjects ranging
from chemistry to the ``Wizard of Oz.''
   Petrus, a rugby player, said he's good at the game because, ``I
remember a lot of facts and I'm able to recall them quickly.''
   But Petrus said it takes practice to perform well in the College
Bowl, so his team trains four hours a week.
   The College Bowl started on national radio in 1953, and then
became a regular television show in 1959. The game is still shown
periodically on U.S. television and is broadcast in 12 foreign
countries, Reid said.
   Reid, a former basketball star, said he thought up the game
because he felt, ``there has to be some way to have fun with a
sport of the mind.''
   The championships began Saturday with four-man teams from 16
colleges answering a moderator's questions with various point
values in a series of rounds. Each team was paired with another and
had to accumulate more points than the other to win the round and
eliminate the loser from the competition.
   No prizes were awarded to participants, but Petrus said the
reward of beating teams from colleges such as Princeton University,
the University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Cornell University ``is knowing that you've been able to think
faster and out-think the others _ it's an ego thing.''
