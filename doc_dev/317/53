<LEADPARA>  Foothill College athletic officials are fastening their seat belts for an
unpredictable ride this summer.;    They're bracing themselves for next year's
state budget, scheduled to be released July 1. As they scrutinize their purse
strings, there's a recent financial concern that shocked Foothill-De Anza
Community College District officials.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The district found out it needs to trim $7 million from this year's budget
after an audit revealed a shortfall. This discovery forced officials from
Foothill and De Anza to take a microscopic look at their budgets and trim
where applicable.;    Foothill women's soccer coach Andrew Moore confirmed
that he couldn't purchase new uniforms with district money until the new
budget is released.;    Foothill women's athletic director Elaine Rotty, a
former volleyball coach, expresses loyalty to her troops.;    "We were funded
appropriately this year," Rotty said. "We're committed to make it through this
season. We've asked coaches to cut any and all additional expenses. We'll hold
fund-raisers and do whatever it takes.";    While Rotty seemed optimistic, she
also presented a realistic view of the 1990-'91 sports year.;    "We were
really fortunate to have gotten as far as we did. Our swim team will go on to
conference and state competition. Thank goodness the state meet will be held
at De Anza. And the tennis championships will be held at Chabot College (in
Hayward).";    There's a wild card in the upcoming state budget. It's the
status of Proposition 98, the 2-year-old initiative guaranteeing schools and
community colleges 40 percent of the state budget. The proposition has been
suspended by Gov. Pete Wilson.;    "On July 1, we will be at the whim of the
governor," Rotty said.;    Foothill, like every other community college in the
entire state, is bracing itself for that day.;    It's an ominous time for an
athletic department trying its best to upgrade its programs. Last fall,
Foothill's football program won its first football title in 33 years, and
Rotty hired respected high school coach Liz Santie to head the Owls' women's
volleyball program.;    The men's tennis team remains strong and Moore said
the financial uncertainty won't diminish his efforts to bring a state title to
Foothill.;    But it may be necessary to tap other resources for financial
support.;    "If it means fund-raising, we'll be very creative," Rotty said.; 
  Although football coach Gene Scattini said he received assurances his
program won't suffer cutbacks, Moore fears losing assistant Kim Smith. He
certainly doesn't relish the possibility, which he lists as a 50 percent
chance, of supervising 25 to 30 players during practice.;    Moore expressed
faith in his bosses and the future of the department but warned the cutting of
assistants would place tremendous demands on all coaches.;    Baseball coach
Al Talboy recalled how resourceful community college baseball coaches have
become during his 24 seasons.;    He talked about the switch from wood to
aluminum bats during the 1970s, which allowed coaches to save money or address
other financial necessities.;    When teams wanted to distinguish road and
away uniforms but could no longer afford gray and white sets, they bought
white and colored jerseys to match their white pants. This saved teams an
entire set of pants.;    Second baseman Frank Quadro appreciated the cleats
the Owl players buy for a reasonable price and their bright red jerseys, which
look newer than their two years.;    Talboy points out that his program is
funded by three sources -- Foothill's athletic department, student funds and a
trust fund used often for covering other expenses, such as room and board for
a weekend trip to Susanville.;    Talboy said he provides some of the extras,
such as a radar gun and a camcorder, for his players.;    The baseball team
sold gift coupon books last fall. The money was placed in the trust fund,
which then was used toward covering costs of the Susanville trip.;    Catcher
Trevor Shields, wearing the school's top-flight gear prior to a game last
week, was asked what would happen if the programs received no funding from the
school.;    "This would probably be just like summer baseball. We'd be wearing
our own uniforms and bringing our own equipment."  </TEXT>
