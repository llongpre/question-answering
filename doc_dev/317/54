   More than 4,000 students outfitted with a
map of an amusement park, a few instruments and a questionnaire
spent a day riding roller coasters and other contraptions to learn
more about physics.
   Students from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan participated in
the Cedar Point amusement park's fourth annual Physics Day.
   Tuesday's event allowed students to experience some of the
concepts they are studying, including gravity, acceleration, and
centrifugal force.
   ``The rides show how our physics equations relate to real
life,'' said Andre Takacs, an eighth grader from Midview Junior
High School in Lorain County. ``If it wasn't for physics, there
wouldn't be roller coasters.''
   Some answers were harder to obtain than others because rain kept
many rides closed.
   ``It would be a lot easier to measure the speed of the Blue
Streak (roller coaster) if I was on it,'' said Angela Kabasan of
Midview.
   Instead of wondering whether they could scream the loudest and
raise their arms on the downhill, students were busy figuring the
gravitational pull exerted on them by the new Magnum XL-200, which
the park bills as the world's tallest, fastest roller coaster.
   Physics Day has been recognized as a valid educational activity
by the American Association of Physics Teachers, said Robert
Speers, an associate professor at Firelands College and originator
of the Physics Day program.
