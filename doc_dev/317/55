<LEADPARA>  For Cheryl Carter every day is game day.;   Although it's been more than 10
years since Carter competed at the intercollegiate level as a tennis player at
California State University, Hayward, she is not far from the playing fields
and courts these days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Carter, a counselor at Ohlone College, drew up the blueprints for a class
that teaches the collegiate student-athlete how to cope with the everyday
stresses accompanied with being a jock on campus and what comes after the
cheering stops.;   She also teaches the course, called College Survival
Techniques for Student Athletes, at Ohlone.;   "So far the response has been
great," said Carter, 34. "I teach the athletes everything from how to study
and take notes to preparing for life after athletics. The (college's) board
was very receptive to the idea when I presented it.";   Only a week into the
1991-'92 school year, Carter's class is filled to its 30-person limit.;  
"It's something that has always interested me," said Carter, who was a
stand-out tennis player at El Cerrito High before her collegiate days. "Since
my days in college I've been thinking about designing this type of course.";  
Carter got the idea for such a class at Cal State.;   "I noticed my teammates
and myself having trouble once eligibility was over," said Carter, who
envisions her class expanding to two or three per semester in the future.
"With this class I hope to let athletes know of other careers, related to
athletics, that are available to them. Not everyone can be a professional
athlete. This class gives them different options.";   Along with the obvious
professions available in the sporting world -- athletic trainer and coach --
Carter teaches the athletes there are other avenues to be taken for those
interested.;   "I let them know about jobs like traveling secretaries and
sports information directors," said Carter, who has master's degrees in
psychology and physical education. "There really are more jobs in sports other
than coaching, which is the only things people think exists in sports after
their playing days are over.";   Her class consists of men's and women's
basketball players, softball players, soccer players and swimmers and even a
tennis player.;   "There are a lot of realities that athletes don't think
apply to them," Carter said. "The star high school athlete isn't always going
to be the star collegiate athlete. It happened to me my senior year of college
when I overtrained. I went from No. 1 singles player to No. 3 by the time the
season ended.;   "In sports, things seem very rosy and suddenly they change.
Hopefully this class will help those transitions become easier to handle."  </TEXT>
