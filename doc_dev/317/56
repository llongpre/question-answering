   A top higher education official called
Thursday for an end to athletic scholarships and shorter football,
basketball and baseball seasons as reforms needed to correct
``fundamental, systemic problems'' in intercollegiate sports.
   Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on
Education, the umbrella organization for the nation's colleges and
universities, told Congress that the scandals afflicting big-time
sports programs are not so much isolated cases as they are symptoms
of a ``basically unhealthy'' enterprise.
   In testimony to a House Education and Labor subcommittee, Atwell
also proposed the elimination of freshman eligibility in football
and basketball, and the equal sharing among all schools of the
television revenues now monopolized by the powerhouses.
   ``First and foremost,'' said Atwell, ``we must try to break the
insidious connection between money and winning'' in big-time
college sports.
   Atwell was among several academic, media and sports federation
officials who testified before the and Labor subcommittee on
problems afflicting collegiate sports programs.
   Frank Deford, former senior editor for Sports Illustrated,
declared that ``big-time college athletics has always been a
scandal and always will be, unless major changes are made. It is a
professional game which poses as amateur; a big business which uses
free labor.''
   Deford rejected arguments that revenues generated by glamour
sports benefits higher education as a whole. ``Rarely,'' he said,
``does any money raised for big-time athletics leave the athletic
department to enhance the university community.''
   Atwell, who said his proposals were his own and not those of the
council's member institutions, said ``there is a major set of
systemic problems that must be addressed if we in higher education
are serious about restoring public confidence in intercollegiate
athletics. ...''
   ``Some elements of the problem include an over-emphasis on
winning at the expense of other values; an over-concern with
spectator sports and spectator facilities as opposed to better
facilities for, and more emphasis on, participation in lifelong
fitness activities,'' he said.
   Atwell faulted the news media for bestowing lavish attention
upon big-time college sports ``while giving short shrift to
virtually everything else.''
   He lauded the National Collegiate Athletic Association for
recent enforcement actions and stiffened eligibility requirements.
``But the fact remains that too many programs and too many coaches
still care more about eligibility than education,'' he said.
   Dick Schultz, executive director of the NCAA, said ``I'm not
here to tell you there are not problems,'' ranging from drug abuse
to academic and monetary cheating. ``But the NCAA has not been
sitting idly by,'' he added.
   Jeff Farris, executive director of the National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics, noted that all member institutions in
the NAIA are required to conduct drug education programs and are
barred from accepting gifts from makers of alcohol and tobacco
products.
   Atwell said all college basketball games should be played after
Christmas and before March 15, and declared that any more than 85
baseball games ``is simply incompatible with the student-athlete
ideal.'' He did not specify how much he would shorten the football
season, but said ``the notion of a postseason college football
playoff, now being explored by the College Football Association, is
a perfectly awful idea.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., testified before the panel in behalf
of his legislation to require college recruiters to disclose to
high-school prospects, and the public at large, their record for
graduating student athletes, broken down by sport, race and sex.
   Bradley cited a recent USA Today survey which found that
Division 1 basketball players, for example, graduate at a rate of
only 17 percent. ``The challenge of a college experience,'' said
Bradley, a former All-America and NBA pro, ``should not be `making
the team,' but preparing to be a good citizen, friend and family
member.''
