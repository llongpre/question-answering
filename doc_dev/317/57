Soft Pedaling Ecology 
</P>
<P>
These days when people talk about conservation and ecology, they usually say 
something such as, "I'm saving water and recycling, but I'm not riding my bike 
to work or anything." 
</P>
<P>
The disclaimer is meant to show that although these people are in favor of 
doing what's expected, they aren't raving-green nut cases or anything. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Krikorian rides his bike to work -- from Silver Lake to Pierce 
College in Woodland Hills, where he is an English instructor -- but he's not a 
raving-green nut case either. He says it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend gave me my first racing bike about four years ago when I was really 
down and out, and I found that riding it made me feel better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine months, Krikorian, 32, has been following a schedule in which 
he drives his car the 25 miles to school on Monday, with the bike on a rack. 
Monday night, he leaves his car at school and pedals home, and Tuesday morning 
he rides back. Tuesday night he drives home and Wednesday drives back. That 
night and the next morning he bikes, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a Benotto bike that has Italian styling, is made in Mexico, with 
Japanese parts and French wheels, and I really feel good riding it," he said. 
"I'm like one of those anorexic runners that has to go farther and farther to 
get the same high." He would really like to pedal both ways every day, but he 
holds it down to every other day because he says clothing is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I get out of my riding clothes and shower in the faculty center when I get to 
school, but I'm always wearing the same thing I wore the day before because I 
forget to bring a change of clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Krikorian says the route from Woodland Hills over Oxnard Street to the 
Sepulveda Dam area over Burbank Boulevard to Lankershim Boulevard, down to 
Riverside Drive, over to Forest Lawn Drive and through Griffith Park is scenic, 
but not necessarily carefree. 
</P>
<P>
Because Daylight Saving Time ended, "I have to leave school earlier to get home 
before dark," he said. "It usually take me about 90 minutes to make the trip -- 
which is faster than some people do it by car in rush hour. But darkness is too 
much of a hazard to risk." 
</P>
<P>
He also doesn't ride in the rain. "It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hazard in pedaling to work has nothing to do with nature, however: 
It's lunatic motorists, Krikorian said. 
</P>
<P>
"There just seem to be some car drivers out there who want to give bike riders 
a scare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sky Watch 
</P>
<P>
There are people who are plane junkies, who just like to watch anything that 
goes up, up and away. 
</P>
<P>
You can find these people around any small airport, Van Nuys Airport being no 
different, except that it is among the busiest in the nation for small-plane 
traffic and has a lot of old flying military hardware that takes off 
occasionally, so the watching is about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 20 years, plane junkies have been hanging out at the 94th Aero 
Squadron restaurant at 16302 Raymer St. in Van Nuys, but the real hard core 
don't dilute their sky watch with dinner or drinks. They take it straight, at 
the minute Airport Observation Area, which is open to the public but almost 
impossible to find. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the observation area take a left off of Woodley Avenue onto Waterman 
Drive and go to the end, where there is a tiny parking lot next to the field. 
There, you can sit in your car and just watch. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the place is a challenge because the sign announcing it is small if 
you're going north on Woodley, and unreadable if you're going south. And, if 
you do see the sign, there is another sign that says Waterman Drive is a 
private road, which it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Kyoto native Hidenhiko Saki, who left Japan six months ago to live in the 
United States, is working at a nearby hotel. He spends Sundays watching the 
planes take off and touch down, and he brings along a radio so he can listen in 
on what the tower is saying to the pilots. He says it helps him to learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe High students Sean Dolezal, 16, and his brother, Michael, 14, live with 
their mom in Van Nuys. But when their dad comes for a visit from his home in 
Colorado, they take him to watch the planes. 
</P>
<P>
It's something of a busman's holiday for Steve Dolezal. He's a corporate pilot 
for McClosky Enterprises flying out of Aspen. "But you really see a lot of 
interesting aircraft here," the father said. "We saw a Gulfstream II take off a 
while back. It's a 12- to 14-seat corporate jet that probably costs about $7 
million."

Generation Gap Rap 
</P>
<P>
Judy Kass is a professional do-gooder who has spent most of her career working 
with hard cases. 
</P>
<P>
She has worked with mentally ill criminals, with battered women and children, 
with the mentally ill homeless. Now Kass, who has a master's degree in marriage 
and family counseling from UCLA, is working with two groups she thought should 
get to know one another, teen-agers and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Every Tuesday between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., the elders from the Pacoima 
Senior Citizen Multi-Purpose Senior Center and young people who attend the 
Pacoima Skills Center, a continuation high school, meet at the senior center 
for something called a Generational Gap Rap. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my thought that getting the two groups together might possibly be good 
for a number of reasons, which it has," Kass said. "The teen-agers, many of 
whom have never had a caring adult listen to them, are very willing to open up 
about their problems to the seniors. The children, many of whom have children 
of their own, respond to the kindness and mature thinking of adults who have no 
ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
What is particularly poignant, the counselor said, is hearing the youngsters 
talk about how pressured they feel to join gangs, and their elders pointing out 
that there are always choices. 
</P>
<P>
And the elderly get their opinions heard, as well. "The older participants have 
tried to explain to the young people how hard they have worked for what they 
have and how frightened they are by vandalism and other crimes against people 
and property," Kass said. "I think seeing it from the older person's 
perspective has been a real eye-opener for the youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Kass said, the elders were a bit slow to respond, but now the 
sessions have limited to 15 youngsters and 15 seniors.

unicycles." -- North Hollywood commuter
