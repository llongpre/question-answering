   Some see them as invaders, others consider
them economic saviors. But nearly everyone agrees this tiny
Appalachian town won't be the same with the arrival of 183 college
freshmen from Japan.
   ``I think there was some negative thinking and fear,'' said
Mayor Donna Stewart. ``But I think a lot of that went away after we
learned something about Japanese culture and met some other
students from Japan.
   ``The biggest thing, I think, is going to be patience. On both
sides.''
   Sixty students, fresh from Japanese high schools, arrived
Saturday at Salem-Teikyo University, created in July in a merger of
Salem College and Japan's Teikyo University. The rest of the
Japanese are due later this week.
   The students, who looked tired and bewildered after their
2{-hour ride from Pittsburgh aboard a chartered bus, said they were
surprised by their new surroundings.
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' said Yoshikawa Wataru, 19, of Tokyo.
``The spaces are so wide-open here and it's cold.'' Temperatures in
West Virginia were in the 30s and 40s Saturday.
   Akemi Matsumoto, 18, of Tokyo said she was a bit disappointed
that there were no shops or department stores in this town of 2,700
about 140 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.
   ``I was very surprised that there weren't any shops,'' she said.
``I didn't know it would be so wide open, but it's very nice.''
   This is Matsumoto's second trip to the United States. She was in
this country for a month two years ago.
   ``I'm here to study American business. My first purpose is to
learn to speak better English, and I want to make many friends in
America,'' Matsumoto said.
   Classes in a new year-round schedule begin April 23.
   ``I think our students will be very happy at Salem,'' said Jungi
Ikawa, the students' campus adviser. ``It's close to New York and
Washington, D.C., but set in a back-to-the-land atmosphere.
   ``In Japan, the colleges are crowded and noisy,'' said Ikawa.
``This is the opposite. It is very quiet here and the hills are
beautiful. The students can see nature and even animals right on
campus.''
   Teikyo, with 26,000 students in Japan and branches in Britain
and the Netherlands, last month announced a similar merger with
Westmar College in Le Mars, Iowa. Classes at Teikyo Westmar
University begin this fall.
   The university also operates a Pacific studies program with
Regis College near Denver. Other Japanese plans include a two-year
college in Maryland and a $250 million school near Washington,
D.C., for U.S and Japanese students.
   Many educators welcome the growing Japanese investment in U.S.
higher education. Such mergers give Japanese institutions
international prestige and provide the U.S. colleges, in some
cases, get much-needed capital.
   Before the merger, Salem College was struggling with 400
students and no endowment on a campus designed for 1,200. Teikyo
paid off the college's debts and boosted salaries an average 27
percent with a $12 million investment.
   Teikyo, which set up a $7.5 million endowment and will award
$400,000 in annual scholarships to Appalachian students, owns the
101-year-old school's grounds and plant, leasing it back to the
school.
   The school expects to spend $40 million to $60 million on
improvements, equipment and staff. An enrollment of 500 American
students and 500 Japanese students is planned by 1995.
   Americans will be required to attend two semesters each school
year and Japanese three, at a cost of about $5,000 a semester.
Asian studies will be stressed for Americans, and intensive English
courses for the Japanese.
   ``The people who attend Salem-Teikyo will be among the leaders
in business and politics someday in their respective countries,''
said Salem-Teikyo President Ronald E. Ohl. ``They will understand
each other and operate from a global viewpoint instead of the
narrow self-interest we see so much of today.''
   Most changes on campus have been cosmetic, but real changes will
be evident when Japanese and American live and learn side-by-side,
said senior Thad Davis, president of the student administration at
Salem-Teikyo.
   ``Some students are worried that things are going to get tougher
academically,'' said Davis, 24. ``Right now, a lot feel the
American students aren't being treated equally. They're using the
money to fix up dorms and the grounds for the Japanese. Those
things should have been done in prior years.''
   Ohl said some students may be unable to adapt to the changes.
``Ultimately, a couple years down the road, the only people who
will be here are those who want this kind of program,'' Ohl said.
