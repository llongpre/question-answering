<CAPTION>  Photos (2); PHOTO: Mercury News File Photographs; QUEST FOR THRILLS -- To
satisfy the public's demand for an escalation of thrills, amusement parks
continually build newer, more scary rides, such as PHOTO: Great America's
Vortex -- above during construction and at top during its March debut.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  PEOPLE just love good thrills, and amusement parks, along with their host
communities, love reaping the benefits: money, jobs and tourism.;   Rides of
all descriptions -- in and out of the water -- increasingly attract visitors,
even as the number of amusement parks shrinks nationwide. Experts estimate
that there are 250 to 300 parks in this country, compared with 450 to 500 20
years ago.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RIDING HIGH ON THRILL PARK REVENUE
COMMUNITIES' FORTUNES SOAR WITH THE INDUSTRY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Charles Jacques Jr., editor of Amusement Park Journal, a Natrona Heights,
Pa., publication focusing on the industry, likens the shrinkage to that of the
grocery business.;   "There used to be a lot of 'mom and pop' stores," he
said. "Then they became supermarkets. The little ones can't survive.";   But
those that do, the "supermarkets" of theme parks, seem to be doing quite
well.;   Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta, is home to Six Flags Over Georgia,
and to White Water, which is billed as "the most visited water park in the
Southeast.";   Like other amusement parks and theme parks, those in Cobb
thrive amid a quest for leisure that seems insatiable. The parks have become
more specialized, and their rides more scary -- "thrilling," as Terrie Ward,
public relations manager at Six Flags, puts it.;   The public demands an
escalation of thrills, said Tim Mescon, dean of the school of business at
Kennesaw (Ga.) State College. "The recreational community has become jaded,"
he said. "Every summer, we want to know what's next. Can you top this? How do
we create a value-added experience?";   SIX FLAGS opened in 1967, drawing 1.2
million visitors. Last year, visitors totaled 2.5 million. Similarly, White
Water visitors increased from 350,000 in its opening year, 1984, to 800,000
last year.;   Park officials do not discuss profits, but as any amusement
park-goer knows, a family of four can leave most large facilities with very
little change from a $100 bill.;   Attendance numbers add to the already
congested roads in Cobb County, but they are simply music to Cobb County
officials' ears.;   Mescon said communities hosting amusement parks benefit
from an "incubator" effect, as the facilities help attract conventions,
meetings and sporting events.;   Entertainment, of course, is what draws
visitors. And, during hard times, some experts believe, more families are
drawn together because the parks, expensive as they can be, still are more
affordable than vacations.;   "You get seven days of fun in three days,"
Jacques said.;   At White Water, where people climb aboard rides with names
like Bermuda Triangle and Dragon's Tail, Sonny Horton, the general manager,
said the goal is "to have more excitement without making mom and dad afraid to
get on the ride.";   Sarah Moreland, 10, went to Six Flags the other day with
Elizabeth Brigden, a friend who is a college student. Among Sarah's favorite
roller coaster rides are the Mind Bender and the Georgia Cyclone.;   "Riding
them scares you, but it's really fun after you do it," Sarah said.;   With
such endorsements, it is no wonder other communities are studying ways to cash
in on the amusement park bonanza.;   In Clayton County, another Atlanta
suburb, investors want to create a theme park based on Margaret Mitchell's
novel-turned-movie "Gone With the Wind," which drew on Clayton experiences and
personalities.;   If the park is built, it probably will have some genteel
rides, but none so daring as the high-flying Mind Bender, said Emory Brock,
the county's director of economic development, explaining, "I don't think a
roller coaster ride would go along with the (Civil War-era) South."  </TEXT>
