<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA COLLEGE officials are getting better at predicting the future, and
what we are seeing is scaring the living ivy out of us. We don't know how we
are going to handle the impact of California's continuing population boom (up
12 million from 1960 to 1990; 6 million more are due by 2005). Where will we
put the 790,000 more college students we can expect to be enrolled just 14
years from now?;   That's a bunch of people, roughly the population of San
Jose. To get them into classrooms and laboratories somewhere, the California
Post-secondary Education Commission estimates we will need to build 37 new
community colleges, expand existing California State University campus
capacity by 21 percent, establish five new CSU campuses or off-campus centers,
and construct three new University of California institutions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Forty-five new campuses in 14 years! The cost? The California Economic
Development Corporation estimates $10 billion in capital investment alone. No
one wants to think about the bills for microscopes, chalk and utilities, and
the number of new professors (thousands of them at $50,000 a pop) and support
staff we will need.;   Meanwhile, back on campuses, roofs leak, obsolete
equipment gathers dust, library hours shrink, and students stand in crowded
classrooms as a result of the worst budget crunch in the history of California
higher education. We must play much catch-up before we can build for the horde
of newcomers.;   And the horde is coming. Most are already in our communities
disguised as little kids; you can see the plywood pavilions going up at grade
schools everywhere. These youngsters will surge through the high schools and
drive the enormous expansion of the community college system, slated to
accommodate three quarters of the coming bulge. The other quarter will impinge
heavily on the senior institutions and less directly force expansion in their
expensive graduate programs. The CSU system must turn out the schoolteachers
and UC the college professors for this new academic boom. UC alone projects a
65 percent expansion in graduate enrollment, from 28,100 to 46,300, by 2005.; 
 So where is a state mired in recession, its defense-related industrial base
staggered by world peace, going to find the billions to finance this
expansion? Here are some ideas about the capital side of the problem that
would be worth exploring:;   (box) Use public funds to support enrollment to
capacity in the state's 172 private colleges. This might accommodate about
15,000 students, 2 percent of the coming bulge, without capital cost.;   (box)
At a vacancy rate of 20 percent, commercial real estate gluts the market. From
the I-680 corridor in the north to the Los Angeles basin (where rents have
fallen 15 percent), new office buildings stand unoccupied, visited only by the
occasional banker wringing his hands. In every hamlet in California, empty
strip shopping spaces, supermarkets and discount emporiums offer mute
testimony to the concentration of retailing into ever fewer hands. Such
property is readily convertible to academic use; much of it lies nicely
convenient to students and circuit-riding professors.;   (box) The peace
dividend will empty out 11 California military installations. Each site is
complete with roads, barracks, shops, power plants and all the expensive
infrastructure that new campuses will require. In Monterey County, 28,000-acre
Fort Ord alone could accommodate a major part of the projected growth in
student numbers.;   (box) And ready to tie these scattered installations to
expensive laboratories and libraries is the wizardry of modern
telecommunications. New technology now allows Baby Bells to distribute
information directly into homes and offices; the final regulatory barriers
fell in September. Some campuses, too, are already experienced in teaching
off-campus by electronic means. This semester, Chico State televises live,
interactive instruction to 750 students at locations in a dozen states, from
Oregon to Pennsylvania, and in 16 learning centers across the northern third
of California. The classrooms? Storefronts and office buildings and industrial
plants for such firms as IBM, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Alcoa, and
General Electric.;   President James A. Garfield's idea of a university was "a
student at one end of a log and Mark Hopkins at the other." Professor Hopkins
retired from Williams College in 1872 and logs grow scarce. But what if by
2005 the "log" is a satellite transmission with one end in the office of a
Berkeley Nobel laureate and the other in an abandoned Safeway in Whiskeytown
or a converted barracks at the Sacramento Army Depot? It's still a university.  </TEXT>
