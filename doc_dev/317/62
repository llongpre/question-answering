   A team from North Carolina State University won a
battle of wits Sunday with students from 15 other schools to win
the national College Bowl championship.
   The questions ranged from science and politics to entertainment
trivia, and contestants were quick to distinguish their sport from
the popular board game Trivial Pursuit.
   ``Trivial Pursuit is about trivia, but College Bowl is about
things you should have learned in college,'' said Mike Barkin, a
25-year-old law school graduate on the team of runnerup Emory
University.
   ``One might think of College Bowl players as eggheads, but
eggheads are the worst college bowl players,'' said Don Reid, who
created the television game show 35 years ago and attended this
weekend's contest.
   ``It (College Bowl) takes someone who is able to participate
quickly in anything in life _ someone who's alive to what's going
on in the world.''
   One question in the final between N.C. State and Emory was: ``On
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, he works from 9 to 5; on
Wednesdays, from 9 to 1; and on Fridays until early afternoon.
During working hours, he often takes two or three hours to read and
answer his fan mail.''
   Emory's Barkin pushed his buzzer and yelled, ``President
Reagan,'' before the moderator finished reading the question.
   That was correct, but it wasn't good enough to match the points
N.C. State team tallied during the two-day event at the Chicago
campus of the University of Illinois.
   Dan Petrus, a 24-year-old veterinary student at N.C. State who
trains four hours a week with his College Bowl team, said he's good
at the game because ``I remember a lot of facts and I'm able to
recall them quickly.''
   No prizes were awarded, but Petrus said the reward of beating
four-person teams from colleges such as Princeton University,
University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Cornell University ``is knowing that you've been able to think
faster and out-think the others _ it's an ego thing.''
   Only six of the 100 contestants were women. One of them, Peggi
Malys, a medical student at Emory, said she likes the game because
it develops, ``mental agility and cultural literacy.''
