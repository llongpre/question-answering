Ruling in a San Diego case sparked by a racially charged play, the U.S. Supreme 
Court on Monday let stand a decision that college officials do not have the 
authority to censor plays to be performed on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving intact a California court ruling, the Supreme Court refused to hear an 
appeal by San Diego Community College District officials who contended that 
they, not instructors or students, have final control over plays, publications 
and other "expressive activities" on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The court's refusal to hear the case suggests that college administrators do 
not have the same broad powers the justices granted high school officials -- in 
a case decided two years ago -- to limit freedom of speech in school-sponsored 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action Monday also signaled a victory not only for the college 
instructor and student who brought the suit, but for anyone with an interest in 
freedom of speech, said an ACLU lawyer who helped bring the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the principle involved -- that First Amendment issues were at the 
heart of what happened -- has been established and, more importantly, that a 
very resounding defense of the First Amendment for college students, and 
academic freedom for college instructors, has been affirmed," ACLU attorney 
Betty Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1986 when Alan DiBona, then a San Diego community college 
instructor, chose the play "Split Second" for his drama students to perform. 
The plot revolves around the shooting of a white suspect by a black policeman 
in New York City and the racial tensions that result. 
</P>
<P>
DiBona, who now lives in Seattle, planned to have the play performed at the 
Educational Cultural Complex in Southeast San Diego, a branch of the community 
colleges. Students auditioning for the play were to receive course credit. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, racial tensions in San Diego were high over the case of Sagon 
Penn, a young black man who was twice acquitted in the shooting of two white 
San Diego police officers and a Latino woman who was riding in the officers' 
squad car. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing of the play, several local ministers complained to Robert 
Matthews, who was then president of the Education Cultural Complex. Matthews 
now heads another college branch, the Continuing Education Centers. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the play, Matthews concluded that its language was 
"inappropriate" and its plot "not very uplifting." Then, saying the class 
lacked adequate enrollment, he ordered DiBona to cancel the production. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think the First Amendment should have been an issue there," 
Matthews said Monday. "The issue as I'm looking at it was simply the procedures 
of the school. We had the right to close the class if we didn't have the 
numbers necessary to keep class in operation. There was never any class, as far 
as we're concerned." 
</P>
<P>
DiBona and one of his students, Scott Gundlach, filed the lawsuit against 
Matthews and James Hardison, then the dean of arts and sciences, contending 
that they had violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. 
Hardison is now dean of another college branch, the Midway Center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, San Diego Superior Court Judge Arthur Jones ruled for the college 
administrators, saying DiBona and Gundlach did not have legal standing to bring 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
But last May, the 4th District Court of Appeal, on a 2-1 vote, reversed that 
decision and revived the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said it was aware of "no authority which would allow a 
college or university to censor" class materials selected by the instructor 
"because they contain 'indecent' language or deal with 'offensive' topics." 
</P>
<P>
Community college students, many of whom are adults, have full First Amendments 
rights, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The college appealed, relying on the 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that 
granted a high school principal, not the student editors, final control over 
what appears in the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment rights of high school students are not the same as those of 
adults, the U.S. Supreme Court said in that decision, adding that school 
officials legally control the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego Community College District said the logic of that 
decision should apply also to colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the college's appeal, 
and, on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, the ACLU attorney, said the Supreme Court action could bring about the 
end of the case because DiBona and Gundlach "have, to a large extent, achieved 
what they set out to achieve," which was an affirmation of their constitutional 
rights. Neither the instructor nor the student sought monetary damages, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 4th District Court's opinion, which still stands, the college retains 
the right to go to trial on the case. But Matthews said he had no burning 
desire for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing I want to happen," he said. The case "can continue on if 
others so desire, or it can stop where it is if others so desire. I don't care 
at this particular point." 
</P>
<P>
Donal M. Hill, the deputy county counsel who handled the case for the college, 
could not be reached Monday for comment. Neither could DiBona nor Gundlach.
