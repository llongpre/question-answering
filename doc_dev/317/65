<LEADPARA>  At sunset on the High Plains, a roar from the crowd swept the rodeo
grandstands. Behind the chutes, near the pens of snorting bulls and stomping
broncs, the cowboys pulled on their chaps.;   After a night's sleep in the
back of his pickup truck, Scoobe Halterman, a lanky cowboy who had driven 400
miles to Evanston, was ready to climb aboard an ornery 2,000-pound bull. In
his career of almost 10 years, this 27-year-old professional bull rider has
broken both legs, a shoulder, two fingers and some teeth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The main thing," he said, as he stared toward a pen holding the massive,
horned Brahma that he soon would mount, "is to stay alive.";   Prize total of
$2.6 million; Rodeo, among the nation's oldest native sports, and the most
dangerous, is soaring to new levels of popularity and prize money. In the past
four years, the number of professional rodeos has jumped by 25 percent, to
about 800. A prize total of $2.6 million will be awarded at the National Rodeo
Finals in December, compared with about $150,000 at the 1970 finals.;   For
the first time, a schedule of rodeos has been carried this year on cable
sports television, along with baseball, football and basketball. An increasing
number of professional rodeo cowboys, perhaps one-third of them, now earn a
living solely from the competitions, although it's a pittance compared to that
of other professional athletes.;   College-trained cowboys; And far fewer of
the cowboys come from ranches anymore. Halterman, for example, the son of a
policeman, grew up in Las Vegas. Prospective rodeo cowboys can learn their
skills at clubs and at colleges and universities in the West. Many schools
recruit young cowboys and award them scholarships, just like other colleges do
prized football players.;   The surging interest in rodeo, especially among
people from urban areas, seems to have been driven, at least in part, by a
romantic yearning for Old West culture, even as the number of workaday ranch
cowboys has been declining.;   "There is a certain harkening back to the
America that once was," said T.A. Larson, a retired professor of the American
West at the University of Wyoming. "There aren't many working cowboys left.
But the rodeos symbolize that culture. The real working cowboys, of course,
don't do much of what you see at rodeos. There is very little roping, for
example. They spend most of their time cutting and stacking wheat, mending
fences. But then, you couldn't draw a paying crowd for that."  </TEXT>
