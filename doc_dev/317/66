   Vice President George Bush says the memories
are still fresh from four decades ago when he played first base for
Yale University in baseball's College World Series.
   Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee, played for the Yale
team that finished second in the series in 1947 and 1948, losing to
California the first year and to Southern California the next.
   He reminisced about the experience _ and recalled a fatally
flawed bit of strategy _ in a recent letter to the Omaha
World-Herald which had asked about his College World Series days.
   The 1988 series begins Friday, its 39th consecutive year here.
The 1947 and 1948 series were in Kalamazoo, Mich.
   The 1948 tournament was ``the highlight of my college baseball
experience,'' Bush wrote.
   ``We had great college pitching,'' he said. ``Frank Quinn was a
real star. He signed right after the '48 season with the Red Sox
for a big bonus. Dick Manville, another pitcher, was major-league
material, too.''
   ``Competition really is great,'' Bush told the newspaper.
``Being part of a winning team is a thrill. Teamwork is very
important. Fitness, of course, matters.
   ``I still clear the head by running two miles, and riding an
exercycle on bad days. I have always loved sports.''
   Bush also recalled some Yale strategy that backfired in 1947.
   ``We walked the eighth hitter to get to the ninth hitter,'' Bush
told the World-Herald. ``That turned out to be their pitcher.
Jackie Jensen, later of Red Sox fame, strode to the plate and hit
one that's still rolling out there.''
