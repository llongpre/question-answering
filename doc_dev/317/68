Tony Cohen thinks he might pursue an advertising career once his tennis career 
at Cal Lutheran ends. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, along with completing the class work required of a marketing 
major, Cohen employs subliminal techniques of the soft sell in his tennis game. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have trouble playing me because of my style," Cohen says. "I 
don't hit the ball as hard as most players at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets into an opponent's head. Once he thinks, 'I can't believe this guy is 
beating me,' that's when I know I'm going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Cohen has been a pretty good advertisement for the Cal Lutheran tennis 
program, which is enjoying another successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, at Christ College in Irvine, Cal Lutheran won its third consecutive 
NAIA District 3 tournament team championship. Cohen defeated teammate Matt 
Simpson to win the singles championship and also teamed with Simpson to win the 
doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cohen and the Kingsmen will begin play in the NAIA championships at 
Rockhill Country Club in Kansas City, Mo., where they will try to improve on 
last season's 17th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, which finished the regular season 14-13, is ranked 20th among the 
35 teams that are expected to take part. Defending-national champion Lander 
College of Greenwood, S.C., Texas College of Tyler and the University of West 
Florida are among the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"All year we've been beleaguered by injury after injury after injury," said 
John Siemens, who is in his ninth year as coach of the Kingsmen. "How we do 
back there depends on our draw and how well bodies hold up." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, in fact, is the only Cal Lutheran player who is not nursing an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Paavo Salmi, the team's No. 1 player for most of the season, has two bad 
ankles, Simpson has been bothered by elbow and thigh problems, Mike Gennette 
has a strained Achilles' tendon, Brian Turner's wrist, ankles and shoulder are 
tender and George Kovacs has a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's hopes, therefore, would appear to be riding on Cohen, who was 
26-8 during the regular season and is the only ranked player (64th) on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony doesn't give away points. He's a counterpuncher more than anything else," 
Siemens said. "He cuts you and slices you and you bleed to death, and you don't 
even know you're bleeding because he does it so softly." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 21, lost only five matches in three years at El Camino Real High before 
enrolling at Cal State Northridge upon graduation in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But he never got the chance to compete at Northridge. He redshirted his 
freshman year, after which the school announced that it was dropping its men's 
tennis program. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple friends said they were thinking of transferring to a school called 
Cal Lutheran," recalled Cohen, who grew up in Woodland Hills. "I had never even 
heard of Cal Lutheran." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen transferred to Pierce College for the 1988 spring semester and went 
undefeated in the regular season before losing in the Western State Conference 
tournament quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
He transferred to Cal Lutheran in February, and, despite missing the first 
three weeks of the tennis season because of a transcript delay, has become the 
team's top contender for individual national honors. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Groff had the best finish ever by a Cal Lutheran men's tennis player when 
he reached the quarterfinals of the national championships in 1987.
