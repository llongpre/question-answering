When Ventura College women's basketball Coach George Valenzuela blows the first 
whistle at practice each weekday morning, most of his players quickly wipe the 
sleep out of their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Valenzuela usually cracks a few yawns himself as he gets his vocal 
cords in yelling-drill form. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to start practice at 6 a.m., but playing junior college women's 
basketball requires sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
At least Ventura gets to practice in its own gymnasium. At Oxnard College, the 
women's team is forced to practice and play all of its home games at Santa 
Clara High because the college has no indoor basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard women, however, have the luxury of practicing at 7 p.m. "But that's 
only when there's no conflict with any of the high school teams," Coach Dan 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing inconveniences, players and coaches of both teams insist 
they wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"The one factor we all have in common is that we've been part of a winning 
program in the past and want to continue that," said Valenzuela, a former 
girls' basketball coach at Rio Mesa High who still teaches there. "A lot of the 
girls hope this will be a steppingstone to a four-year program." 
</P>
<P>
The road to a university is a difficult jaunt, especially for the players at 
Ventura and Oxnard. Athletes must shuffle odd practice schedules with classes 
and part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Games are held as far as Bakersfield and San Diego, which adds to the time 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
There are no scholarships, and every member of both teams holds down a job to 
help cover expenses. To maintain eligibility, athletes must take at least 12 
hours a semester and maintain a 'C' average. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura players start their days with practice, attend classes in the morning 
and work in the afternoon. Evenings are reserved for studying. With games on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays, free time is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference for Oxnard's players is that practice is at night. They 
must use the early morning hours for extra study time. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches' schedules are typical of the hardships experienced on the junior 
college level. Valenzuela, a single parent, has beaten a path between Ventura 
and Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Campbell starts his days at 7 a.m. at his job with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. He usually gets home at 10 or 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to put more effort into fitting everyone into practice," said 
Campbell, a former girls' coach at Camarillo High. "There are a lot of 
schedules to coordinate. I also have to coordinate with Santa Clara's teams, so 
there is a lot to juggle. If there is a conflict, we're always low on the totem 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
"But getting motivated is never a problem. The thrill of playing basketball on 
a higher level is what inspires all of us. Intrinsically, the people on our 
team are competitive. If we weren't going out for basketball, it would be 
another sport. We have to be competing. 
</P>
<P>
"But certainly with the sacrifices that must be made, it takes a special type 
of person." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is competing, with the slim hope of landing a scholarship to a 
major college. Neither Valenzuela or Campbell has sent a player beyond the 
junior college ranks since they took over their respective programs three years 
ago. But that may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is battling for the Western State Conference championship this season, 
thanks in part to the play of 6-foot-3 center Chris Royers. 
</P>
<P>
Royers, a sophomore, is averaging 16 points and 20 rebounds a game. She set a 
school record of 29 rebounds in a game earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Her play and size have attracted interest from the University of Oklahoma, Long 
Beach State and the University of San Francisco, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The attention is amazing, considering Royers played sparingly while she 
attended Buena High. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in high school said that I was just a big girl who was 
uncoordinated," Royers said. "But I've matured and gotten a lot stronger at 
Ventura. I have a lot more confidence now. I'm no longer a bench warmer." 
</P>
<P>
Royers recently wrecked her car, so she must walk or ride her bicycle to 
practice two miles each morning. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she loves being on the court just after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Ytteb Bowls lives in Oxnard, so she must allow extra traveling time to 
make the early morning workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I love waking up that early," said Bowls, a 5-9 freshman forward from Channel 
Islands High. "It gets you energized for the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Bowls had scholarship offers to the University of Delaware and Southwest Texas, 
but decided to attend a junior college and see if she could attract an offer 
closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
She should attract plenty of offers if she plays like she did in last week's 
82-69 upset win over Moorpark, when she scored a season-high 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard sophomore Tami Cleaver will probably end her basketball career at the 
end of the season, but she said the two extra years have been well worth the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
She feels this way despite the fact that the Condors are 0-5 in the conference 
and 5-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my own ambition to keep playing and to stay in shape," said Cleaver, 
who attended Oxnard High. "It's been a sacrifice, especially because I have 
really dedicated myself to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a sacrifice I've enjoyed. I didn't mind it a bit." 
</P>

teams.
