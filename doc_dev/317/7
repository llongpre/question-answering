To Be Affected Little by the Market

   The stock market's gyrations will have little or no effect on college tuition next fall, even at those colleges and universities most dependent on their capital endowments. 

   School administrators say the market's plunge may cause more students to apply for financial assistance, especially if the downward drift in stock prices persists. 
But this might also work to limit tuition increases. 
The schools are competing for students and are prepared to offer financial help. 

   "You don't want to price yourself outside of the market if the people who are paying the bills don't have money," says John Temple, executive vice president of Emory University in Atlanta. 

   Tuition at most schools will increase, but the increases, which were expected, have nothing to do with the stock market. 
Fees at private four-year institutions rose about 8% in each of the past two years to a current average of $7,110. 
Public institutions raised their fees 6% in each of the years to an average of $1,359. 
Similar increases, caused by rising costs, are expected next year. 

   Some heavily endowed schools took a major beating in last Monday's market. 
Some $200 million of Stanford University's $1.5 billion endowment disappeared then. 
Wabash College, an all-male school of about 850 students in Crawfordsville, Ind., had a loss of 30% of its $125 million endowment. 
Wabash gets more than 63% of its operating budget from endowment income, more than any other college in the country. 

   The market's subsequent rebound softened the blow. 
But even if it hadn't, financial officers say, additional tuition increases probably wouldn't have been necessary. 
For the most part, the bull market of the past five years has increased the institutions' endowments and their investment income. 
And the institutions have refrained from tapping all the growth to meet yearly operating expenses. 

   "We didn't ride the elevator up -- at least we didn't take the full ride -- so we're not going to be affected" on the way down, says a spokesman for Stanford, which has 60% of its endowment in securities. 

   Smith College's endowment had grown an average of 21% a year in each of the past five to $299.6 million. 
Smith had a loss of $45 million last Monday but regained half of the loss later and still remains richer than it was last year. 
"We're in better shape now than we've ever been before even with this bad year," says Charles Johnson, associate treasurer. 

   Some institutions succeeded in cushioning the blow. 
They moved money out of the market before it crashed, or they hedged. 
As much as 70% of Harvard University's endowment had been invested in equities in the first half of 1987. 
But when the crash came, Harvard had reduced the equity proportion to less than 50%, says Roderick M. MacDougall, treasurer. 

   Some colleges are prepared to dip into the endowment funds to increase scholarship assistance or avoid big tuition increases. 
One is Williams College, in Massachusetts, which already provides financial aid to 35% of its students. 
Williams's endowment, which stood at $240 million after last Monday's crash, provides about 21% of its $50 million yearly operating budget. 

   Many officials think the market will work its worst damage not on endowment income but on alumni contributions. 
"That gets down to consumer psychology and just what people have in their pockets," says Daniel Evans, treasurer of Wabash College. 
He says he expects Wabash will get the money it asks from contributors, but, he adds, "I'd expect it to be more difficult."
