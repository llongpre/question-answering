<LEADPARA>  The first woman to play college baseball has left her team, citing sexism
among her teammates, coach and athletic director. Her college says she was
merely reacting to isolated incidents.;    Julie Croteau, who has just
finished her junior year, says she has taken a leave of absence from St.
Mary's College, an NCAA Division III school, for at least a semester and might
transfer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Croteau, a reserve first baseman, also charged the college with widespread
discrimination against female athletes, including inferior coaching,
facilities and scheduling. The college denied these charges.;    Croteau was
the only woman ever to become a regular, full-time player on a college
baseball team in her freshman year.;    She told USA Today she "has spent more
time fighting and being emotionally destroyed by baseball than enjoying the
game. It's not fun anymore.";    For instance, she said teammates once read
aloud a degrading article from Penthouse during a team bus ride, spoke lewdly
while planning a party that would include pornographic videos, and spoke
obscenely of female genitalia.;    The coach, Hal Willard, told USA Today the
Penthouse reading was "an isolated incident," adding, "It was just guys being
guys." He said he had no knowledge of the party.;    College spokeswoman
Christine Cihlar said Willard told the team that reading from Penthouse was
inappropriate.  </TEXT>
