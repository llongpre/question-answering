<LEADPARA>  WHEN I was driving to work during rush hour, I saw a car that had slid off the
road. I didn't stop to help.;    The Kitty Genovese case flashed into my mind.
This event has shaken our most basic beliefs about human compassion.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley, who have studied the problem of
the unresponsive bystander, tell the story:;    "Kitty Genovese is set upon by
a maniac as she returns home from work at 3 a.m. Thirty-eight of her neighbors
in New York come to their windows when she cries out in terror; none comes to
her assistance even though her stalker takes over half an hour to murder her.
And no one even so much as calls the police. She dies.";    Many times
bystanders do help in emergencies. But such shocking cases continue to occur.
Latane andDarley describe another instance, the case of Andrew Mormille.;   
"He is stabbed in the stomach as he rides the A train home in Manhattan.
Eleven other riders watch the 17-year-old boy as he bleeds to death; none
comes to his assistance even though his attackers have left the car. He
dies.";    In "The Unresponsive Bystander: Why Doesn't He Help?" Latane and
Darley report a series of experiments designed to shed light on this
question.;    They have come to a fascinating conclusion: We are especially
shocked when a lot of people witness an emergency and no one helps. Yet it is
actually the presence of a lot of people that seems to inhibit people from
helping.;    Think about it this way, Latane and Darley say: Suppose your car
breaks down on a busy highway. Hundreds of drivers will go by without stopping
to help. Nobody feels he has any responsibility.;    But if your car breaks
down on a deserted road, any person driving by will probably stop to help. The
driver feels responsible.;    To test this idea, Latane and Darley designed a
clever experiment that resembles the Kitty Genovese murder.;    College
students were asked to take part in a group discussion of personal problems
about college life. Each student was placed in a separate room and talked over
an intercom so as not to embarrass anyone.;    One student was actually the
experimenter's helper who played the part of a victim in an emergency.;   
After everyone in the group had talked, the student "victim" pretended to be
having a seizure. Over the intercom, he started choking, said he thought he
was going to die, and begged for help.;    When the group of college students
talking on the intercom consisted of only two people -- the "victim" and
another student -- 100 percent of the students responded by the end of the
seizure and most responded immediately, in less than a minute.;    They ran
outside and told the experimenter that the "victim" needed help.;    When the
group of college students consisted of six people -- the "victim" and five
others, only 31 percent of the students responded by the end of the seizure,
and they took their time about it. They took, on the average, more than three
minutes to respond.;    Through their studies, Latane and Darley found other
reasons why people were less likely to help in an emergency when they were in
a crowd.;    Partly, people were not exactly sure what was happening. Were
they watching a stranger attack a victim or a family fight?;    They tried to
find out if the emergency was real by watching how other people reacted. If
the other people didn't react, then they were less likely to react either.
Being in a crowd thus made them less likely to act.;    Also, being in a crowd
made them more worried about reacting stupidly and making a fool of themselves
in front of others.;    These shocking cases of unresponsive bystanders,
Latane and Darley believe, occur more often in big cities like New York
because a lot more people are around. These cases occur less often in small
towns.;    People who have grown up in small towns, the researchers found, are
more likely to help in emergencies.  </TEXT>
