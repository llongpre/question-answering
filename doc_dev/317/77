   Congress took a first step Monday to require
colleges to tell prospective students how many athletes graduate
and how much crime there is on campus as well as how many football
titles and Nobel Prize winners it has.
   By voice vote, the House approved a bill requiring colleges and
universities that receive federal financial aid and grant athletic
scholarships to provide graduation data to the Education
Department.
   Academic institutions receiving federal student aid also must
disclose to students and employees campus security policies and
crime statistics.
   The bill was produced by a conference committee of the House and
Senate that ironed out differences in versions passed by each
House. The Senate must approve before the bill can go to the
president.
   ``Choosing which college or university to attend is a difficult
decision for parents and students,'' said Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., chairman of the Education and Labor subcommittee on
post-secondary education.
   ``Surely they deserve as much information as possible.''
   Under the bill, academic institutions must provide an annual
report to the Education Department, starting in 1992, on how many
students receive athletic scholarships and the graduation rate by
race and sex for students on football and basketball scholarships.
   In addition, colleges and universities must provide the
graduation rate for all students as well as the rate for students
on other athletic scholarships, including baseball, track and all
other sports combined.
   When a student is offered an athletic scholarship, the college
must provide the information to the student, parents, coach and
guidance counselor.
   The provisions on crime awareness and campus security take
effect on Sept. 1, 1991 and require the college to provide
statistics on crimes that have occurred during the past three
school years, including murder, rape and robbery.
   The college also must report the number of arrests for liquor
law violations, drug abuse and weapons possession.
