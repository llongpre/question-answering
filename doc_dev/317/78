   Measles has hit some colleges this winter, but
federal health officials said outbreaks of the disease normally
associated with childhood are scattered and no cause for great alarm.
   Students lined up for measles vaccine last week at the C.W. Post
campus of New York's Long Island University, and free inoculations
were offered this week at the University of Texas.
   A measles outbreak caused Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., to
cancel its basketball season and Ohio's Kent State University
stopped sending nursing students to local hospitals for fear of
giving patients measles.
   ``We're definitely having measles outbreaks right now, but it is
unfortunately nothing new,'' said Dr. Diane Simpson of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control's immunization division. ``We do get
outbreaks on college campuses and high school campuses (each year).''
   Most states require children to be inoculated for measles before
entering school, but some still reach college without immunity.
   In some cases, Simpson said, the vaccine doesn't take; in others,
colleges may not have required proof of immunization.
   At C.W. Post, where 19 cases were reported as of Monday,
immunization rules are now being strictly enforced, said spokeswoman
Mary Ring.
   Measles cases at Siena College in New York and the University of
Hartford in Connecticut prompted the East Coast Athletic Conference
to ban spectators from the scheduled March 9-11 basketball
tournament.
   Measles can be transmitted easily at colleges because of close
living quarters, said Valerie Cox, assistant director for nursing
services at the University of Texas.
   Only three cases have been reported at the University of Texas,
but 154 cases were reported recently in Lubbock, many of them in
public schools and at Texas Tech University, where the outbreak
prompted immunization of 5,200 students.
   The CDC also reported measles at Bradley University in Illinois.
   Through last week, 244 measles cases had been reported nationwide
since Jan. 1, up from 204 at the same time last year, according to
CDC statistics.
   But Simpson said those figures may not reflect the recent college
outbreaks or other recent outbreaks among younger children.
   Measles, or rubeola, is usually marked by a rash, fever, cough,
congestion, and red, sensitive eyes. Complications can occur without
proper treatment.
   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the once
common childhood disease could be eradicated in the United States by
fall 1982, but in the last six years, 1,497 to 6,282 cases have been
reported annually.
