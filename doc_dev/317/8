<P>
Saying she regretted she had to play Scrooge, a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge stepped into the San Fernando Valley Christmas tree war Monday, ordering 
farmer Joe Cicero not to sell Christmas trees on land he leases from Pierce 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a courtroom clash with distinctive holiday touches, such 
as discussions of sleigh rides, reindeer and the telltale signs of an illicit 
Christmas tree lot -- the construction of tinsel-wrapped arches, candy-striped 
poles, and green and white flags. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was a harsh economic reality in the ruling by Judge Dzintra A. 
Janavs, granting the Los Angeles Community College District a temporary 
restraining order against Cicero. He's stuck with 8,000 Christmas trees -- at a 
cost of an estimated $120,000 -- and nowhere to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be just devastating and catastrophic to my client," said Harold 
Kippen, who represents the farmer, whose family has plowed Valley fields since 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
The victor was Miller &amp; Sons, one of the largest Christmas tree vendors in 
California. The company has 40 lots, including one across the street from 
Cicero's, which is on the campus in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
As owner Stu Miller and his lawyer tell it, the skirmish between the two men is 
a simple case of free enterprise -- too free. Cicero pays the college district 
about $15,000 to lease 25 acres of farmland at Pierce College, but was charged 
nothing extra last year to add Christmas trees to his usual produce stand sales 
of fruits, vegetables and Halloween pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting something for nothing," said attorney Michael B. Scott, who 
represents Miller. "My client is not out just to put Cicero out of business. . 
. . All he wants is the right to bid on the property." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who estimated his annual statewide sales at 400,000 trees -- 85,000 in 
the Valley alone -- said Cicero had caused him to lose at least 3,200 sales in 
December, 1989. Despite assurances from the college that no trees would be sold 
this year, he said his employees noticed tinseled arches and candy-striped 
poles going up at Cicero's stand in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who sold trees at the college in 1986 in cooperation with the 
Associated Students Organization, said he has inquired annually since then 
about the possibility of selling there again. Letters from college officials 
filed with the court show that they repeatedly responded that they would not 
allow tree sales on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the big-guy bully," Miller said. "Joe Cicero's doing no more than 
stealing our business." 
</P>
<P>
But Kippen said it is just that: a case of the Goliaths -- Miller and the 
college district -- trying to squash a Yuletide David. 
</P>
<P>
Kippen conceded that Christmas trees were not in the five-year lease that 
Cicero signed with the district in 1986; in fact, the lease only calls for the 
sale of products grown on the land. But he said that since then, verbal 
agreements were made between his client and college officials to allow sales of 
other items, including pumpkins and trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at all the kiddies who are going to be without their sleigh rides," 
Kippen said, referring to the rides Cicero offered on his lot last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Miller lots sometimes feature live reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Cicero, with the college's support, succeeded in defeating an 
identical request by Miller for a temporary restraining order. But in the 
months that followed, the college switched sides, joining Miller. A series of 
telephone calls and letters to Cicero followed, banning 1990 sales on college 
property. 
</P>
<P>
James Lynch, assistant general counsel for the college district, said the 
change of mind was largely the result of a lawsuit by Miller against the 
district. That suit, filed concurrently with the action taken against Cicero in 
late 1989, alleged that the district fostered unfair competition by failing to 
allow others to bid on the right to sell trees from the campus location, in 
violation of state laws covering profit-making activities on public land. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation as a public agency to do what we feel is right with the 
taxpayers' money," Lynch said. "It does us no good financially to continue 
fighting this lawsuit, which could be very lengthy." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said that a year ago, the district sided with Cicero because the then-new 
Pierce College president, Dan Means, had inadvertently granted him permission 
to sell trees. 
</P>
<P>
Under a settlement agreement with Miller signed earlier this year, the college 
agreed that no more trees would be sold on the land until Cicero's lease 
expires in December, 1991. That agreement comes before a judge for ratification 
Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
In her ruling Monday, Janavs rejected Miller's contentions of unfair 
competition: "What's unfair about someone selling Christmas trees competing 
with someone else?" she asked. But she agreed with the college district's 
assertion that Cicero's lease did not include Christmas tree sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I am bothered by the fact that Cicero seems to be quite deliberately trying to 
go outside the bounds of that agreement," Janavs said. 
</P>
<P>
Kippen said he would discuss with Cicero the possibility of appealing.
