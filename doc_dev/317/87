<LEADPARA>  Hiking up the steep, gravelly trails of Mission Peak is exercise enough for
most suburbanites.;   But a growing number of people are reaching the pinnacle
of the Fremont landmark in an even more arduous and difficult manner: by
bicycle.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The steepness of the route would seem, to the uninitiated, to make pedaling
impossible. Some hikers who have struggled to make it to the top seem startled
to be passed by someone "climbing" on a mountain bike.;   "It's not a
beginner's ride," said Noel Dizon, a 24-year-old student and employee of F&amp;M
Cyclery who rides the mountain about once a week. "It's all uphill. Mission
Peak defines if you're a serious rider, as opposed to Coyote Hills, which is
for the casual rider," he said.;   Dizon goes up the hill on his 21-speed
Nishiki mountain bike, in which he has invested about $1,500, replacing
standard parts with lighter -- and more expensive -- hardware. But it takes
more than good equipment and sheer muscle to make it up the hill. On the
steepest parts, one moves so slowly that just maintaining balance becomes
difficult.;   And merely shifting to a very low climbing gear doesn't make
things easy -- it just makes the rear wheel spin in the dirt. One technique to
overcome that problem involves leaning as far back as possible to put more
weight over the rear wheel, without leaning so far back that the front wheel
rises off the ground.;   Another technique is to pedal sitting down, which is
not easy when moving uphill.;   "You have to have strong legs," said West
Kurihara, a 32-year-old engineer at NASA Ames who laments that his scientific
expertise is of little use on Mission Peak.;   "There are guys who do it to
see if they can get to the top without walking, and there are a lot of guys
out there who are just trying to make it to the top at all," he said.;   "When
I first moved to Fremont in 1985, I used to ride up there after work, and
there were less than a dozen regular riders up there. Today there are lots of
them.";   There are two routes to the top of Mission Peak. One begins at
Ohlone College and climbs 2,500 feet in 3.5 miles. That's the easy way. The
other route begins above Weibel Winery, on Stanford Avenue directly below the
peak.;   Liz West often rides both of the routes on her way home from work.
West, 31, is the laboratory director for Weibel. She pedals away from work, up
the Weibel trail, down the Ohlone trail and then home.;   "For me it's a good
after-work ride," she said.;   Going down the peak may be more of a thrill
than going up, but it's also more dangerous. "There's a lot of gravel and ruts
on the downhill," Dizon said. "Even a lot of people who ride a lot end up
crashing on it."  </TEXT>
