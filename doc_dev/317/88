<LEADPARA>  WHEN CHARLIE Yzaguirre traded life in the corporate fast lane to work as a
volunteer at a children's counseling center, the only type of wheeling and
dealing he found was the lunch box kind -- where a couple of shark-shaped
fruit treats could bring an apple pie in trade.;    But it's a glorious change
for the business school graduate who has spent the last few months working as
a volunteer at the Children's Counseling Center in Santa Clara.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yzaguirre, 23, is one of more than 400 people who are participating in the
Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a program which places recent college graduates into
volunteer positions with social service agencies around the country for a
year.;    As part of his internship, Yzaguirre works 35 hours a week at the
Children's Counseling Center, a countywide non-profit mental health program
that provides day treatment for children ages 5 to 12 who have severe
emotional or behavioral disorders. The program attracts students from all over
Santa Clara County.;    Yzaguirre helps staff members at the center, which is
based at Pomeroy School in Santa Clara. He fills out behavior sheets on the 12
children at the center, monitors one of the three lunch tables and works as a
leader on various projects. In return, Yzaguirre is provided with room and
board and a $75 a month stipend.;    A native of the Bronx, Yzaguirre
graduated from Boston College in May 1990 with a degree in marketing. He had
planned on a career in the corporate world, working for an advertising agency,
when his best friend intervened.;    "He told me about the JVC volunteer
program and we both went to an information session they held on campus," he
said.;    Although he already had job offers, Yzaguirre was so impressed with
the program, he decided to take the year off to participate in it.;    "There
was always something in the back of my head that I wanted to work with
children and people," he said.;    The youngest of seven children, Yzaguirre
had volunteered in high school, and in college he worked on a peer suicide hot
line and as a resident assistant in the dormitory.;    Yzaguirre has received
high marks for his work with the children.;    "Charlie is just great. He's
really been a good role model for the kids," said Liz Heitel, director of the
center, who nominated Yzaguirre for the Junior League's Silver Bowl award,
which recognizes outstanding community volunteers. Yzaguirre, was one of 24
people who received the award in April.;    Yzaguirre, an easy-going sort, who
still maintains a bit of his New York accent, begins his days bright and early
-- 6 a.m. It's quite a change from his days as a student, when rolling out of
bed before noon was a rarity.;    A day with spent with Yzaguirre is
exhausting. One minute he's practicing his cursive writing on the big, green
chalkboard, the next he's playing super sleuth in an animated game of Clue and
the next he's comforting an upset child with soothing words and motions.;   
"Children are fun because they haven't learned yet how to hold back. They're
very honest. They don't lie well -- and they're a kick," he said.;    The
experience has definitely made an impression. In two years, Yzaguirre said he
plans on going back to graduate school to get a masters in marriage, family
and child counseling. Till then, he's not sure what he'll be doing.;    "One
of the things I like best is how open everyone is (at the center). That's one
of the reasons I'm not sure I want to go back to the business world," he
said.;    Part of Yzaguirre's duty is picking up students and delivering them
to the school. Today, he's on the road by 7:20 a.m. maneuvering a big, blue
van and heading for his first of six stops.;    The morning van ride is calm
and collected -- at least until the first few inquiring passengers are picked
up. Spying a new face in the van, they are immediately filled with questions.;
   "Who's that, Charlie?";    "Are we gonna be famous?";    Yzaguirre is
careful to maintain a firm hand with his rambunctious passengers. Every once
in a while he's forced to give time outs -- three-minute penalties which are
issued for bad behavior and taken off the child's recess time once they arrive
at school.;    But even Yzaguirre is not immune to a fit of silliness once in
a while. He laughs easily with the children and takes an active part in their
games.;    When the van pulls up behind a small Toyota compact, the boys are
filled with visions of the Road Warrior.;    "Hit 'em Charlie, hit 'em and
let's run," shouted one enthusiastic rider.;    "Squish him," says another.;  
 Yzaguirre plays along for bit but then says calmly, "If we hit them there
won't be any van left, then how will you get to school?";    The boys
contemplate the thought for a moment and grow quiet. Score one for the big guy.  </TEXT>
