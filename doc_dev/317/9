</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision is expected Friday on basketball standout J. R. Rider's appeal to 
regain his sophomore year of eligibility at Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Rider, a 6-foot-5 transfer from Allen County (Kan.) College, was declared 
ineligible for this season early this month when it was determined that he did 
not have the minimum 2.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Conference representatives voted 6 to 1 in Rider's favor and have 
forwarded Rider's appeal to the Southern California Appeals Board of the 
Commission on Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member appeals board will meet today at El Camino College and is 
scheduled to announce its decision Friday.
