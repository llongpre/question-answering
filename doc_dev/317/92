Remember when you got your first driver's license and swore you'd never pedal 
your bike another inch? Remember when even the 10-year-old family station wagon 
had more status than the most expensive Italian racing bicycle? 
</P>
<P>
But now when you're spending too much time behind the wheel, and you spot a 
lean cyclist on the road with the wind blowing in his face, the lowly bicycle 
-- that vehicle you once thought was the quintessential symbol of immaturity -- 
somehow has risen in stature. It now represents physical and mental fitness, 
self-discipline and, even freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For an ever-increasing number of Southern Californians, cycling means more than 
just another idle promise to lose a few pounds. More and more people are 
cycling to regain a portion of their youth and lose a portion -- the one 
hanging over their belt -- of their adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
And it seems that once they've made the commitment to give cycling a try, many 
are turning into fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, you don't find a 100-mile jaunt to San Diego for the day 
fanatical. And if you don't, that probably means you're among the growing 
number of serious "recreational" cyclists who curse their busy schedules 
because sometimes they can only get in a 100 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as four or five years ago, you could ride the Santiago Canyon Road 
(connecting El Toro and Orange) and you'd see two or three other groups of 
cyclists," said Ed Everett, a 24-year-old from Orange who recently opened a 
bicycle shop in Mission Viejo. "Now on Saturdays and Sundays, it's just one 
long, constant stream. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if these people are riding around the block a couple of times and 
calling it a workout, either. A number of California centuries (100-mile 
rides), such as the Solvang Century scheduled Saturday in Solvang, draw more 
than 3,000 cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
What's the fascination? Why are so many people spending every spare minute 
riding the thin line between pleasure and pain? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Leach, an Olympic kayaker and former All-American in water polo at UC 
Irvine who is now one of the world's top-ranked master triathletes, provides a 
number of reasons . . . some of them somewhat contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I like the freedom and the speed of bicycling," he said. "It's a 
great outlet for stress and frustrations and, of course, there's the fitness 
aspect. But you can't underestimate the aspect of solitude. It gives you time 
to be with yourself and enjoy your surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there's the social part, too. It's a great way to see things with 
your family or spend time with friends." 
</P>
<P>
Most cyclists prefer not to ride alone and, as a result, clubs are flourishing. 
The Capistrano Ciclistas, one of many Orange County clubs, was formed in the 
mid-1970s during the last cycling resurgence. It remained active with a few 
die-hard members through the doldrums of the early '80s, but its roster has 
increased in recent years to 80 members. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Neville of San Clemente joined Capistrano Ciclistas when he decided 
bicycling would be a good way to reverse the effects of smoking two packs of 
cigarettes a day for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling is an endorphin popper," he said. "It brings you in tune with 
yourself, with your abilities. The mechanical application is also intriguing. 
The bicycle is a beautiful piece of equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Neville, who quit his job and began his own business as an advertising and 
marketing consultant specializing in cycling, pedals at least 130 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
But he still curses his old habits when pushing his way up a tough hill. "Peter 
can be very bad-tempered on hills," said Rock Kendall, of Dana Point, smiling. 
"You don't want to talk to him on hills." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, who started cycling as a training regimen when he was racing 
catamarans, says he now rides more than he sails. He believes most noncyclists 
believe the misconception that long-distance riding is a form of torture. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to exert yourself to the point of pain," Kendall said. "You 
gradually work your way up. I'm riding in my first century this weekend, my 
last hurrah before I turn 40 this June, but I don't expect it to hurt. I hate 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to ride so much because it's fun. You're outside in the sun with your 
friends. The camaraderie is the best part of it." 
</P>
<P>
And being outdoors seems to add to the calming effect of all that exercise. 
When cyclists talk about health clubs, they cringe at the thought of gulping 
air conditioning when you can work out with fresh air filling your lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Even a few whiffs of exhaust fumes won't change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still lots of places in Orange County where you can ride without 
traffic or signals, especially down by the beach," said Larry Keller, a 
computer consultant from Huntington Beach. "I don't mind riding alone, either. 
I have a lot of pressure in my job and this is a great release. Who needs a 
psychiatrist when you've got a bike?" 
</P>
<P>
Alone or in groups, cyclists share a common fear: accidents. They are not 
uncommon and they are often serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who's been on a bike more than a few hours can tell you about 
situations where they could have been really hurt," Leach said. "I really think 
that's one of the attractions for some people, the thrill that comes with 
taking chances, with testing oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I still see people who don't wear helmets and that's just plain 
stupid . . . or insane." 
</P>
<P>
Leach's wife, Julie, teaches a recreational cycling class at Irvine Valley 
College. She starts by showing her students how to change a tire and works her 
way to effective gearing techniques. But she stresses defensive riding and 
safety, and helmets are mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
"The new hard-shell helmets are so cool, comfortable and light that there's 
absolutely no excuse not to wear one," she said. "You can't even tell it's on 
after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Serious cyclists won't downplay the risks, but they invariably will tell you 
that the benefits far outweigh the liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I know has been hurt except me," said Pam Weiss of San Juan 
Capistrano, pointing to the raspberry on the knee of companion David Swerdlin, 
who had recently been caught in a squeeze play between a truck and a curb. "And 
no, I don't get any excitement from the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss says she is aware that only 12% of cycling accidents involve a car and 
that road debris and other cyclists cause more mishaps. Still, she would rather 
deal with a stray beer bottle than a straying Buick. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry more about cars than trash," she said. "I'm pretty confident I can 
survive an accident caused by road debris." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight million Americans ride bicycles, but only 5 million to 10 million 
do it on a weekly basis. Are they lazy or afraid of traffic? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it would be safer to ride a stationary bike, if you can stand the 
health-club scene," said Ron Klefbeck, president of the Capistrano Ciclistas, 
"but there's no downhills and I wouldn't be riding if it wasn't for the 
downhills. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't care what kind of fancy TV monitor you've got in front of you, 
riding a stationary bike is boring." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so you've decided to pedal away your frustrations, worries, stress and 
excess pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now what? Get out the checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a bike ($250 to ($1,800), a helmet ($30-$100), biking shorts 
($30-$150), gloves ($10-$30), road cleats ($60-$300) and sunglasses (Oakley 
Factory Pilots look cool for about $70, but almost any pair will do). 
</P>
<P>
A tire repair kit, frame-mounted pump and water bottle are also near-mandatory 
items. 
</P>
<P>
All of these cycling accessories do more than make you look the part. The 
shorts prevent chafing; gloves add comfort and reduce abrasions in a fall; 
shoes enhance comfort and efficiency, and the sunglasses reduce the effects of 
ultraviolet rays while providing protection from airborne debris. 
</P>
<P>
It's also advisable to buy your bike from a bicycle shop because fitting is 
important. An ill-fitting bike can result in any number of aches and pains and 
even cause numbness in the hands. 
</P>
<P>
Most cyclists who pedal long distances prefer the regular road frame (what used 
to be called a "10-speed"), but the newer mountain-bike style is growing in 
popularity because the rider sits more upright, which many find more 
comfortable than the hunched over style of the road cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
Some hybrid cycles, merging the road and mountain-bike designs, are on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a quality, entry-level bike for $400," said Tracy Sledge, a 
salesman in a Laguna Beach bike shop. "And get a helmet the same day. Shorts 
should probably be next, and make sure you get a pair with a good liner that 
will keep the moisture away from your body. After that you can add gloves and 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, investing the money will be less painful than investing the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to start easy and keep it fun, but I see more and more people 
sticking to it," said Julie Leach. "I think people are more motivated now 
because they're more health conscious. Things I was learning in college, like 
the impact of cholesterol levels, are common knowledge now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are getting bored with health clubs and what's more healthy 
than fresh air? And cycling is a lot more comfortable than running." 
</P>
<P>
This time of the year, cyclists all over the country are looking out windows at 
snow drifts. But here in the Southland, the rolling masses are chalking up 
hundreds of miles each week. 
</P>
<P>
And every day, more decide to go along for the ride.
