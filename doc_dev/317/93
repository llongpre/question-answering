   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's son started
college this week and was accused of cheating even before he
attended a class, took an exam or cracked a textbook.
   A right-wing opposition party gearing up for parliamentary
elections expected by year's end is alleging the prime minister used
his clout to help his 17-year-old son, Rahul, get into the elite St.
Stephen's College.
   Admission is highly competitive and only about 1,350 students
attend the three-year college, located on the tree-shaded campus of
Delhi University.
   College officials say Rahul, whose entrance exams suggest he
shoots a pistol better than he solves a math problem, gained
admission through a limited quota set aside for athletes.
   ``The sports quota is just a ruse to accommodate the privileged
sections of the society,'' said Madan Lal Khurana of the Bharatiya
Janata Party, or the Indian People's Party.
   The college, Khurana added, doesn't even have a shooting team.
   But Prem Sagar Dwivedi, a history professor and member of the
college panel that selected the 390-member freshman class, dismissed
the suggestions and said the college has a shooting club that meets
regularly.
   ``Rahul's bona fides as a sportsman cannot be doubted. I haven't
heard anyone inside or outside the college questioning Rahul's
credentials,'' Dwivedi said.
   Rahul won three gold medals in a pistol shooting competiton
conducted by the Delhi State Rifle Association in November 1988. A
month later, he finished fourth in a national firing tournament held
by the National Rifle Association of India, the highest-ranking body
for the sport.
   For Rahul, going to college allows him to emerge from a highly
sheltered, well guarded cocoon. He plans to study history and will
attend day classes and then return to his family's official
residence.
   Rahul attended a private boy's school run by Roman Catholic
priests until 1982, when threats were made by Sikh extremists
against the Gandhi family. His grandmother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was assassinated on Oct. 31, 1984, and his father was
elected to succeed her.
   Rahul and his 18-year-old sister, Priyanka, were tutored at home.
Priyanka is studying psychology at a women's college in New Delhi.
   To counter opposition charges, the governing Congress Party
sponsored a welcome ceremony for Rahul on Monday, the first day of
classes.
   Party members hung banners saying ``Welcome Rahul Gandhi, the
Voice of Students.''
   Reporters were ordered to leave the campus when Rahul arrived in
a bulletproof car, accompanied by five bodyguards.
   He was greeted by several seniors who took him to the cafeteria
and cornered and bullied him for at least two hours in a tradition
for new students known as ``ragging'' and similar to hazing.
   ``Rahul was badly ragged by some unsavory elements. But I must
say he took it very sportingly,'' said Sanjoy Bhattacharya, a senior
history student.
   Since the controversy over Rahul's admission started, fellow
students have spoken out on his behalf.
   ``I don't like the way the opposition is carrying on the
anti-Rahul campaign. The poor chap hasn't had a normal education and
if he wants to attend a proper college now, what's wrong?''
Bhattacharya said. ``Give the poor guy a chance.''
   The Indian press, frequently critical of his father, has sprung
to Rahul's defense.
   ``One can only wish him well and hope he is able to lead as
normal a college life as possible, making friends with a wide
cross-section of people along the way,'' said The Sunday Observer, a
respected English-language weekly.
   Dwivedi said: ``Why all this fuss? Prime ministers' sons go to
college all over the world.''
