<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 205 pounds;   PERSONAL: Married 44 years. He has four grown
children, seven grandchildren, and lives in Cupertino;   OCCUPATION:
President, Foothill College in Los Altos Hills;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: Pick-up
sports were his primary source of exercise, he says, until 20 years ago, when
he hurt his back playing volleyball. After surgery, he says, he was "in bad
shape for quite a while." For therapy, Clements started swimming laps every
day. Although he found it "terminally boring," he stayed with it for seven
years. As his strength and flexibility returned, he began to run several times
a week. On alternate days, he would swim. But when his hip and knee joints
started "talking to me," he knew it was time to find another routine.;   Right
after Clements joined students for a midday Nautilus class at school, he knew
he'd found a great workout that was kind to his joints. And five years later,
"Dr. Clements" the student became "Tom" the teacher. "It kills two birds with
one stone," he says, because he doesn't charge the university for teaching. In
the process of staying fit, it benefits the college financially.;   REGIMEN:
After leading an hour of instruction, five days a week, Clements works out
another 40 minutes on his own. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he spends
20 minutes on a stationary bike before moving through 14 different exercise
stations. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he rides the bike the entire time.;  
Weekends include a lot physical activity, too, he says, because they are kept
open for his grandchildren. Instead of a "'honey, do" list, his grown children
have a "daddy, do" list that keeps him busy building playhouses and working on
other projects.;   RESULTS: "I'm doing pretty well for a guy my age. I have
muscle tone and strength, a high energy level and, as long as I don't do
anything stupid, my back is fine.";   GOALS: "To keep the pump going." He's
not "red hot" about retiring, but when he does and if it works out, he'd like
to continue teaching the class.;   OBSTACLES: "Big lunches make me fight sleep
during afternoon meetings." Otherwise, even on days he's dragging, he doesn't
skip. A good workout is an "upper" for the rest of the day.;   TIPS AND
COMMENTS: Unlike most other colleges that require two physical education
classes to graduate, Foothill requires four. Clements keeps after friends,
co-workers and students about the benefits of regular exercise and, so far, he
says, "I keep my classes full."  </TEXT>
