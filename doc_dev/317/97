   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on Bob Dole's role in the
Senate:
   President-elect George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole ``kissed and made
up'' ... _ for the time being. Insiders predict it will be
impossible for Dole to bite his tongue for the next four years.
   Back when they were political equals on the wintry campaign trail
in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two were at each others' throats. Now
that Bush has grabbed the brass ring, Dole must be satisfied with an
attendant role as Senate minority leader.
   In that role, his first assignment will be to embrace the new
president's claim that the nation's $155 billion budget deficit can
be reduced significantly without new taxes.
   His doubts about that proposition are well known and it seems
only a matter of time before he finds some embarrassing riposte that
will torpedo this chummy relationship with the White House.
   The GOP must swim upstream in the Democratic-controlled 101st
Congress, so Dole's cooperation would be a plus for the Bush
administration.
   Bush proved his chameleon qualities when he swallowed his pride
and disappeared in President Reagan's shadow eight years ago. Dole
is more stubborn and less restrained, so be surprised if he finds
this kind of political fidelity too demanding and kicks the traces.

   The Milwaukee Journal on college athletes:
   In their quest to win careers as professional football or
basketball players, too many college students are setting themselves
up for failure in life. That's the sad but clear message that
emerges from a new study of 4,083 students at 42 major U.S. colleges
and universities.
   The $1.75 million study was conducted for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
   It found that major college football and basketball players spend
more time on their sports during the season than they do studying
and attending class. ...
   To anyone who follows college sports, these findings come as no
surprise. But they do provide a factual basis for action by the
NCAA, and action is needed.
   When college students spend more time on sports than on academic
work, they twist their priorities, and so do the schools they
attend. ...
   For athletes as for others, a rewarding life in this complex era
requires an education _ not necessarily a college education, but at
least a skill that will not become obsolete fairly quickly. That's
why students need to spend most of their time studying.
   When they neglect the development of these lasting skills, they
are doing themselves no favor. And colleges that permit such
distorted priorities aren't helping, either.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on college athletes:
   College jocks spend more time on the job than they do in
classwork. This, ahem, startling bit of news was delivered to the
nation by a commission of presidents of the nation's largest
colleges and universities.
   The NCAA Presidents Commission ... surveyed 4,083 college
athletes and students from 42 of the largest colleges and
universities.
   The research showed jocks spend an average of 30 hours a week on
their football and basketball sports, while they spend only 12 hours
studying and 14 hours in classes.
   College presidents need to find something to do to fill out their
idle days, obviously. ...
   The only differences between college jocks and college students
is that the students are preparing for a later job. The jocks
already have one, though the pay is convoluted because of the
hypocrisy surrounding the job.
