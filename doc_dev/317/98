   He was notably a busy man on the high-minded
Swarthmore campus, which would have surprised no one who'd seen
Michael Dukakis in action at Brookline High. He was big in sports,
big in student government and long on A's. In high school and
college, he was always reckoned among the brainiest. But, active as
he was, he was never ``a rah-rah guy,'' as a college friend
recalls. ``He'd rather do something about an issue.''

   Looking back on those halcyon (also the
name of the yearbook) days, college chums are undecided whether
Michael's barber shop on the third floor of Wharton Hall or courses
nicknamed ``Ditch Digging and Sewage Disposal 1 &amp; 2'' gave distant
early warning of a future Democratic presidential candidate.
   Of course it was the ``D'' in general physics that discouraged
freshman Michael Dukakis from becoming a physician, like his Greek
immigrant father, and inspired Swarthmore's now best-selling
T-shirt: ``Anywhere else, it would have been an A.''
   Practical politics, solving problems in state and local
government, as taught in the early '50s by Paul Ylvisaker,
intrigued the scholarship student who had graduated second in a
class of 439 at intellectually top-drawer Brookline High School in
the suburbs of Boston.
   In a matter of weeks, Michael, who in those days was never
called ``Duke'' and rarely ``Mike,'' was ringing doorbells in West
Philadelphia and handing out campaign literature for Joe Clark, the
reform candidate who became the first Democrat in 70 years to
capture Philadelphia's city hall.
   ``Swarthmore has always been pretty liberal, an egghead campus
where kids think they can change the world,'' says Leighton
Whitaker, who was a year ahead of Dukakis and now is director of
psychological services at the college. ``But Michael wasn't a
rah-rah guy. He'd sooner do something about an issue than attend
rallies and demonstrations.''
   ``Theory wasn't his bag,'' adds professor emeritus J. Roland
Pennock, summoning up a memory of a dark-eyed lad seated
Buddha-style on his living room floor for those afternoon seminars
on political theory. ``His arguments were sound, well-researched,
but he was less aggressive and less talkative without a real
problem to sink his teeth into.''
   Actually it was Jonathan Fine, his Brookline buddy and now head
of Physicians for Human Rights, who proposed boycotting the three
barber shops down in ``the vill,'' the village, when they refused
to cut the hair of three Nigerian students. Dukakis made it work by
wielding the comb and clippers in the dorm and sometimes out on the
lawn.
   Some recall his charging 50 cents, others say 65 cents, for a
``flattop,'' the only styling offered.
   ``There may have been a two-tier price structure, depending on
what the trade would bear,'' mused associate provost emeritus
Gilmore Stott, who as admissions officer back then coaxed Dukakis
into entering Swarthmore over a dinner cooked by his wife, Mary.
``He was being penny-wise as well as striking a blow for racial
equality. Barbering gave him some pocket money.''
   Classmate Ted Perkins, a Philadelphia patent attorney, surmises
the barber of Wharton may have been a youthful edition of the
tightwad governor who picks his suits off the rack, still shops for
specials at the supermarket, grew his own lettuce on the front lawn
when the price hit 89 cents a head, pushes a 25-year-old snow
blower and often rides ``the T,'' the suburban trolley, from
Brookline to the Massachusetts State House.
   ``But with a captive audience in the chair, Michael never could
resist politics,'' Perkins recalls. ``Frank Sieverts, his roommate,
told us the hotter the argument got, the faster the hair flew.''
   A couple of Christmas cards ago, Dean Stott enclosed a $1
campaign contribution, suggesting Dukakis run for president. ``I
like being governor,'' the reply came back but, Stott says, ``he
kept the dollar.''
   Swarthmore is a small college, then as now with only about half
of Brookline High's 2,000 enrollment, but lush as a landscape from
the brush of colonial painter Benjamin West, whose house is at the
edge of the 380-acre campus that flourishes as an arboretum of rare
trees. Daffodils, azaleas, dogtooth violets, lilacs and
rhododendrons in seasonal succession perfume the paths of Crum
Woods, where in the delicate euphemism of the Halcyon editors
``couples took field trips in Baudelaire.''
   Dukakis was attracted by the beauty of the campus when, as a
high school senior, he visited Philadelphia for a week in a class
exchange program. That Swarthmore was coed and small enough for
almost half the student body to take part in varsity sports also
proved persuasive.
   Brookline High had conditioned him for Swarthmore's heady
intellectual climate.
   ``He was brilliant, got all A's _ isn't that disgusting?''
marvels Sandra Cohen, now Bakalar, his high school sweetheart. She
was secretary of the student council when Dukakis solved the
problem of broken milk bottles in the lunch room by having the
distributor deliver paper cartons. ``But Michael lost a big
election in senior year: Bob Wool beat him out for class
president.''
