EL CAMINO'S NIU SALE: HE'S REAL COOL -- UNTIL THE GAME GETS GOING; 
</P>
<P>

47.

<P>
Seeing Niu Sale out of his football attire can be deceiving. The 19-year old 
sophomore from Carson appears relaxed, carefree and cool. Very cool. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week El Camino's All-American defensive back strutted across 
campus in a white tank top, black shorts, thongs and a large straw hat. A 
goatee, dark glasses and a black hoop earring complimented the outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a mellow guy," Sale said smiling. "I'm just relaxed all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not all the time. He laughs often and has a silly pre-game ritual -- he 
eats a big hamburger with cheese and chicken nuggets before every game -- but 
when it comes to football, he's a very intense individual. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a winner," said El Camino co-defensive coordinator Steve Schmitz. "That's 
the bottom line. No matter where you put him, he'll do everything in his power 
to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
On the field the sturdy athlete seldom speaks. Actions do that for him whether 
he's returning a punt, holding the ball for a field goal or jumping on a ball 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"In football you don't talk with your mouth," Sale said. "You talk with your 
helmet. We wear Bike (brand) helmets so I tell the guys on the other team 'come 
ride a bike,' and when I get a good play I say 'you just rode a bike.' They 
hate it and they curse all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Negative words from bitter opponents don't bother Sale, whose large photo 
appears on the front of the Warriors' media guide. His performance is always 
top-notch. Aggression and quickness are his main trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
"When we need to put out the fire or make a big play," said Head Coach John 
Featherstone, "he always comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone says there aren't many football players with Sale's ability and 
dedication. The Warriors' fifth-year coach believes Sale is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching junior college football for 14 years," he said, "and I 
really don't think I've seen a finer athlete than Niu. He's just a gifted, 
natural athlete." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, Sale is not dominating, but speed and strength make 
up for his lack of size. He had 93 tackles and four interceptions last year as 
an All-American and all-Mission Conference free safety. 
</P>
<P>
This season he leads the Warriors in tackles with 47, despite playing behind a 
tough front line that includes all-conference defensive end Jeff Cummins and 
tackles Eric Marrero and Elgin Loften. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding player," said Golden West Coach Ray Shackleford. "I'm sure 
he's one of their best guys and they have a great team. He's very quick and 
he's always around the football." 
</P>
<P>
In El Camino's 31-24 victory over Fullerton, Sale had 11 tackles although he 
was moved to strong safety because Anthony Anetema, who starts at that 
position, cracked a wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Sale also had an outstanding performance (14 tackles) in the Warriors' 38-14 
win over Golden West and last week, when El Camino whipped Southwestern, he 
returned a punt 47 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for big plays aren't always easy to come by considering Sale is 
up against Anetema, a childhood friend, who was an all-conference strong safety 
last season with 96 tackles. Ed Togia (78 tackles last year), an all-conference 
linebacker, also makes his share of tackles before Sale even sees the man. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior co-defensive coordinator Walt Justice calls it El Camino's best defense 
in his six years at the school. It's played a tremendous role in the Warriors' 
success, even though they possess the state's second-best offense. El Camino is 
5-0 (4-0 in conference) and ranked No. 1 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau 
and No.2 in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
"Our other great defense," Justice said, "was in 1987 (when El Camino won the 
national championship). This year we even have more depth in our starters. We 
have seven or eight stars instead of just one or two." 
</P>
<P>
Justice says Sale is the best defensive back he's seen at El Camino. The other 
top back in recent history was all-American Bill Hughley, who went on to Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"Niu is more disciplined than Bill," Justice said. "He's always in control. He 
has something you just don't teach. He has great instinct for the game and 
great knowledge of it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because he's been playing for 10 years, starting with flag football 
at age 9. Sale and his older brother Ken, 21, competed in Carson leagues and 
both played at Bishop Montgomery High. 
</P>
<P>
Ken, a linebacker, played at El Camino in 1986 and 1987 and now leads the 
University of Texas, El Paso (UTEP), in tackles (99 for the season). The 
brothers played together for one season at Bishop Montgomery and both were 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Sale was an all-around man for the Knights and a three-time all-Angelus League 
selection. He was successful as a defensive back, quarterback, tailback and 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game at quarterback, as a junior, Sale led Bishop Montgomery to a 
27-0 win over Mary Star by rushing for all of the Knights' touchdowns. As a 
senior tailback he gained 240 yards in a game against Servite High. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Szabatura, the coach at Bishop Montgomery when Sale played there, says 
he's never seen a more versatile football player. 
</P>
<P>
"We used him everywhere," said Szabatura who's an offensive coordinator at St. 
John Bosco in Bellflower. "He was one of the best option quarterbacks I've ever 
had. He's the best athlete I've been associated with in my 10-year coaching 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Sale was good enough to play in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. as a 
freshman, but didn't qualify academically. Several schools recruited him as a 
defensive back, including UTEP, Tennessee and the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 48 he would have been forced to sit out one season. The NCAA 
rule stipulates that incoming freshmen must score at least 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test (higher or lower depending on grade-point average) and 
Sale didn't meet that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here (El Camino)," he said, "because I wanted to stay in shape. I 
didn't want to just sit around for a year. I could never do that." 
</P>
<P>
The colleges that wanted him out of high school still want him. In addition 
Sale has received letters from UC Berkeley, Syracuse, Washington State and 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't decided where he'll go, but he wants to leave the state to "see 
what's out there." For now though, he's preoccupied with his performance at El 
Camino. He wants to leave as a two-time all-American. 
</P>
<P>
Szabatura says anyone who knows Sale knows he can do it. His exceptional drive 
and ability make it possible, the coach says. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a better hitter out there," Szabatura said. "This is the type of 
kid that delivers pops, big pops." 
</P>
<P>
You'd never think that if you saw him out of his pads and helmet, though.
