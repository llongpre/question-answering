<P>
The second-best 3-year-old in New York will stay in his barn today while his 
heralded stablemate, Easy Goer, is expected to become the shortest-priced horse 
ever to win the Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having won five of seven starts, including the Flamingo Stakes at 
Hialeah in his last race, Awe Inspiring is still playing second banana to Easy 
Goer, who has won six out of eight. The horses have the same ownership -- Ogden 
Phipps and his son, Dinny -- and are both trained by Shug McGaughey, who has 
repeatedly said that only Easy Goer will run in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill 
Downs two weeks from today. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey can see no sense running Awe Inspiring as an entry in the $500,000 
Wood, the last of four major preps for the Derby, even though second-place 
money at Aqueduct is more than $100,000. Awe Inspiring would probably finish 
second if he ran, because the other five horses in the field are second-raters. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Diamond Donnie, ran second, 13 lengths behind Easy Goer, two weeks 
ago, and the others also have modest credentials. Triple Buck is winless this 
year, Rock Point has won three of 11 lifetime starts and A.M. Swinger and 
Militron couldn't beat lesser opposition at Garden State Park just a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring easily beat better horses than these when he won the Flamingo by 
three lengths on March 25, the same day McGaughey was saddling Easy Goer for 
his near-world-record 1:32 2/5 mile in the Gotham here. 
</P>
<P>
The Flamingo is also a major prep for the Derby, and in most years Awe 
Inspiring would be on his way to Louisville as one of the favorites in 
America's premier race. This year, Awe Inspiring would be either the third or 
fourth betting choice -- behind Easy Goer and Santa Anita Derby winner Sunday 
Silence and possibly ahead of Blue Grass winner Western Playboy -- if he ran in 
the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what he does, though, Awe Inspiring is being upstaged by Easy Goer. 
The other day at Belmont Park, where McGaughey trains his horses, Awe Inspiring 
turned in an effective half-mile workout in :48 4/5, but 24 hours later, Easy 
Goer covered the same distance 2 3/5 seconds faster. 
</P>
<P>
After Awe Inspiring's workout, a story in the Daily Racing Form hinted that 
McGaughey might be changing his mind about the Derby for his No. 2 colt, but in 
an interview Thursday, the trainer discounted that. Ogden Phipps, who is 80, 
reportedly would not care if Awe Inspiring, who races in his son's name, were 
to run in the Derby, but the decision has been left to McGaughey. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably enter both colts in the Derby," McGaughey said. "But only Easy 
Goer will run. If anything should happen to Easy Goer -- God forbid -- or if 
the track came up muddy, then it's possible that Awe Inspiring could run." 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey concedes that Awe Inspiring has developed faster than he thought he 
would. He won in his first start, in a maiden race at Belmont last September, 
but by then Easy Goer already had two victories on his record. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring was fourth in his second start, on an off track, and McGaughey 
didn't race him the rest of his 2-year-old year. This winter at Gulfstream 
Park, the son of Slew o' Gold won two allowance races in less than three weeks 
and both jockey Jose Santos and his agent, Frank Sanabria, were saying that 
this might be their Derby horse. 
</P>
<P>
But when Awe Inspiring had a rough trip and finished 10th in his first stake, 
the Fountain of Youth, Santos picked another horse, Kerosene, to ride in the 
Everglades. Under Craig Perret, Awe Inspiring beat Kerosene by three lengths, 
and the distance between them was the same in the Flamingo. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey didn't think Awe Inspiring was ready to run in the Florida Derby, 
which was two weeks after the Fountain of Youth, or the colt might have won 
that race, too. 
</P>
<P>
Racing lore is crammed with stories of trainers whose second-best horses turned 
out to be something. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1973 Wood, Lucien Laurin started both Secretariat and Angle Light, 
because they had different owners. Secretariat had beaten Angle Light three 
times when they were 2-year-olds, and the future Triple Crown champion went 
into the Wood with a 10-race winning streak, having been beaten only in the 
first race of his career. 
</P>
<P>
It was not widely known that Secretariat had been bothered by an abscessed 
tooth. In the stretch, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey, was looking around 
for Sham, the horse he thought they had to beat, when Angle Light surprised 
them and won by a head. Sham was second, four lengths ahead of Secretariat, who 
lost only three more races before he was retired. 
</P>
<P>
Secretariat reaffirmed his superiority over Angle Light in the Kentucky Derby. 
The next year, in the centennial running of the Derby, Woody Stephens ran 
Judger and Cannonade as an entry. Judger had run down his stablemate in the 
stretch of the Florida Derby, and was a big winner in the Blue Grass the week 
before the Kentucky Derby. But at Churchill Downs, Cannonade gave Stephens his 
first Derby win and Judger ran eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Stephens has made a career of winning with his second string, 
especially during the 1980s, when he won the Belmont Stakes five consecutive 
times. Stephens got his other Derby win in 1984 with Swale, who had played 
Pancho to Devil's Bag's Cisco Kid when they were 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring are flown to Louisville from New York next 
Wednesday, one horse should be put in business class and the other ought to be 
flying tourist. In racing, though, the way horses are perceived or travel 
doesn't always jibe with the turns that their careers take. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris Antley, who doesn't have a mount in the Wood, rode the winner of the 
seventh race Friday, extending his record to 57 consecutive days with at least 
one winner at Aqueduct. . . . The track is expected to be fast today. . . . The 
shortest-priced winner of the Wood has been Native Dancer, who paid $2.20 when 
he won in 1953. Easy Goer paid $2.10 -- the minimum -- in winning the Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
Manastash Ridge, with Robbie Davis riding, is the 2-1 favorite today in the 
$400,000 Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. The colt carries 123 pounds, three 
less than Trapp Mountain, Double Quick and Clever Trevor, who are co-high 
weights in the 11-horse field. . . . In the $250,000 California Derby at Golden 
Gate Fields, Flying Continental is the 7-5 favorite, with Laffit Pincay seeking 
his fourth victory in the race. Flying Continental, second in the Santa Anita 
Derby, carries 117 pounds, two less than Endow in an eight-horse field.
