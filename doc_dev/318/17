Shug McGaughey was in a surprisingly good mood at his Belmont Park barn 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure, McGaughey should be chipper, since he trains Easy Goer, the heavy 
favorite in Saturday's $500,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and the odds-on 
favorite for the Kentucky Derby, which will be run at Churchill Downs May 6. 
</P>
<P>
But a trainer is never devoid of worries, and even a trainer with a horse as 
fast as Easy Goer can frown some. Cases in point, as far as McGaughey is 
concerned: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Jane McGaughey, the trainer's wife and Easy Goer's exercise rider 
until she became too great with child, is scheduled to deliver their second 
baby in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seeking the Gold, a top 3-year-old last year and a horse expected to be one 
of the country's best handicap runners this year, jammed his ankle in Florida 
last month, just about the time he was going to make his 1989 debut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grand Gala, a talented 3-year-old filly who was being pointed for the 
Kentucky Oaks, the day before the Derby, hurt a knee while running at Keeneland 
recently and underwent arthroscopic surgery for removal of a bone chip Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Easy Goer, in his final workout before the Wood, breezed a half-mile 
Thursday at Belmont in :46 1/5, which was two or three seconds faster than 
McGaughey wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McGaughey was smiling at an early hour in his barn office. The 
opposition in the Wood is so nondescript that McGaughey's colt should be able 
to spot the others an extra-quick workout and still thrash them. The best of 
Easy Goer's five rivals may be Diamond Donnie, and he ran second, 13 lengths 
behind Easy Goer, at Aqueduct two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/8-mile Wood will be only the second time around two turns for Easy Goer 
-- he was second, after a bad start in the mud, in the 1 1/16-mile Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs last November -- but McGaughey does not believe 
that this will be a factor. Neither does Aqueduct's track handicapper, who has 
made the son of Alydar a 1-9 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, McGaughey chastised David Carroll, Easy Goer's current 
exercise rider, when the trainer thought the colt had worked too fast at 
Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing the best I can but I just can't hold him," Carroll told McGaughey. 
</P>
<P>
So when Easy Goer and Carroll went considerably faster than McGaughey's 
expectations Thursday, the trainer accepted the workout calmly. "He was still 
running well within himself," McGaughey said. "A good horse like this one just 
runs that fast, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
It was a morning that called for Barbra Streisand -- one of those rare New York 
days so clear that you could see forever. Outside the barn after the workout, 
Mary Jane McGaughey, dressed in jeans and a floppy T-shirt that advertised her 
condition, held Easy Goer's lead shank while a groom hosed the horse's ankles 
in a bright spring sunshine that made the colt's butterscotch coat glisten. 
</P>
<P>
A battalion of photographers shot the horse from every angle, as they might a 
model in a swimsuit, and Easy Goer just stood there with his handlers, 
impervious to the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's coat is not as bright as the near-red appearance of Secretariat, 
the 1973 Triple Crown champion with whom McGaughey's horse has been frequently 
compared. But just standing still, Easy Goer is a stunning animal. He has what 
horsemen generically call a star in the middle of his forehead, although the 
white marking could pass for a catawampus triangle. If McGaughey were given a 
Rorschach test with the same pattern, he might say that it resembles a map of 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey mentioned Secretariat. "I know Secretariat got beat in the Wood but 
that's the reason a horse wins and pays $100 sometimes," he said. "But I sure 
don't expect this horse to lose Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he expect Easy Goer to lose at Churchill Downs two weeks from now. 
Easy Goer has run eight times, losing twice, and one of the defeats was at the 
Louisville track, but he still was a fast-closing second to Is It True that day 
and McGaughey has dismissed the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's other defeat was in the first race of his career, going six 
furlongs at Belmont last August, when he also broke slowly and came from behind 
but lost by a nose to a 2-year-old who wasn't even nominated for this year's 
Triple Crown races. Is It True was injured in his Breeders' Cup win over Easy 
Goer and only recently returned to the races. 
</P>
<P>
In his second start, Easy Goer was a winner at Saratoga -- his first of three 
victories over the same Is It True -- and McGaughey thought there was something 
wrong with the track timer when it showed 1:22 3/5 for seven furlongs. Three 
weeks later, however, when Easy Goer ran a 6 1/2-furlong race back at Belmont 
in a sparkling 1:15 2/5, McGaughey knew that the Saratoga clock didn't need to 
be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Moving into stakes competition, Easy Goer romped in the Cowdin and Champagne at 
Belmont before his 2-year-old season ended with the 1 1/4-length defeat in the 
Breeders' Cup. He still won the Eclipse Award as the year's best 2-year-old 
colt. Easy Goer has won his six races by a total of 36 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey, 38, trains for the Phipps family -- Ogden and his son, Dinny -- and 
he went to Florida with Easy Goer and the rest of their horses for the winter. 
The plan was to race Easy Goer lightly, skipping the Florida Derby and the 
Flamingo, Florida's two major preps for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer raced on Florida Derby day at Gulfstream, but it was in the 
seven-furlong Swale Stakes, and he won easily, being clocked in 1:22 1/5. Then 
Easy Goer was shipped North and he blew their doors off in the Gotham on April 
8, running the mile in 1:32 2/5, which missed breaking Dr. Fager's 21-year-old 
world record by a fifth of a second. 
</P>
