ROB AN PLUNDER'S 7-RACE STREAK IS MISLEADING

When a 2-year-old wins 7 straight races, there's usually a coast-to-coast 
clamor about his prospects as a Kentucky Derby candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Rob an Plunder, a high-strung colt, began winning in a maiden race at Hollywood 
Park last July and hasn't lost since, but his streak has made nary a ripple, in 
California or elsewhere. In the recent Eclipse Awards voting, he wasn't even 
considered. In Las Vegas, you can get 40-1 odds on Rob an Plunder to win the 
Kentucky Derby. There are about 2 dozen horses with shorter prices in the 
future book. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Rob an Plunder will be favored Sunday in the $300,000 El Camino 
Real Derby at Bay Meadows is that undefeated King Glorious, California's 
pre-eminent Kentucky Derby prospect and currently 10-1 in Las Vegas, is on the 
sidelines with a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
Had King Glorious been ready to run Sunday, Rob an Plunder's trainer, Jim 
Benedict, would have skipped the El Camino Real and run in a stake for 
California-breds at Santa Anita last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Rob an Plunder's winning streak, which includes 6 stakes races, has been put 
together for the most part against third-rate opposition. The only significant 
race on the list was the Balboa at Del Mar in August. And that day, Bruho was 
the best horse, but he zig-zagged at the top of the stretch and dumped his 
rider, Gary Stevens, enabling Rob an Plunder to romp home. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Rob an Plunder's wins, at Bay Meadows, was the result of Big 
Conviction's disqualification for interference. Big Conviction had finished 
first by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
Since Rob an Plunder cost only $6,000 as a yearling and has earned $224,800, 
his owners know they have a bargain, but they are not deluding themselves about 
their horse being in King Glorious' class. The second and last time Rob an 
Plunder lost, at Golden Gate Fields in June, he finished 10 lengths behind King 
Glorious. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the strategy for Rob an Plunder has been simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike your daughter, you want your horse to keep the worst possible company," 
is the way Don Eidson, one of the colt's owners, explains it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Rob an Plunder, the small field for the El Camino Real Derby is also 
expected to include Hawkster and Stephen's Sooner, who couldn't beat King 
Glorious in the Hollywood Futurity last month. Other probables are Double 
Quick, Base Camp and Harmony Creek, who will run only if the track is dry. This 
is unlikely, since Bay Meadows has been muddy and more rain is forecast for the 
Bay Area for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly, the filly who has been unsuccessful in 4 starts since winning 
the Del Mar Debutante in September and then being disqualified for 
interference, has an outside chance to run, but she probably will go instead in 
the $100,000 Bay Meadows Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
All the early 3-year-old racing in Florida has proved is that there's no 
apparent quality in depth behind Easy Goer, the champion 2-year-colt for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Big Stanley, the winner of Sunday's Tropical Park Derby, has won 4 of his last 
5 starts, but all of his races have been run at Calder, where the top horses 
seldom run. 
</P>
<P>
Winners Laugh, who ran second twice to Easy Goer last fall, and Mercedes Won, 
who won the Sanford and Hopeful at Saratoga in August, were both beaten by 
Halrose, a lightly regarded Canadian import, on opening day at Gulfstream Park 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who hasn't run since finishing second to Is It True in the Breeders' 
Cup, isn't likely to run in the Florida Derby at Gulfstream on March 4, but 
will probably race in the Swale, a 7-furlong race there the same day. After 
that, Easy Goer is expected to take a New York route to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, the 9-year-old gelding who has run only 34 times because of 
physical problems, will make his first start since finishing third in last 
year's Santa Anita Handicap when he runs Saturday in the $100,000 San Carlos 
Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, who has earned $1.3 million with 15 wins, has been assigned 123 
pounds. The high weight at 126 pounds in the 7-furlong San Carlos is On the 
Line, who has won 3 straight since an ankle crack was repaired with a pin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday at Santa Anita, a large field will run in the $200,000, 1 1/8-mile 
San Fernando, which is the second leg of the Strub series for 4-year-olds and 
the first major stake at the track this season. Among the starters is Oraibi, 
who won the Malibu, the first race in the threesome that concludes with the 
Strub on Feb. 5. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Very Subtle, a possibility for the $100,000 Santa Monica Handicap on Monday at 
Santa Anita, has earned $1.5 million, more than any filly or mare in training. 
Lady's Secret holds the filly-mare record for earnings with $3 million. . . . 
Although Alex Solis has been suspended 5 days by the Santa Anita stewards, 
through Sunday, he will be able to ride in the weekend stakes at Bay Meadows 
because of California's designated-race rule. Solis has calls on Bright Asset 
in the Bay Meadows Oaks Saturday and on Double Quick in the El Camino Real 
Derby Sunday. Last month, under similar circumstances, Solis rode Stocks Up to 
victory in the Hollywood Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, who won last year's El Camino Real, is now in the hands of trainer 
Charlie Whittingham. Jerry Moss, who owns Ruhlmann, has transferred most of his 
horses from Bobby Frankel to other trainers. Frankel gave no explanation for 
losing the horses. On the incoming side of the ledger, Frankel is now training 
Saratoga Passage, who as a 2-year-old won the Norfolk in 1987 and then 
developed physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was out of action for a few months last year with a broken wrist, 
Fernando Valenzuela, California's top apprentice, will be able to ride with a 
5-pound allowance through April 21. . . . The decision isn't due until 
February, but the Del Mar Turf Club is expected to receive a 20-year renewal, 
over 2 competing bids, to run racing at the Del Mar track. . . . In total votes 
for the Eclipse Award, Jose Santos received 105 to Chris McCarron's 88 1/2, 
with 25 1/2 votes going to other jockeys. In the total that counted, Santos was 
favored by 2 of the 3 voting groups, with the Daily Racing Racing Form giving 
him the biggest edge over McCarron, 42-27. Turf reporters and track racing 
secretaries also voted.
