</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Jersey might be first in tomatoes, gangland burials and beauty pageants, 
but the state has never been known for the horses it has bred. 
</P>
<P>
Regret, a bona fide Jersey-bred, became the first filly to win the Kentucky 
Derby, but that was in 1915 and not many New Jersey-breds have distinguished 
themselves since then. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, there's Open Mind, another 3-year-old filly who, after not 
getting the chance to run in the Derby, has forged a record quite similar to 
Regret's. Elected to the Hall of Fame here in 1957, Regret had a career that 
included nine wins and one second-place finish in 11 starts. Open Mind takes a 
13-race record of 11 wins and two seconds, including nine straight victories, 
into today's 109th running of the Alabama Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, seven other fillies have entered the 1 1/4-mile Alabama, 
including Lea Lucinda, a stablemate of Open Mind's. It was another stablemate, 
Some Romance, who was the last horse to beat Open Mind, by a nose in the 
Frizette at Belmont Park 10 months ago. Open Mind's other loss, by 4 1/2 
lengths, came a month before the Frizette when she finished second to Ms. Gold 
Pole in the Lassie at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Open Mind will be coupled in the betting with Lea Lucinda, because they 
both race for trainer Wayne Lukas. The ownership is different, Open Mind 
belonging to Gene Klein and Lea Lucinda being the property of Calumet Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama draw gave the rail to Dearly Loved, with Jean Cruguet in the 
saddle. Outside them, in order, come Rose Park with Raul Rojas; Naskra's 
Return, Jose Santos; Open Mind, Angel Cordero; Lea Lucinda, Randy Romero; 
Silent Classic, Eddie Maple; Nite of Fun, Chris Antley, and Dream Deal, Craig 
Perret. As though Open Mind needs another advantage, she will carry 121 pounds, 
the same as the others. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind was bred in New Jersey by Robert Brennan, through the mating of 
Deputy Minister and Stage Luck, a Stage Door Johnny mare who was a minor stakes 
winner and who produced one previous stakes winner. Deputy Minister, a grandson 
of Northern Dancer, won the Eclipse Award as best 2-year-old colt in 1981, then 
had his career ended by injury before he could run in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Klein, Lukas bought Open Mind as a yearling for $150,000. A 
victory today would increase the filly's earnings to almost $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea she was a Jersey-bred when I bid on her," Lukas said. "The 
important thing was that she looked like a race horse. Her name came from the 
fact that I went into the sale with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who became the third man to win the Derby with a filly, with Winning 
Colors in 1988, also had an open mind about this year's Derby. But Lukas 
dissuaded him from running Open Mind, and instead she was an easy winner of the 
Kentucky Oaks, which is run for 3-year-old fillies the day before the Derby. 
Partly because of her small size, Lukas didn't feel that Open Mind had a good 
chance against Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, who ran 1-2 in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind's career actually began against colts, and in New Jersey, where she 
won a couple of races at Monmouth Park. After the two defeats, she began the 
current winning streak with a 1 3/4-length victory in the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs and then, in case the voters had doubts, 
she clinched the 2-year-old filly title with a victory two weeks later in the 
Demoiselle at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind won the Demoiselle by a neck. She usually wins more comfortably than 
that, although in her last start, the Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont, 
she needed intervention from the stewards to beat Nite of Fun, who finished 
first by a nose after clobbering Lukas' filly in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
That victory made Open Mind the seventh filly to sweep the Acorn, the Mother 
Goose and the Coaching Club. Open Mind's people make no apologies and don't 
feel that she backed into the honor. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost three lengths on the interference and only got beat six inches," says 
Jeff Lukas, who handles the Saratoga operation for his father. "She was going 
to win if she didn't have to alter course." 
</P>
<P>
Nite of Fun was soundly beaten by Open Mind in the Mother Goose and the Acorn, 
finishing 28 1/2 lengths behind Lukas' filly, but trainer Jimmy Toner is back 
for more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my filly would have finished first in the Oaks if there had been no 
bumping in the stretch," Toner said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides winning, Open Mind has handled all kinds of courses. She has won three 
times at Belmont, twice each at Monmouth, Gulfstream Park and Churchill Downs 
and once at Aqueduct and Laurel. She has won over mud and before large crowds 
-- more than 65,000 saw both the Kentucky Oaks and the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
And now she has a chance to add Saratoga to the list. It's the same track where 
that other classy Jersey-bred, Regret, suffered one of her two career defeats. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel Cordero is shooting for his second straight victory in the Alabama. He 
won with Maplejinsky last year. . . . Calumet won the Alabama with Our Mims in 
1977 and she was later voted best 3-year-old filly. . . . Wayne Lukas won the 
1984 Alabama with Life's Magic. . . . Dream Deal comes into the Alabama after 
winning the Monmouth Oaks, the stake in which Naskra's Return ran fourth and 
Lea Lucinda was seventh. . . . Shy Tom probably will join Clever Trevor and Le 
Voyageur in facing Easy Goer next Saturday in the $1-million Travers. . . . 
Shuvee and Mom's Command are the only horses to win both the New York triple 
for fillies and the Alabama. . . . Adjudicating, a 2-year-old son of Danzig who 
is undefeated in two New York races, makes his stakes debut for trainer Shug 
McGaughey in the $200,000 Sapling at Monmouth Park today. With Cordero riding 
Open Mind, Randy Romero takes over the mount. Julie Krone, the leading jockey 
at Monmouth, will be riding Carson City for Lukas. On Thursday, Krone won her 
first stake at Saratoga, the Yaddo with Sweet Blow Pop.
