A SILVER ENDING IS EXPECTED TODAY

<P>
Several weeks ago, it was predicted in this space that California was primed to 
have its fifth consecutive Kentucky Derby winner, and that Silver Ending was 
the leading candidate to follow the lead of Ferdinand, Alysheba, Winning Colors 
and Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Derby Day No. 116 has arrived, and there's no reason to make any changes. 
</P>
<P>
A surprising 12-1 on Mike Battaglia's morning line -- the Churchill Downs track 
announcer's Eastern bias appears to be showing again -- Silver Ending deserves 
to be no worse than third choice behind Summer Squall and Mister Frisky. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of four of his eight starts, the Silver Hawk colt's lone poor 
performance came in the San Felipe Handicap on March 18. Hindered by a Santa 
Anita track on which passing was impossible all afternoon, he finished ninth, 
beaten by 15 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the race seemed to be a fluke, easily dismissed. Everything that 
has happened since then gives credence to this line of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
In his next start, the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park, Silver Ending sat well 
off the fast pace, slipped through along the rail, then drew away to win by a 
bit more than three lengths in a quick 1:48 over a track labeled as good. 
</P>
<P>
Since the April 21 victory, trainer Ron McAnally's sophomore has worked well in 
Louisville -- he went six furlongs in 1:13 last Sunday -- and his 
come-from-behind style should play well in a Derby where the early pace figures 
to be fast. 
</P>
<P>
The way he finished at Oaklawn and in his earlier victories suggests that 1 1/4 
miles won't bother him. Neither should an off track, which is considered a 
possibility, or the move to Chris McCarron, who is no stranger to Derby 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending's regular rider, Gary Stevens, is otherwise engaged today. He 
will be aboard Mister Frisky, who hasn't made any mistakes in Puerto Rico or 
California and will try to stay perfect in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
After perfect races in all three of his victories at Santa Anita, the son of 
Marsayas figures to be well placed once more in his bid to go 17-0. With his 
tactical speed, Mister Frisky is able to get position, and no jockey in the 
country is riding better than Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The nagging doubt about the pride of Puerto Rico is the distance. Even though 
he drew away in the Santa Anita Derby, Mister Frisky didn't exactly finish with 
a flourish. Still, it's hard to be too critical of a horse that is unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall is the 7-5 choice on Battaglia's line. His connections should 
hope the Storm Bird colt isn't favored at post time. Not since Spectacular 
Bid's race in 1979 has the favorite won the Derby, and several of them were 
embarrassed. Proud Appeal, the more highly regarded half of an entry, finished 
18th in 1981; Snow Chief was 11th in 1986, and Demon's Begone was pulled up 
when he bled a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Rain would be a help to Summer Squall, who won the Jim Beam and the Blue Grass 
Stakes in the mud. He is unbeaten in four starts on off tracks and is two for 
two at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
On a fast track, his chances would diminish, mainly because he seems suspect at 
1 1/4 miles. Also, he will be ridden by Pat Day, who hasn't exactly overwhelmed 
anyone with his efforts in the Derby and several other big races. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wayne Lukas will have three starters, Land Rush is his lone hope for a 
second Derby victory. The Nijinsky II colt appears to be coming up to his best 
race and finally figures to get the kind of fractions in front of him that he 
needs. Land Rush had two fast workouts over the track and will benefit from the 
distance. Real Cash and Power Lunch are the other Lukas entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Like Silver Ending, Pleasant Tap bounced back from a dull San Felipe showing to 
run second in the Blue Grass, but he doesn't seem quite up to this challenge. 
Thirty Six Red won the Wood Memorial and the Gotham Stakes in New York, but 
that parlay doesn't mean much anymore in terms of Triple Crown success. 
Unbridled's main claim to fame was a victory over a weak Florida Derby field. 
The others don't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Touch, who could have been voted the unluckiest horse of the recent Santa 
Anita meeting, will seek her first victory in the United States Sunday in the 
$100,000 Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Beaten a nose by Brown Bess in the Santa Barbara Handicap after a head loss to 
Annoconnor in the Santa Ana, Royal Touch worked a half-mile in :47 2/5 on the 
turf Thursday morning. Charlie Whittingham's mare is the 121-pound highweight 
and will again be ridden by Russell Baze. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field include Life at the Top, White Mischief II, Reluctant 
Guest, Stylish Star, Beautiful Melody and the entry of Estrella Fuega and Mamma 
Rosita. 
</P>
<P>
Successful in three of eight starts in England, Life at the Top dominated an 
allowance field on April 19 at Santa Anita. Trained by Neil Drysdale, she will 
be getting five pounds from Royal Touch, and Eddie Delahoussaye will be in the 
saddle. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant Guest won the Senorita over this course last spring, Beautiful Melody 
is unbeaten in two starts on the grass and Stylish Star has also shown a 
fondness for the Inglewood grass. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect will be heavily favored to win the $110,200 Triple Bend 
Handicap today, one of two feature attractions on Hollywood Park's Kentucky 
Derby Day program. 
</P>
<P>
John Sadler will also send out Frost Free in the seven-furlong Triple Bend. 
Others in the field are Hot Operator, Twombly, Over the Pole, Joe Nasr, 
Prospectors Gamble, Timeless Answer and Raise a Stanza. 
</P>
<P>
Somethingdifferent and Warcraft top the field in the $111,050 Spotlight 
Breeders' Cup Handicap, which will be run as the sixth race at a mile on the 
turf. A 3-year-old son of Green Forest, Somethingdifferent is perfect in two 
U.S. turf appearances and has been worse than second only once in 10 races. 
Baze will ride for Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft will be making his turf debut for Whittingham after finishing third 
behind Mister Frisky and Video Ranger in the Santa Anita Derby. Robbie Davis 
has the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, who was so impressive while breaking his maiden the first 
time out for trainer Charlie Whittingham, will try racing against winners, 
around two turns and on the turf in today's ninth race. The Deputy Minister 
colt beat maidens by eight lengths on April 21 at Santa Anita, covering six 
furlongs in 1:09 2/5. . . . Because of the Kentucky Derby, there will be no 
early-bird wagering at Hollywood Park. . . . Robbie Davis won three races 
Friday, and Julio Garcia swept the double with longshots Hand's Secret ($19) 
and Miss Freezing ($21.80), then won the ninth race with Timeless Juan at 
$13.40.
