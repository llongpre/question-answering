<P>
The day Summer Squall won the Preakness at Pimlico, the 3-year-old colt was 
injected with 10 cubic centimeters of Lasix, twice the legal dosage that horses 
with pulmonary bleeding can receive on race day in California and most other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is one of eight states that do not limit the amount of Lasix horses 
who have suffered from respiratory bleeding can be given. Three other states 
have a limit higher than five cubic centimeters, the amount recommended by 
Racing Commissioners International, a group of state racing officials from the 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of 32 American racing jurisdictions, including California, adhere to 
the five-cubic-centimeter limit on Lasix, a diuretic that is used to treat 
horses who bleed from the lungs because of exercise-induced stress. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in dosage are merely a small part of the Lasix issue. New York 
doesn't allow horses to race on the drug, or any other, for that matter, while 
the rest of the country does. 
</P>
<P>
The Lasix issue has clouded the 122nd running of the Belmont Stakes Saturday. 
The handicappers' problem is what to do with Unbridled. The Kentucky Derby 
winner and second-place finisher in the Preakness will be heavily favored in 
the final Triple Crown race, even though he won't run on Lasix for the first 
time since he hemorrhaged after a race late last year at Calder in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on Lasix is keeping Summer Squall out of the Belmont, depriving New 
York racing fans of a showdown between the colts who won the first two races in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
To the credit of the managers of Unbridled and Summer Squall, they announced 
their Belmont plans before the Preakness was run and have honored them. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's owners -- a 28-member syndicate that is run by Cot Campbell of 
Dogwood Stable -- are passing up the chance to win a first-place purse of more 
than $400,000, plus a $1-million bonus that goes to the horse who runs in all 
three Triple Crown races and accumulates the most points on a 5-3-1 basis for 
finishing first, second or third. Summer Squall is tied at eight points with 
Unbridled, who needs only to finish the Belmont to win the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say this year's Belmont evokes memories of macabre interest, of 
Demons Begone, the 1987 Kentucky Derby favorite who bled profusely from the 
nostrils after the first half-mile of that race and was unable to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled apparently has not bled since the Calder incident. Summer Squall, on 
the other hand, has bled after at least three morning exercises this year, most 
recently the day before the Preakness, when he showed a trickle of blood from 
the nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of what happened the day before the race, the reputation of all of 
racing was on the line in the Preakness," said trainer Wayne Lukas, who 
believes that Lasix serves a purpose in treating horses. "If Summer Squall had 
bled in the race and run badly, the whole industry would have been put in the 
position of trying to defend what we do to our horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the same in the Belmont. Apparently Unbridled's condition 
has been under control since he was a 2-year-old and his trainer (Carl Nafzger) 
will be trying through natural means to make sure he doesn't bleed on 
Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger is going to dehydrate Unbridled, gradually taking food and water away 
from the horse in the 24 hours before the race. Unbridled will also ingest a 
potassium powder, which is intended to keep his muscle tone high. 
</P>
<P>
"Lasix would be easier, of course," Nafzger said. "The horse has actually 
gained weight since he ran in the Derby. If he didn't, I would think twice 
about running the Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
Will the dehydration work, keeping Unbridled from bleeding but not weakening 
him enough to hurt his chances? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is 100% in this world," Nafzger said. "I've done this with horses 
before, and had some of them run good, and some of them not run one more step." 
</P>
<P>
Some trainers doubt Nafzger's plan will work. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any success trying to do what Nafzger's doing," said Nick Zito, 
trainer who conditions Belmont entrant Thirty Six Red. "I've played sports, and 
horses aren't any different than human athletes. When you play sports, your 
system needs water." 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, who was trying to sweep the Triple Crown in 1987, and Tank's 
Prospect, who won the Preakness in 1985, are two Lasix horses who ran poorly in 
the Belmont, although neither bled. Alysheba was the victim of a tentative ride 
by Chris McCarron, and Tank's Prospect, who had respiratory problems rather 
than being a bleeder, went lame. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas often will ship his bleeders out of New York, many of them coming to 
California where they can be treated with Lasix. With rich owners and hundreds 
of horses in his far-flung operation, Lukas can do what isn't economically 
feasible for other trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, Lukas will run a bleeder in New York without Lasix and 
take his chances. Last month, for instance, Lukas ran Criminal Type, who ran on 
Lasix while winning the Pimlico Special two weeks earlier, in the Metropolitan 
Handicap at Belmont. Criminal Type upset co-favorites Easy Goer and 
Housebuster. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of bleeders from other states is not identified, either in the 
track programs or in the Daily Racing Form, when the horses run in New York. 
Unbridled's condition will be familiar to most horseplayers Saturday, but what 
about horses running in minor races, or the dozens of horses who will run in 
the seven Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park in October? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, the New York racing Establishment remains 
intransigent. Its position on Lasix was fortified by a recent University of 
Pennsylvania study, commissioned by the New York Jockey Club, which showed that 
the diuretic doesn't necessarily stop bleeding, but sometimes improves the 
speed of horses. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the study was predictable. Horsemen in favor of Lasix said that the 
sample of horses was small and that they all ran at a track, Philadelphia Park, 
that generally runs cheap horses. 
</P>
<P>
"The study has scientific credibility," said Tony Chamblin, executive vice 
president of Racing Commissioners International. "But I think the jury is still 
out on the results, because only 79 horses were used and that makes the study 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised, though, that Lasix was found not to stop bleeding in 52% of 
the horses used. But there's something wrong about the number of horses that 
are running on Lasix in this country. The number is about 70%. I find that to 
be absurd, or, at the very least, bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Chamblin doesn't believe racing will ever be unified on the Lasix issue, mainly 
because of the economic needs of tracks caught up in year-round racing 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Tanenbaum, an official at Gulfstream Park: "If Lasix were banned, the 
big tracks would survive, the middle-of-the-road tracks would struggle because 
of a lack of horses, and the little tracks would go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
R. Richards Rolapp, president of the American Horse Council, is still hoping 
for uniformity on the Lasix question. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Jockey Club survey has been constructive," Rolapp told the Daily 
Racing Form this week. "I think we can get there (uniformity). 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in racing believe it's impossible, that the states are going 
to go their own way, but I think that if you could come up with the facts and 
relate them to what is reasonable and enforceable policy, you can have a 
regulatory scheme that is uniform and that everyone can live with. A lot of the 
publicity we have witnessed recently is unfortunate. We need to get 'drugs in 
race horses' out of the news. It can be done." 
</P>
<P>
In California, there is such a strong lobby by the horsemen that it doesn't 
seem likely that Lasix will ever be abandoned. One of these horsemen is Bill 
Shoemaker, who rode five Belmont winners and a record 8,833 winners before he 
retired to take up training early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When they say Lasix 'moves up' horses, I think this is deceptive," Shoemaker 
said. "It's not like it's a hop or something. If you've got a bleeder, Lasix 
makes him more comfortable to run. That's the way it might move him up." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jock Jocoy, the state veterinarian at Del Mar, Lasix was 
introduced to California racing in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"(Trainer) Arnold Winick brought it here from Florida," Jocoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bleeders had been treated in a variety of ways before then, but Winick thought 
Lasix was even better. It made horses feel good, and it made dull horses run 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Other trainers started using Lasix, and finally the state legalized it, even 
though some veterinarians cautioned that the medication was capable of masking 
illegal drugs in postrace testing. "Lasix has a place, it's just another tool a 
trainer will use," Jocoy said. "But like with anything else, trainers can also 
manipulate horses by using it and then not using it on them." 
</P>
<P>
Jocoy estimates that $2 million a year is spent treating bleeders at Santa 
Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar. A five-cc injection of Lasix can cost $20 to 
$35, depending on the veterinarian, and the going rate is $75 for an internal 
endoscopy of a horse to check for bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
For the Preakness, not only did Summer Squall receive a dosage of Lasix that 
was twice the size of the legal limit in California, but he also received two 
injections, one in a vein and the other in a muscle. It is illegal for a 
veterinarian to give a horse Lasix in the muscle in California. 
</P>
<P>
"When a horse gets Lasix intravenously, it really smacks home," Jocoy said. "A 
shot to the muscle is like a reservoir -- it's used as insurance. It dribbles 
into the system, instead of going straight in. The problem with this type of 
injection is that it would affect the testing of a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Cot Campbell made the unintentional pun of the year shortly after Summer Squall 
won the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to bleed a little bit to win a race like this," Campbell said, and 
then caught himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Not literally," Campbell said. "What I meant to say is that you've got to 
sweat a little bit to win a race like this."
