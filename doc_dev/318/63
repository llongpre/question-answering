The last time Ron McAnally did any running in these parts, he was trying to 
escape from the orphanage where he had been dropped off when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the young McAnally attempted to run away from the Covington Protestant 
Children's Home. Once, he changed his mind and went back. The other time, he 
was picked up in downtown Covington and returned to the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy getting out, either," McAnally remembered Thursday. "I had to 
cross a slate roof, and there was a two-story drop to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, 57, will do some more "running" in Northern Kentucky Saturday. Tight 
Spot, one of his candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby, is the 5-1 third 
choice, behind favorites Summer Squall and Bright Again, in the $500,000 Jim 
Beam Stakes at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally was born in Covington, not far from the old Latonia Race Course and 
only a 10-minute drive from Turfway. His mother died of tuberculosis when he 
was 5. His father, who had four other young children, worked as a dispatcher 
for a cab company in Cincinnati and couldn't handle the family. The five 
children were sent to the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally spent 12 years there. His memories of the place are generally good, 
but one of his early jobs was enough to send him over the wall twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the dishwasher," he said. "It was just me and one other guy. We had to 
wash the dishes for everybody -- 200 kids -- three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally smiled and said: "You know, I'm still washing them." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Debbie, is in Europe, visiting one of their daughters who is studying 
on a college exchange program. Debbie is a 50% owner of Silver Ending, another 
Derby hopeful who may run in the Blue Grass Stakes on April 14 at Keeneland in 
Lexington, Ky., 75 miles south of here. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally didn't have to wash dishes Thursday night. He and his two sisters, who 
are married to business executives in this area, went out to dinner. McAnally's 
brothers live in Southern California, one working for the Horsemen's Benevolent 
and Protective Assn. and the other running a restaurant near Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the perfect way to grow up," McAnally said of the orphanage. "But 
at least we had the advantage of being family and all being in there together. 
You hear about families where the kids are fighting all the time, even when 
they grow up. We're so close that I can't imagine any of us ever having a 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally's father was in his 40s when he died of a heart attack. Joe, one of 
Ron's brothers, was the only child who lived with the father after leaving the 
orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has become a successful California trainer and is eligible for 
election to horse racing's Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., this year, 
but he is mindful of his roots. He wrote a check just the other day for the 
orphanage where he grew up. And today, while visiting Keeneland, he'll look in 
on John Henry, who at 15 is a leading attraction at the Kentucky Horse Park. 
With McAnally as trainer, John Henry won horse-of-the-year titles in 1981 and 
'84, and the grass-loving gelding was instrumental in McAnally being voted 
trainer of the year in 1981. John Henry is also on the Hall of Fame ballot this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has a picture at home in Pasadena of him and his grandfather, who 
introduced him to racing at Gulfstream Park in Florida when he was about 6. 
</P>
<P>
After an Air Force hitch, McAnally tried studying engineering at the University 
of Cincinnati, but admits that he wasn't much of a student. He wound up living 
in the San Fernando Valley with an uncle, trainer Reggie Cornell. McAnally 
started as a chauffeur for Cornell, who quit driving after his brother was 
seriously injured in an auto accident in Canada. But McAnally wound up breaking 
Silky Sullivan, the charismatic, Cornell-trained Santa Anita Derby winner who 
bombed out, at 2-1, in the 1958 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has started four horses in the Kentucky Derby, finishing fourth with 
Super Moment in 1980, fourth with Water Bank and 13th with Cassaleria in 1982 
and fifth with Hawkster last year. 
</P>
<P>
The best young horse McAnally has ever trained, however, was Donut King. He 
bought him for $16,000 at a Del Mar yearling sale for Verne Winchell, the 
doughnut man. As a 2-year-old, Donut King won the Champagne Stakes at Aqueduct, 
beating the intrepid Jaipur and Crimson Satan, who was voted the division 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Donut King probably should have won the Wood Memorial, his 
final prep for the Derby. McAnally told his jockey, Manny Ycaza, that Sunrise 
County, the Wood favorite, had a terrible habit of lugging out in the stretch. 
Ycaza waited as long as he could before trying to pass Sunrise County, but 
Donut King still got caught in the drift and finished third, beaten by less 
than a length. Sunrise County was disqualified from first to third, and the 
victory went to Admiral's Voyage, who had finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Full of confidence, McAnally sent Donut King to Churchill Downs. The Monday 
before the Derby, after working the race distance of 1 1/4 miles, Donut King 
came back lame and his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
Now McAnally is at Turfway Park for the first time, chasing another Derby with 
another Verne Winchell horse, Tight Spot. When the trainer got here, memories 
of that Northern Kentucky orphanage and Donut King's Derby miss were almost 
bound to cross at that intersection of the mind. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, the 8-5 favorite in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Beam Stakes, drew the No. 
1 post position, which is no longer considered a disadvantage at Turfway Park. 
. . . Pat Day, who has won with all three of his previous Jim Beam mounts, will 
ride Summer Squall. Outside them, in order, will be Sluki, Bright Again, 
Yonder, Seven Spades, Power Lunch, Top Snob, Fighting Fantasy, Private School 
and Tight Spot. . . . Corey Black will ride Tight Spot, and Alex Solis is in 
from Santa Anita to ride Power Lunch, the Wayne Lukas trainee who broke his 
maiden on March 8 at Oaklawn Park. . . . With rain forecast for today and 
Saturday, there's a chance of an off track. 
</P>
<P>
Three 3-year-olds who ran earlier in California -- Tarascon, Individualist I 
and Hawaiian Pass -- are entered in Saturday's Rebel, a 1 1/16-mile race at 
Oaklawn Park. Tarascon is the 2-1 favorite in an 11-horse field. . . . Smelly, 
a prominent 3-year-old, will face nine opponents Saturday at Garden State Park 
in the Cherry Hill Mile. . . . Brown Bess heads the five-horse field Saturday 
at Santa Anita in the $200,000 Santa Barbara Handicap, a 1 1/4-mile grass race 
for fillies and mares. Also running are Royal Touch, Estrella Fuega, Double 
Wedge and Isabella Ra.
