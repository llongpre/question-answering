   Sunday Silence, the Kentucky Derby winner, won
a photo-finish duel with Easy Goer by a nose on Saturday to win the
$674,200 Preakness at Pimlico and a chance at horse racing's first
Triple Crown since 1978.
   No horse has won the Derby, Preakness and the Belmont Stakes
since Affirmed won all three races in 1978.
   Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the beaten favorite in the
Kentucky Derby and the favorite again Saturday, ran
eyeball-to-eyeball in the stretch as the crowd screamed itself
hoarse. At the wire, Sunday Silence won by a nose.
   Before the victory became official, the stewards deliberated a
foul claim filed against Sunday Silence and jockey Pat Valenzuela
by Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer.
   Easy Goer finished five lengths in front of Rock Point, who was
two lengths ahead of Dansil. Completing the order of finish were
Hawkster, Houston, Pulverizing and Northern Wolf.
   Sunday Silence carried 126 pounds over the 1 3-16 miles in 1:53
4-5, the third fastest time of the 114 Preaknesses.
   The winner paid $6.20, $3 and $3.20, unbeaten in four starts as
a 3-year-old. His next race will be the 1{-mile Belmont Stakes June
10 at Belmont Park. Easy Goer paid $2.40 and $2.40 while Rock Point
was $3.60 to show.
