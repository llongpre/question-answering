Easy Goer was transported 200 miles from Pimlico to Belmont Park on Sunday, 
which means that he beat Sunday Silence to the site of the final Triple Crown 
race by a day. 
</P>
<P>
It's the only time Easy Goer has beaten Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Although heavily favored in two previous Triple Crown races, Easy Goer finished 
second to Sunday Silence each time. He was 2 1/2 lengths behind in the Kentucky 
Derby, and on Saturday at Pimlico, he was nosed out of a victory in what may go 
down as the most rousing Preakness of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer will meet again in the 121st Belmont Stakes on 
June 10. Sunday Silence can become the 12th 3-year-old -- and the first since 
another California-trained colt, Affirmed, in 1978 -- to sweep the Triple 
Crown. Because of a sponsorship by an automobile company, a Triple Crown title 
is worth $5 million, which includes the first-place purse money from all three 
races. Should Sunday Silence not win the Belmont but finish second or third, he 
would still win a $1-million bonus; Easy Goer could win the $1 million by 
winning the Belmont and if Sunday Silence finishes fourth or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, trainer of Hawkster, a horse who has been unable to beat Sunday 
Silence in the Santa Anita Derby, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, doesn't 
need the Belmont to know which horse is best. Hawkster has been fourth, fifth 
and fifth in those three races. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence missed two days of training (because of a sore foot) and still 
won the Preakness," McAnally said. "There's no question that he's the best 
horse. Because of that, he was about two lengths rather than a nose better than 
Easy Goer on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's trainer, Shug McGaughey, thought that his colt's dull race in the 
Kentucky Derby was because of the muddy track at Churchill Downs. But there 
were no excuses in the 114th Preakness, unless you count the foul claim by 
jockey Pat Day, who thought that Sunday Silence squeezed his mount enough in 
the furious stretch run to be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy Goer fouled Patrick (Valenzuela, Sunday Silence's jockey) a heck of a lot 
more than he was fouled by us," trainer Charlie Whittingham said Sunday 
morning. "The other horse had his head turned in my horse's direction and Day 
was whipping him left-handed on the rail, which made his horse come out some." 
</P>
<P>
The stewards took eight minutes -- a little longer than usual -- to review the 
race before they officiated Sunday Silence's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said Sunday Silence will be shipped to Belmont Park today and be 
placed in trainer Dick Lundy's barn. Lundy worked as an assistant to 
Whittingham in California for six years before he formed his own stable. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 1/2 miles, the Belmont is the longest of the three Triple Crown races. The 
Derby is 1 1/4 miles and the Preakness is 1 3/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Whittingham nor Day believe their horses will have trouble running the 
Belmont distance. Although Belmont Park issued a list of eight non-Preakness 
horses that are possibilities for the race, it remains to be seen how many will 
actually run. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we missed two days last week because of the foot, I wasn't worried 
that Sunday Silence would be fit for the Preakness," Whittingham said. "He was 
plenty fit for the Derby two weeks before and had that under him. On Saturday, 
he was ready to run half-way to California without using the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey thought that Day moved to the lead too early -- Easy Goer took over 
heading into the far turn -- but said that no jockey change is planned for the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with what Pat said," McGaughey said. "If he didn't move early, he 
would have been parked outside the rest of the way. And if he had waited and we 
still lost by a nose, everybody would have said that he moved too late." 
</P>
<P>
Pimlico's record crowd of 90,145 made Easy Goer the 3-5 favorite and sent 
Sunday Silence off at 2-1. In the Kentucky Derby, Sunday Silence was 3-1 and 
Easy Goer, coupled with stablemate Awe Inspiring, was 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's betting didn't surprise Whittingham, but it did amuse him. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Easy Goer's supporters) don't die very easy," he said. "It's the 
press that makes the odds, and sometimes they get people thinking poorly." 
</P>
<P>
In talking about Sunday Silence's second career defeat, which preceded his 
current five-race winning streak, Whittingham mentioned Houston, the horse that 
beat him in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance at Hollywood Park last December. This 
year, Houston has finished fifth in the Santa Anita Derby, eighth in the 
Kentucky Derby and sixth in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"Houston got good press early," Whittingham said. "But the race he beat us at 
Hollywood still told me that I had a very good horse. My horse had just broken 
his maiden a couple of weeks before, and against Houston he put away three 
horses early before they hooked up in the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost to Houston by a head, has developed into possibly the 
best horse Whittingham, 76, has ever had. Whittingham has won more than 500 
stakes races, which is a record, and has trained eight horses that have won 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Sunday Silence could be the best," Whittingham said. "For sure, 
he's the only one who's given me both a Derby and a Preakness." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham won his first Derby in 1986 with Ferdinand. Their Triple Crown 
aspirations ended quickly, however, when Ferdinand was second, four lengths 
behind Snow Chief, in the Preakness, and then Ferdinand ran third in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Whittingham and Sunday Silence are only 1 1/2 miles away. Easy Goer has 
the early lead, but only because he shipped out of here Sunday.
