Trainer Charlie Whittingham leads Sunday Silence back to the races today in the 
$1-million Super Derby, intent on ending Easy Goer's unopposed dash to the 
horse-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
"The only chance we have to get horse of the year would be win this race and 
the Breeders' Cup," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost two straight after beating Easy Goer in the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness, is expected to be an odds-on favorite in the field of 
eight for the Super Derby over 1 1/4 miles at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, 
La. 
</P>
<P>
The second favorite is expected to be another Phipps colt, Awe Inspiring. Also 
in the field will be Le Voyageur, Big Earl, Dale's Shotgun, Bruho and Harmony 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, winner of 10 consecutive stakes for 3-year-olds, will race against 
older horses for the first time in the Ruffian Handicap over 1 1/8 miles today 
at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The field of six will include two 5-year-old mares, Bayakoa and Miss Brio. 
Bayakoa has won four Grade I stakes this year; Miss Brio won the Maskette on 
Sept. 9 at Belmont and has beaten Bayakoa twice. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Yankee Affair swung wide to gain the lead after entering the stretch 
and won the $470,400 Man O'War Stakes for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont. Yankee 
Affair returned $8.20, $4.60 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
One Drink came from far back and then drew away to win the $53,300 Derby Trial 
Stakes for 3-olds by 3 3/4 lengths at Fairplex Park in Pomona. One Drink 
covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43. 
</P>
