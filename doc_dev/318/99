When it comes to the race track, it helps to have a genuine Renaissance 
wrangler, such as Otto Draper, on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Otto knows race riding. He was a jockey on the Northwest and mid-Atlantic 
circuits for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otto knows training. His barn was up to as many as 20 head during the mid-1980s 
before financial setbacks turned business sour. 
</P>
<P>
Otto even knows painting. After nearly 20 years of brush work and sketches, 
Draper has begun to sell some of his equine oils and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, Otto knows Warcraft, the 3-year-old colt from Charlie 
Whittingham's stable who has been Draper's morning exercise partner since last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft will be among the contenders in the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby on 
Saturday, and a solid performance by the son of Ack Ack could buy him -- and 
Draper -- a ticket to the Kentucky Derby on May 5 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Draper already knows what it takes to win the Derby, either the Santa Anita or 
Kentucky version. While working for Wayne Lukas, Draper was the regular 
exercise rider for Winning Colors in 1988, when she swept both races and became 
a national darling. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas Winning Colors was a tightly-wound bundle of muscle and nerves, 
Warcraft is an easygoing colt who doesn't know enough yet to get all excited. 
</P>
<P>
Draper describes Warcraft as a baby-faced kid with a mouth as soft as expensive 
glove leather. Exercise riders like that quality in a horse, for the softer the 
mouth, the more responsive the animal is to pressure on the reins and bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He impressed me the very first time I worked him," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
That was last Dec. 11 in a five-furlong breeze at Hollywood Park. Warcraft 
worked in company with another promising Whittingham colt, Far Out Star, who 
ran second in his debut last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Luis (Jauregui) was on Far Out Star," Draper recalled. "We were going along 
head and head. I looked over and smiled at him, then loosened the reins just a 
little bit. Warcraft immediately started to pull away." 
</P>
<P>
Draper quickly throttled down, afraid to tap into Warcraft's true ability too 
soon. Still, it was a memorable moment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're riding a horse in the afternoon who feels like he did, you've got 
the confidence that you could win any race at any time," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anita Derby will be Warcraft's sixth race in 76 days, a strenuous 
schedule by most standards and an apparent departure from Whittingham's slow, 
patient style. But more than anything else, Whittingham is known for tailoring 
a schedule to fit a horse, not the other way around. He says Warcraft can stand 
the gaff. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing you've got to remember, this colt never raced at all last year," 
Whittingham said. "You don't want to push the Ack Acks too early or you'll be 
in trouble later on. And this colt had an awful lot of foundation under him 
before he even got to the races." 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft made his debut on Jan. 21 and finished a so-so fourth, going seven 
furlongs that neither delighted nor disappointed his people. He came back on 
Feb. 4 to break his maiden at 1 1/16 miles, then finished far back going a mile 
on a muddy track on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really his only bad race," Draper said. "And I blame it on the fact 
that he's still immature. He really didn't know how to handle getting hit with 
all that mud. 
</P>
<P>
"To look at him right now, he's still got a little baby face and a real soft, 
quiet eye. Give him a peppermint and he doesn't even know how to eat it yet. He 
kind of sucks on them a little, mouths them and then drops them, like he's 
saying, 'What do I do with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, who is owned by Whittingham in partnership with Mary Bradley and 
Nancy Chandler, bounced back from his mud race and won by six lengths on March 
4. In the San Felipe Handicap on March 18, his stakes debut, he finished second 
to upset winner Real Cash, losing by 5 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"He's maturing fast," Draper added. "We've moved him right along, and he's 
handled everything we've thrown his way without getting all stirred up. 
</P>
<P>
"He just putzes along and does his own thing. He doesn't get up on his hind 
feet and rear like Sunday Silence. He's not a run-off like Winning Colors, and 
he doesn't have a 15-race winning streak like Mister Frisky. He's quiet, and 
some may overlook him because of that. But he has a presence about him." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft had his final Santa Anita Derby prep Wednesday morning, going half a 
mile in :47 before the rains came. Chris McCarron, who rides him Saturday, was 
aboard for the workout. With only $30,000 in graded race earnings, Warcraft 
needs a healthy chunk of the purse Saturday to be assured of a starting berth 
in the Kentucky Derby, which is limited to 20 runners. 
</P>
<P>
Leading rider Gary Stevens returns to Santa Anita today after making a special 
appearance at Longacres Racetrack. Stevens, who wore a leg brace because of 
Perthes' disease when he was a child, made a special appearance at a Seattle 
area children's orthopedic hospital, then rode the opening-day card Wednesday 
where he won the $30,000 feature aboard Hilco's Scamper.
