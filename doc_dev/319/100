Trainer John Sadler was in the Breeders' Cup limelight last year with Olympic 
Prospect, a top contender in the Sprint. The big chestnut gelding ended up 
finishing seventh on a muddy track he did not like, about four lengths behind 
Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the same horse and same trainer are back for a second try, yet 
they have spent most mornings this week in virtual anonymity, stabled in an 
almost empty barn in the far corner of the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind at all," Sadler said Friday. "Last year he deserved the 
attention. This year, let's face it, he's a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope they ignore him for the first eighth of a mile," the trainer 
added. "If they let him go early . . . Well, let's just say there may be a 
pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
With only two starts this year -- one impressive win and one dismal loss -- 
Olympic Prospect presents a difficult handicapping challenge. Sadler, however, 
said the key to his chances may be the lack of racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I might have pushed him a little hard," the trainer said. "He's 
always run best when fresh off a layoff, like right now." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham will get a police escort to and from the race track today. 
Highway patrolman Lester Marder has volunteered his services this week to the 
Sunday Silence camp, and he wants to make sure everything goes smoothly for 
Whittingham on the big day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this on my own time," Marder said as he watched Sunday Silence in 
the paddock Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody bothers these people or gets near the horse, I ask them politely to 
stop. I have to ask a second time, they go for a ride in my car." 
</P>
<P>
For his unusual moonlighting, Marder will be getting a photograph of him 
feeding Sunday Silence a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, just being around this horse is a once-in-a-lifetime thing," Marder 
added. "I haven't been to a Kentucky Derby yet, but spending time with a Derby 
winner is the next best thing." 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer was the early 1-5 favorite for the Classic, and Sunday Silence was 
second choice at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Other early favorites include Caltech in the Turf at 4-1, the entry of Rhythm 
and Adjudicating in the Juvenile at 7-2, Steinlen in the Mile at 2-1, Bayakoa 
in the Distaff at 3-2, Trumpets Blare in the Juvenile Fillies at 2-1 and Mr. 
Nickerson in the Sprint at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Among the obvious early overlays were On the Line, 8-1 in the Sprint; Ile de 
Chypre in the Turf at 22-1, and Present Value at 70-1 in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris McCarron was asked if he had any advice for Kent Desormeaux, the 
Maryland-based rider who has dead aim on McCarron's single-season mark of 546 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I could tell him would be: 'Don't stop,' " McCarron replied. 
"When he hits 546 -- and I'm certain he will -- he should run it up as high as 
he can." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux got his 503rd winner of the year when he rode Nefario Cable, at odds 
of nearly 103-1, to victory Friday at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, was being pumped for the umpteenth time by 
a network television staffer looking for an interview angle. 
</P>
<P>
"What hasn't been touched on that you'd like to tell people about the horse?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I have no idea," McGaughey said. "But for goodness sakes, don't 
ask me 'How's he doing?' And please don't ask what kind of personality he's 
got." 
</P>
<P>
Sabona, one of two horses in the Breeders' Cup Mile for trainer Neil Drysdale, 
will be running for a different owner today. A half interest in the son of 
Exclusive Native was sold this week to William O. Reed of Mare Haven Farm in 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Sabona, a 21-1 shot in early Breeders' Cup betting, will run in the names of 
Sir Ernest Harrison and Mrs. Audrey Reed.
