In 1986, Variety Road beat Ferdinand, who won the Kentucky Derby about two 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at 24-1, Variety Road beat Ferdinand again, as well as Snow Chief and 
Broad Brush, in the San Fernando Handicap at Santa Anita. Ferdinand went on to 
recognition as horse of the year, Broad Brush was voted the second-best 
handicap horse in the country and Snow Chief beat them both in the Strub, three 
weeks after his loss to Variety Road. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand, Snow Chief and Broad Brush have been sent to stud, but their nemesis 
continues to make the most of two careers, as a stallion and a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, now a 6-year-old, serviced a full book of about 40 mares this 
year at Old English Rancho in Ontario, then came back running. Unraced for 7 
1/2 months, Variety Road ran a mile in 1:34 2/5 to set a track record at the 
Sacramento fair in August. Then he won a small stake last Saturday at Bay 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer isn't getting Variety Road ready for a year-end 
matchup with Easy Goer, but those last two races were notable accomplishments 
for a horse who has chronic sore feet and who once had breathing difficulty 
because of partial paralysis on the left side of his face. And Bruce Headley, 
who trained Variety Road when he ran in Southern California, can remember 
missing the 1986 Kentucky Derby because the horse developed boils on his neck 
and almost died after running a 106-degree fever. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has now had 11 victories and nine seconds in 34 races, earning 
about $650,000 for his owner and breeder, Kjell Qvale. It is rare for a horse 
to successfully mix racing and breeding careers, but Qvale, a San Franciscan, 
also alternated Silveyville between the breeding shed and the track and he 
earned more than $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Variety Road came back to me the last part of June," Hollendorfer said from 
Bay Meadows, where the horse is stabled. "I couldn't believe that he was ready 
to run a mile as soon as he was. They jogged him at the farm and that had to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Hollendorfer had never trained a horse that went to stud and then returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might be a problem, but it hasn't been with this horse," he said. 
"He's had his mind on the business of running from the time I got him back. He 
looks exactly the same as he did when he left, and as long as his feet aren't 
bothering him, I think he'll be better than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has shown a liking for grass, and Hollendorfer would like to run 
him in the Tanforan Handicap at Bay Meadows on Oct. 21. Variety Road may find 
the spot familiar. He won the Tanforan last year, which was his last stake win 
until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Tom Meeker, the president of Churchill Downs, told his shareholders 
that the Kentucky Derby track would be the site of the Breeders' Cup again, and 
Wednesday the group that sponsors the seven multimillion-dollar races -- some 
of them Churchill shareholders -- confirmed that the Louisville track is 
getting the event on Nov. 2, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Despite bad weather -- the day was raw and wet and the most important race, the 
$3-million Classic, was won by Alysheba in near darkness -- Churchill Downs 
drew 71,000 for the Breeders' Cup last year. That broke the record of 69,000 
set at Santa Anita in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the first four Breeders' Cups were held in California, to the dismay 
of many Eastern horsemen. Since 1987, the races have stayed in the East, with 
this year's Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park near Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on Nov. 
4 and next year's at Belmont Park in New York. Santa Anita is a strong favorite 
for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill Downs will become the first track other than Hollywood Park to have 
the Breeders' Cup twice. The weather in Kentucky will always be iffy at that 
time of year, but otherwise Churchill Downs is a good place for the races. Its 
dirt and grass surfaces are excellent, Louisville can be easily reached by fans 
and horsemen, and the races don't get swallowed up by other sports that more 
metropolitan areas have. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the people at Churchill Downs are experts at handling big crowds. 
They get plenty of practice, with throngs of more than 100,000 commonplace for 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence must be eager to run. The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, 
who has been second to Easy Goer in the Belmont and second to Prized in the 
Swaps since then, had been working sensationally at Del Mar, and upon his 
arrival at Louisiana Downs for Sunday's Super Derby, he reared in his stall, 
suffering a minor bump on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence will be favored against seven other 3-year-olds in the 1 
1/4-mile, $1-million race Sunday. Awe Inspiring will be trying to give trainer 
Shug McGaughey his second consecutive Super Derby victory and the other 
starters are expected to be Dispersal, Bruho, Le Voyageur, Harmony Creek, Big 
Earl and Dale's Shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey saddled the winning Seeking the Gold last year. Eddie Maple and 
Laffit Pincay, who have divided victories in six of the first nine runnings, 
don't have mounts. Chris McCarron, who won in 1987 with Alysheba, rides Harmony 
Creek, and Jorge Velasquez, winner in 1982 with Reinvested, will be astride 
Dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's owners will have to pay a $120,000 supplementary fee if their 
5-year-old mare is to run against Open Mind, the best filly in the country, in 
the $1-million Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
By running against Open Mind on Sunday, in the 1 1/8-mile Ruffian Handicap at 
Belmont Park, Bayakoa's camp should learn whether the Breeders' Cup supplement 
is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa finished last as the 7-10 favorite in the Chula Vista Handicap at Del 
Mar on Sept. 2. Trainer Ron McAnally thought that the weight -- Bayakoa gave 
seven pounds to the winner, Goodbye Halo -- and a fast early pace contributed 
to his mare's surprisingly poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the weights are concerned, Bayakoa is hardly doing better in the 
Ruffian. She carries high weight of 125 pounds, which is five more than Open 
Mind, who is on a 10-race winning streak. Theoretically, Open Mind was assigned 
126 pounds, but she gets a six-pound break because she's only a 3-year-old. 
Another factor in the Ruffian is Miss Brio, who also carries 120 pounds after 
winning the Maskette Mile in her last start. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Toltackitt, a 2-year-old filly, was the fastest qualifier for Sunday's Pacific 
Coast Breeders Futurity for quarter horses at Fairplex Park in Pomona. A field 
of 10 will run 350 yards for a purse of more than $200,000. . . . The same day, 
Fairplex will take bets on the telecast of the Super Derby. . . . Drouilly won 
the Pomona Handicap in consecutive years, the second time as a 7-year-old in 
1983, and one of his sons, Drouilly's Boy, set the Fairplex track record for 
six furlongs with a time of 1:09 1/5 on Tuesday. . . . Prime Ticket is carrying 
nightly replays of the quarter horse races from Los Alamitos at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens, who suffered a broken wrist and hand at Del Mar, isn't 
planning on missing his third Breeders' Cup, despite the injuries, and says 
that he'll be back riding at Santa Anita in mid-October. . . . Easy Goer is 
likely to use a $1-million race as a prep for a $3-million stake. He's expected 
to run in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, at 1 1/2 miles at Belmont on Oct. 7, and 
then go back to 1 1/4 miles in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who bruised a foot while winning the Haskell at Monmouth Park, 
is expected to run in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. "That's going to be a real 
tough race, but I think he'll be up to it, regardless of whether we get a prep 
race for him or not," trainer Jerry Hollendorfer said. . . . When River 
Memories won the Flower Bowl Handicap at Belmont last Saturday, it was the 
5-year-old mare's first victory since the Rothmans at Woodbine in October of 
1987.
