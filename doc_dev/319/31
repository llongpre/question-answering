FRANCE-BASED TAGEL, NOT HOUSTON, IS REAL DERBY MYSTERY HORSE 
</P>

<P>
Houston has been called the mystery horse, and Santa Anita is billing 
Saturday's Santa Anita Derby as the mystery race, but the real mystery among 
the candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby is a 3-year-old colt who is in 
training more than 4,000 miles away from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel is his name, and although the France-based, Kentucky-bred horse has yet 
to race this year, a consensus of future books in Las Vegas lists him as a 
respectable 12-1 to win the Kentucky Derby, which will be run four weeks from 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The trend this year is for many horses to go into the Derby lightly raced, but 
Tagel's campaign borders on the non-existent. He will run only once, in a mile 
race on the grass at Longchamps in Paris on April 16. If he does well, trainer 
Francois Boutin will wait until the first week of May to ship him to the United 
States, just a few days before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The race later this month will be only Tagel's fourth start but he's already 
familiar with Churchill Downs. Last November, in his only race on dirt, Tagel 
lost for the first time, running third behind Is It True and Easy Goer, in the 
1 1/16-mile Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel broke slowly and was beaten by 9 1/4 lengths, but he still ran better 
than seven other 2-year-olds used to racing on dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Boutin, who has been exposing Tagel to a dirt training track in France, is 
known for shipping horses to America and having them win right off the plane. 
He won the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes twice that way with the brilliant filly 
Miesque and he won the Turf Classic with April Run twice in New York, each time 
just a few weeks after she ran in the Arc de Triomphe at Longchamps. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel's Kentucky Derby prep race is the same one that Blushing John won a year 
ago. Blushing John, owned by Allen Paulson, as is Tagel, won the Razorback 
Handicap at Oaklawn Park last month. 
</P>
<P>
The real mystery in the 52nd Santa Anita Derby is why Mr. Bolg will run and try 
to beat undefeated Houston, Sunday Silence and three other horses -- Hawkster, 
Music Merci and Flying Continental -- who have won stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg has early speed -- he ran a half-mile in 44 seconds at Santa Anita in 
January -- but he has never run beyond seven furlongs and his only two 
victories in eight starts have been in races restricted to California-breds. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg is a son of Bolger, who is a speed sire. His dam, Brew Mistress, won 
at 1 1/4 miles and there are other indications of stamina on the female side of 
Mr. Bolg's bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
"He won that last race (at seven furlongs by five lengths in 1:22 3/5 on March 
10) very impressively," said Yves Seguin, who trains Mr. Bolg. "In the race 
before that (the Bolsa Chica Stakes), he was a close fourth despite a rough 
trip. He has been training specifically for Saturday since his last start." 
</P>
<P>
The longest-priced winner of the Santa Anita Derby was Destroyer, who paid 
$89.80 when he upset Agitate in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Win, the horse who finished second to Zoffany in the Hollywood Turf 
Cup in December 1985? 
</P>
<P>
Tendon problems have kept the 9-year-old gelding away from the races ever 
since, but Win has popped up in the entries at Aqueduct and will run in a 
seven-furlong race there today. 
</P>
<P>
Win actually injured his tendon twice, the second time in a comeback attempt 
nine months after the Hollywood Park race. He underwent surgery last year and 
returned to training in October. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Win would have won the male grass title, but Cozzene won the Breeders' 
Cup Mile at Aqueduct at the end of the year and beat him out in a close vote. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been doing great since the surgery," said Sally Bailie, Win's trainer. 
"We've never looked back." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bramlage, the veterinarian from Ohio State who performed the surgery on 
Win, may want to move on to Kerosene, the highly regarded 3-year-old whose 
racing career was ended by a tendon injury in Florida this week. 
</P>
<P>
Kerosene, who had two wins and two seconds in four starts, would have been one 
of the favorites at Hialeah Saturday in the Flamingo, which, along with the 
Santa Anita Derby, is one of four remaining major preps for the Kentucky Derby. 
The others are the Blue Grass at Keeneland on April 15 and the Wood Memorial at 
Aqueduct on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
With Kerosene out of the Flamingo, the 9-5 favorite in a nine-horse field is 
Awe Inspiring, trained by Shug McGaughey. McGaughey will be at Aqueduct 
Saturday, to saddle Easy Goer, the future-book favorite for the Kentucky Derby, 
in the Gotham Mile. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is a 1-2 favorite in a field of four. Trainer Wayne Lukas, who is 
starting Texian, says openly that he's running for second-place money. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela was examined by a Santa Anita track doctor Monday and 
given permission to resume riding this week by the stewards. Valenzuela, who is 
ranked among the nation's top 10 riders with $1.5 million in purses, rode three 
winners Wednesday his first day back. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, for the second time in recent weeks, Valenzuela canceled his 
mounts because of illness. Laffit Pincay, who replaced him on Ruhlmann, won the 
San Bernardino Handicap. Valenzuela is scheduled to ride Sunday Silence in the 
Santa Anita Derby Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his history of drug problems, any absence by Valenzuela causes 
suspicion. The stewards ordered Valenzuela to be tested for drugs this week. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Joe Manzi, who has taken a course on cardiac-pulmonary resuscitation, 
put it to use last week on Bruce Ferguson, a horse owner who collapsed at Santa 
Anita. Manzi had left the winner's circle after a win by his 3-year-old filly, 
Formidable Lady, and was on his way back to watch a television rerun when he 
noticed a commotion. "The man was gasping for air and his eyes were going back 
in his head," Manzi said. "Everybody was running around and didn't know what to 
do. I kept pressing on his heart and pretty soon he started breathing and his 
color came back. Then they took him on a stretcher to an ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
It was incorrectly written here that Jerry Moss, who owns Ruhlmann, had also 
switched from trainer Bobby Frankel to Charlie Whittingham with the 
stakes-winning Pay the Butler. Pay the Butler isn't owned by Moss, and Frankel 
continues to train the horse. . . . Chris McCarron, back in action after a 
five-day suspension, will ride Pranke in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap April 
23. . . . Walter Guerra, who has been riding for five years in Florida, returns 
to Santa Anita next week. . . . Tenacious Tom, who wasn't nominated for the 
Triple Crown races, is the only 3-year-old colt with two stakes wins at the 
Santa Anita meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers were surprised that John Brunetti, the owner of Hialeah, made a 
strong showing in battling the incumbent Del Mar Thoroughbred Club for the 
20-year renewal to conduct racing at the seaside track. Brunetti received two 
of the six votes from the State Race Track Leasing Commission. Apparently, 
though, the votes were cast by commissioners who were not necessarily in favor 
of Brunetti, but who were generally opposed to the Thoroughbred Club, which has 
operated Del Mar since 1970.
