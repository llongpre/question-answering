<P>
If Houston doesn't redeem himself today, his name could be changed to 
Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
The flop of the Santa Anita Derby is favored in the Kentucky Derby Trial on 
opening day at Churchill Downs, and a win will carry him into the Derby itself 
next Saturday, when Awe Inspiring, Easy Goer's alter ego, is also expected to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Shug McGaughey, who has been reluctant to run Awe Inspiring as an entry 
with Easy Goer, the Wood Memorial winner and Derby favorite, indicated Friday 
that he would start both colts in the 115th running of the Triple Crown race. 
The horses race for the Phipps family, Ogden Phipps owning Easy Goer and his 
son, Dinny, owning Awe Inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey's change of plans makes sense, because Awe Inspiring, a late 
developer, won the Flamingo Stakes, a major Derby prep, at Hialeah in his last 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Under Kentucky rules, the Phipps horses must be coupled for betting purposes in 
the Derby, but if they ran separately, Awe Inspiring would probably be the 
third betting choice, behind Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, the Santa Anita 
Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
Flown here from New York Wednesday, Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring were among the 
first horses on the track Friday morning. They each galloped 1 1/2 miles -- a 
quarter of a mile farther than the Derby distance -- in the eerie predawn 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Van Berg, winner of the 1987 Derby with Alysheba and a trainer without a 
starter in this year's race, was on his stable pony as McGaughey and his wife, 
Mary Jane, who is eight months pregnant, watched from the outside rail on the 
backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Run 'em both," Van Berg said to the trainer's wife. "You might never get 
another chance to run two colts this good in the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Another horseman on the track was trainer Wayne Lukas, despite a painful back 
injury that has prevented him from straightening up for five weeks. Lukas gets 
on his pony these days only when Houston trains, and the $2.9-million Seattle 
Slew yearling also galloped 1 1/2 miles in preparation for the one-mile, 
$75,000 Trial, which is the final Derby preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
Houston was undefeated in three starts until he ran fifth as the 4-5 favorite 
in the Santa Anita Derby. Sunday Silence beat him by 16 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas is attributing Houston's sorry performance to the 95-degree heat at Santa 
Anita, although other trainers in the race said their horses were not affected 
because the humidity was low. 
</P>
<P>
"The stalls as Santa Anita were about as ventilated as a coffin," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
"But one thing about that problem is that it's easily corrected. We had to get 
the horse's electrolytes balanced. We've been able to replace his fluids with a 
supplement that we've put in his water, fed him directly and even given him 
intravenously. We feel that we've got the problem under control." 
</P>
<P>
On a wet track listed as fast, Houston worked five furlongs last Monday in a 
rousing :58 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
The weather has been hot and humid here this week. On Thursday, the temperature 
was in the mid-80s, missing the record for the date by one degree. There was 
the chance of overnight rain Friday, and rain again early today, and the 
temperature at race time might be around 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Six horses are entered in the Trial, which in 62 runnings has produced only 
five Derby winners, the last being Tim Tam in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Today's lineup, in post-position order, consists of Affirmed's Image, Belek, In 
His Cups, Pulverizing, Houston and One That Got Away. Houston carries 122 
pounds, including Laffit Pincay, and spots the opposition three or five pounds 
per horse. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to make himself comfortable Friday in a director's chair outside a 
lavishly redecorated barn office that was only a cinder-block room a week ago, 
Lukas borrowed a copy of the Daily Racing Form and checked the records of the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Belek, undefeated in three starts, is owned and trained by Louie Roussel, who 
gave racing Risen Star, last year's Preakness and Belmont winner after running 
third in the Derby. Affirmed's Image has won his last three starts. In His Cups 
has won four of his last five races. Pulverizing is a stakes winner from 
Maryland and One That Got Away won on grass at Keeneland the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas is hoping for an easy win for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy race," the trainer said. "There are some horses in there that 
know how to win." 
</P>
<P>
Houston knew nothing else, until he ran up the track at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Half of the horses in the Derby Trial -- Affirmed's Image, In His Cups and One 
That Got Away -- are not eligible for the Triple Crown races and Louie Roussel 
says that Belek will not run in the Kentucky Derby because he figures to have 
limitations beyond a mile. . . . Notation, who was beaten by Belek at Keeneland 
before winning the Lexington Stakes there on Tuesday, will run in the Derby and 
Chris Antley is likely to be his jockey.
