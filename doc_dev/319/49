<P>
Unbridled, the unappreciated, won the 116th running of the Kentucky Derby 
Saturday, soundly beating Summer Squall and Mister Frisky, two more glamorous 
horses that sniffed the lilies instead of the roses at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, undefeated in 16 races, which made him the most successful Derby 
starter ever, was sent off as the 19-10 favorite. Then he became the 11th 
consecutive public choice to fail here. The Santa Anita Derby winner had the 
lead briefly on the far turn before he faltered, finishing eighth in the 
15-horse field, 19 1/4 lengths behind Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who had won seven of eight races, was the 2-1 second choice of 
the crowd of 128,257, and while giving a better account of himself than Mister 
Frisky, he was no match for Unbridled when the telltale running began. Summer 
Squall finished second, 3 1/2 lengths back and added to jockey Pat Day's legacy 
in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Day, who has won more races than anybody in the long history of Churchill 
Downs, is winless in eight tries in the Derby. The frustration was compounded 
Saturday, because Summer Squall gave Day an unprecedented three consecutive 
second-place finishes, and Unbridled is a horse that Day rode as recently as 
mid-March, when they won the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Day also won a race at Gulfstream Park with Summer Squall that day, and said 
after the Florida Derby that he was leaning toward Unbridled as his Kentucky 
Derby horse. But after Summer Squall won the Jim Beam at Turfway Park two weeks 
later, Day dropped his option on Unbridled, sending Saturday's winner back to 
Craig Perret. 
</P>
<P>
In the Blue Grass on a muddy track at Keeneland three weeks ago, Day rode 
Summer Squall to another victory, with Unbridled and Perret finishing third, 3 
3/4 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
Perret, 39, won on his fourth Derby mount, coming close with third-place Awe 
Inspiring last year and with runner-up Bet Twice in 1987. Perret thought that 
the Blue Grass was a useful race for Unbridled, and that it improved him about 
four lengths -- or the distance needed to perhaps beat Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong," Perret said Saturday. "After I worked him here, I felt that he 
had moved up about eighth lengths. Our goal was not to win the Blue Grass, our 
goal was to win the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall finished six lengths ahead of Pleasant Tap, the 40-1 shot. It was 
another three lengths back to Video Ranger, the horse from the $40,000 claiming 
ranks who was 1 1/4 lengths better than Silver Ending, the Arkansas Derby 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the wire, in order, after the first five were Killer Diller, Land 
Rush, Mister Frisky, Thirty Six Red, Power Lunch, Real Cash, Dr. Bobby A., 
Pendleton Ridge, Burnt Hills and Fighting Fantasy. Country Day was scratched 
from the Derby on Friday after fracturing a bone in his right foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the fifth betting choice, paid $23.60, $7.80 and $5.80. The other 
mutuels were $3.80 and $3.80 on Summer Squall and $12 for Pleasant Tap. 
Unbridled earned $581,000 of the $756,000 purse, running 1 1/4 miles in a 
creditable time of 2:02 on a drying-out track that was labeled as good. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, a big bay son of Fappiano and Gana Facil, is a Florida-bred who was 
bought by his owner, Frances Genter, for $70,000 at Tartan Farms' dispersal 
auction in 1987. Genter, 92, is a Minneapolis resident who has been in racing 
for 53 years. Before Saturday, she said that her biggest racing thrill was 
winning the 1951 Santa Anita Derby with Rough'n Tumble, a horse that cost 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, 48, a former rodeo bull rider who started training quarter horses 
in New Mexico in 1968 before moving to thoroughbreds a few years later, gave 
Perret few prerace instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"I only told Craig one thing," Nafzger said. "I wanted him to warm up the 
horse, to jog him. I wanted him to trot the horse a whole bunch." 
</P>
<P>
The jockey didn't have much to say to Nafzger, either. "If we just get that 
much run, I know we'll win this race." 
</P>
<P>
What Perret meant was shaking Unbridled loose in a large field. As it turned 
out, the colt's only problem was a squeeze between Fighting Fantasy and 
Pleasant Tap at the start. 
</P>
<P>
"After three jumps, we were fine," Perret said. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting Fantasy, who went off at 111-1, broke to the right, pushing Unbridled 
into Pleasant Tap. Fighting Fantasy made the lead in the run past the stands 
the first time, but dropped out of the race quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash held the lead going down the backstretch, with Mister Frisky and his 
jockey, Gary Stevens, running on his right flank. Thirty Six Red and Burnt 
Hills also were in contention then, with Summer Squall heading up the second 
tier of horses, about five lengths behind Real Cash. Unbridled was in sixth 
place, about eight lengths away from the front. 
</P>
<P>
On the far turn, Mister Frisky moved past Real Cash, but could hold the lead 
for only about 10 jumps. Summer Squall and Unbridled were rolling even faster. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure I could beat Pat at the five-sixteenths pole, but I knew then 
that it was just me and him," Perret said. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall moved past Mister Frisky, and Unbridled was accelerating right 
behind him. With a half-mile to go, Unbridled was following Land Rush, and 
Silver Ending was coming up on the outside. Perret was able to send Unbridled 
through the hole that those horses might have closed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key," Perret said. "The hole was there at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, on the outside, pulled away from Summer Squall just inside the 
eighth pole, completing the trip and the victory with only a couple of 
right-handed whacks from Perret's whip. 
</P>
<P>
"At the quarter pole, I saw Pat whipping his horse, and I said to myself, "Pat, 
you're in trouble,' " Perret said. "From the middle of the backstretch, I knew 
we were in good shape. I had a golden trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was just my day at Churchill Downs. This horse gave me a winning race at 
the eighth pole. I saw the progress he was making (since the Blue Grass). I 
knew he was coming to the race in the right way." 
</P>
<P>
Day didn't get his usual strong finish from Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked over my shoulder just about the five-sixteenths pole and I saw 
Unbridled coming," Day said. "When I looked back at my horse, he had his ears 
straight up. I mean, we were on the lead at that point just turning into the 
stretch, and he threw his ears up and just lost total concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"When Unbridled came by me, my horse got back into it, but it wasn't the burst 
that I anticipated that he was capable of. He came on down there with a 
half-hearted run. I think that he was capable of a better finish than that. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like he was a tired horse, but he wasn't exerting 100% of his effort 
at that point. My hat's off to the winner, but I think my colt could have made 
it a bit more of a horse race if he had just maintained his attention span. He 
just kind of lost his concentration momentarily at the head of the stretch and 
just never seemed to regain it." 
</P>
<P>
Perret rode Unbridled for the first time for a fifth-place finish in the 
Tropical Park Derby at Calder in January. Jose Velez had been riding Unbridled 
as a 2-year-old, but he broke his hip in a spill. 
</P>
<P>
In the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on March 3, Day rode Unbridled for the 
first time, because Perret was committed to Rhythm, the champion 2-year-old 
colt. Unbridled finished third and Rhythm, who eventually dropped out of the 
Kentucky Derby picture after throat surgery, was 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Unbridled's win in the Florida Derby was demeaned because of a 
slow time and the fact that it was only the third victory in nine starts for 
the colt. The Blue Grass, his next race, did nothing to swell Unbridled's 
reputation, except in the eyes of Nafzger and Perret. 
</P>
<P>
"They built a wall around Summer Squall and Mister Frisky (for the Kentucky 
Derby)," Perret said. "I guess if you win all 16 of your races, you're entitled 
to that, but I never felt this was a two-horse race. Quite a few horses in this 
race had a license to win." 
</P>
<P>
The overriding sentimental choice was Mister Frisky and trainer Laz Barrera, 
who had won the Derby with Bold Forbes in 1976 and the Triple Crown with 
Affirmed in 1978, before two heart surgeries and a dismissed California 
accusation that he had run a horse on cocaine in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera schooled Mister Frisky so much at Churchill Downs -- in the paddock and 
in the starting gate -- that the colt might have been Phi Beta Kappa. Mister 
Frisky, heated up and unruly before the Santa Anita Derby, was a model horse in 
the paddock on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to blame the track, but the horse didn't handle it," Stevens said. 
"When we made the lead, I thought the race was ours. But when Summer Squall and 
Unbridled started coming, my horse bobbled for three or four strides. He was 
uncomfortable. He had done the same thing during a workout here, and I had said 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I asked him for his best, and it wasn't there. The last eighth of 
a mile, I was more concerned about the well-being of the horse. I just took 
care of him the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Barrera said that Mister Frisky suffered a cut on his right front ankle, but it 
isn't serious. Stevens feels that Mister Frisky deserves another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled up all right, and if he's all right after this, I'd like to see him 
run in the Preakness," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The Preakness, the second leg in the Triple Crown, will be run at Pimlico on 
May 19. Unbridled will not be unappreciated when he runs in that one.
