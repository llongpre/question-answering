"You have perhaps the fastest racehorse in America," ABC commentator Jim McKay 
said to owner Bob Levy before his colt, Housebuster, ran in the Derby Trial 
Saturday. "Why will you not consider the Kentucky Derby for him?" 
</P>
<P>
Levy explained to a national television audience that he and trainer Jimmy 
Croll thought that Housebuster was basically a sprinter, but McKay wouldn't 
take no for an answer. "Well, what about the Preakness?" he demanded. And after 
Housebuster won the Derby Trial with an effortless 5 1/4-length victory, McKay 
was immediately back on the air to ask, "Well, Bob, what do you say now?" 
</P>
<P>
McKay's incredulity was understandable, because prudence and caution are 
qualities rarely seen at Churchill Downs in the springtime. The owners and 
trainers of decent 3-year-olds will rationalize, will deceive themselves, will 
ask horses to do the impossible to get to the Kentucky Derby. Many will go into 
next Saturday's Derby with horses who aren't remotely in Housebuster's class. 
Many would love to run a horse who would be in front as the field turned into 
the stretch. From that point, anything could happen. What trainer could resist 
such a chance to win America's most famous horse race? 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Croll could, because he's still haunted by memories of the last time he 
pursued the Derby with a horse who shouldn't have been here. The year was 1973, 
and the horse was Mr. Prospector, who might have been one of the most brilliant 
thoroughbreds of all time. We'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of his 3-year-old season, in only the third start of his career, 
Mr. Prospector ran six furlongs in an unbelievable 1:07 4/5. "Right away the 
owners were talking about the Derby," Croll said. "I tried to tell them he 
didn't have enough seasoning. I kept saying, 'We can't run in the Derby! We 
can't do it! We can't do it!' I wasn't successful in dissuading them." 
</P>
<P>
So Mr. Prospector came to Kentucky, where Croll tried to transform the 
speedster into the classic distance runner he wasn't cut out to be. The colt 
lost an allowance race in his first attempt to go a distance. Then he ran in 
the Derby Trial, where he was bumped around as if it were the roller derby, and 
he broke a cannon bone. He never ran for the roses; he never ran again at all. 
</P>
<P>
But after he went to stud and became one of the most influential sires in the 
world, Mr. Prospector proved what a special animal he was -- something that 
Croll had known all along. "He could have been one of the great ones; I truly 
believe that," the trainer said. "I never got over it." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Housebuster has given Croll a chance to relive the past, and to 
correct it. Like Mr. Prospector, the colt has displayed brilliant speed ever 
since he first set foot on the track. He won a seven-furlong stakes at 
Gulfstream Park this winter, defeating Summer Squall, the favorite for the 
Kentucky Derby, and Thirty Six Red, the winner of the $500,000 Wood Memorial at 
Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Housebuster doesn't have the pedigree to win the Kentucky Derby. This may 
sound unfair and elitist, especially in a country that reveres the concept of 
equal opportunity for all, but the truth is inescapable. While horses with 
humble pedigrees may win the Derby, horses with pure sprint pedigrees don't. 
Croll knows this. The trainer believes that Housebuster can be effective up to 
distances of a mile or thereabouts, but said that "our ultimate goal is to be 
the champion sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
With this goal in mind, Croll has assiduously avoided temptations that might 
divert him. When Housebuster was in Florida this winter, the 3-year-olds in the 
big-money stakes races were a rather weak group, and Housebuster probably could 
have beaten them even though he isn't a distance runner. But Croll passed the 1 
1/16-mile Fountain of Youth Stakes, explaining, "I think he could have won, but 
if he had we'd have had to go to the Florida Derby, and then if he'd run half 
decently he'd have to go somewhere else (the Kentucky Derby, for instance). I 
think it would have been the wrong thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
So Croll plans to spend most of the year finding appropriate spots at one mile 
or shorter for Housebuster. The Derby Trial, with a weak field and a $75,000 
purse, looked like an ideal place to test the colt at a mile for the first 
time. It was. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster battled head and head down the backstretch with another speedster, 
Falling Sky, but while his rival was under a drive, Housebuster was cruising. 
He sped the first half-mile on this dull racing strip in 45 3-5 seconds and 
jockey Craig Perret had him under wraps as he cruised to victory over Private 
School. Falling Sky was third. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a powerhouse," marveled Keith Allen, who rode the runner-up. 
Housebuster covered the mile in 1:37 3/5, a good time on this track, 
considering that cheap horses in the last race of the day required 1:43 3/5 to 
go that distance. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference between running this distance and one-quarter mile farther 
constitutes a whole new game, and requires a whole different type of horse. 
Casual fans may not understand this, and optimistic horsemen at the Derby might 
not either, but Levy and Croll do. When they put Housebuster on a van and ship 
him out of Churchill Downs, they won't have any doubts about the wisdom of 
their decision.
