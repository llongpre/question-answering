<TEXT>     "To be at the Breeders' Cup with an eligible contender is a great honor,"
said Carl Nafzger, trainer of Unbridled, who last year won the Derby and the
seventh $3 million Classic at Belmont Park.;   "This is where we show our best
horses for the world to see," said Nick Zito, trainer of Strike the Gold, this
year's Kentucky Derby winner.;   A total of 90 horses, 28 of them foreign-bred
or -based, will contest the seven Breeders' Cup races.;   Eight horses are
trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who has won 10 races with 65 starters and earned $8
million in the seven Breeders' Cups.;   Lukas would have had one of the top
choices in the Classic, the day's centerpiece, but he said Farma Way came up
with an inflamed ankle Tuesday and was scratched.;   The Classic lost another
horse-of-the-year candidate when In Excess was pulled from the Classic and
entered in the $1 million Mile on the grass -- to avoid, some cynics said, a
showdown with Farma Way.;   Two trainers with bright prospects on a day that
is supposed to cold but sunny are Ron McAnally and Jim Day.;   McAnally will
saddle Festin, a leading contender in the Classic, and Tight Spot, who goes
into the Mile with eight straight wins on grass.;   Day is expected to win the
$1 million Distaff with Canadian-bred 3-year-old filly Dance Smartly.;   Most
of the workouts were run Friday morning despite rain.;   "Everybody around
here says the course gets a little better with some rain," McAnally said. "But
it came down pretty hard, and I can only hope the wind helps dry the course.";
  Woody Stephens, the dean of U.S. trainers, said, "It'll test a lot of them.
But you throw them out there and see what they can do. Rain followed by sun
can dry out this track pretty fast.";   The weather and track condition were
just two more complications in the first national Pick 7.;   About 600 race
tracks and other sites will carry the races for bettors by television
simulcast. And the public has been invited to take a fling at betting on the
card. Industry insiders say the betting pool could reach $20 million and would
be shared by anyone who picks the winners of all seven races. A $2 lottery for
horse players.;   However, unlike lotteries, which reward pure luck, the Pick
7 rewards handicapping skill -- and pure luck. And lotteries routinely pay
jackpot winnings over 20-year periods, whereas the Pick 7 payoff comes in one
lump sum, minus the Internal Revenue Service's 20 percent cut off the top.;  
Of equine interest today will be the farewell races of Housebuster and Summer
Squall.;   Housebuster is expected to clinch a second straight divisional
title in the six-furlong Sprint before being retired to stud. Summer Squall, a
4-year-old colt who ran second to Unbridled in the 1990 Derby then beat him
the Preakness, will cap his career in the Classic.;   One horse was subtracted
from the herd Friday when Pat Kelly scratched Solar Splendor from the $2
million Turf. The 4-year-old gelding slipped on the turf course after a
workout Monday, and the trainer reported that "he's not 100 percent, and I
don't want to run him if he's not 100 percent . . . "; BREEDERS' CUP AT A
GLANCE; WHEN: Today, 9 a.m.; WHERE: Churchill Downs, Louisville, Ky.; TV: CH4
CH8; WHAT: Seven thoroughbred races with a total purse of $10 million. The
most important: the $3 million Breeders' Cup Classic for 3-year-olds and up.;
WAGERING: Bay Meadows' admission gates and mutuel windows open at 8 a.m. for
simulcasts of the Breeders' Cup. Post time for the first simulcast race will
be 9:16. After the Breeders' Cup program, an eight-race card is scheduled at
Bay Meadows. Satellite betting locations also open at 8 a.m.  </TEXT>
