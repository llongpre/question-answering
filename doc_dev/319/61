With a total of $10 million in the wind Saturday at Belmont Park, the trainers 
of the horses in the seven Breeders' Cup races will leave as little as possible 
to chance. Once a horse walks through the tunnel leading from the walking ring 
to the race track, its fate is taken out of the hands of the man who has done 
the planning and preparation and placed in the hands of a jockey who weighs 
about 110 pounds and must make decisions while going 40 m.p.h. straddling the 
withers of a 1,000-pound beast. 
</P>
<P>
The jockeys are left to deal with the actual heat of battle. A trainer may have 
methodically prepared a horse to be at his best on a given afternoon and every 
detail may be in place, but the difference between success or failure often 
depends entirely on the decisions and reactions made in fractions of seconds by 
the man on its back when the gate opens. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, 85 jockeys have ridden in 42 Breeders' Cup races, but only 19 have 
ridden winners, 16 Americans and three from Europe. Not surprisingly, the most 
successful riders on Breeders' Cup days have been the leading figures of the 
last decade -- the money riders, whose skills are in perennial demand by top 
stables. 
</P>
<P>
Six jockeys have won 22 of the 42 Breeders' Cup races. The same half-dozen have 
ridden the second finishers in 20 races and finished third on 20 others. That 
totals 62 of a possible 126 placements, almost 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The leader is Laffit Pincay, who has ridden in 39 of the 42. The 43-year-old 
native of Panama has ridden five winners: Tasso in the '85 Juvenile, Capote in 
the '86 Juvenile and Skywalker in the '86 Classic, Is It True in the '88 
Juvenile and Bayakoa in the '89 Distaff, his finest Breeders' Cup moment. 
</P>
<P>
He has the mount on Bayakoa again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Cordero, who has ridden in more Breeders' Cup races, 38, than anyone 
except Pincay, shares second position in wins with Pat Day. Each has four, 
although Day has had fewer mounts, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Cordero's victories have come in the Sprint, which he won astride 
Dancing Spree for trainer Shug McGaughey last year at Gulfstream Park, and on 
Gulch in 1988. His other winners have come aboard D. Wayne Lukas-trained 
fillies, Life's Magic in the 1985 Distaff at Aqueduct and Open Mind in the 1988 
Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero also shares the lead for second-place mounts in the Cup with Chris 
McCarron. He is in position to win the Sprint for a third straight time when he 
rides Dancing Spree, who appears to be his most formidable mount in the seventh 
Cup. In the Turf he will ride El Senor, a horse who always has a chance at 12 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Day rode the first Classic winner, long-shot Wild Again, was on Lady's Secret 
in the 1986 Distaff and rode two winners in '87, Epitome in the Juvenile 
Fillies and Theatrical in the Turf. He has not ridden a Breeders' Cup winner 
since, although he was on heavily favored Easy Goer in the '88 Juvenile and the 
'89 Classic. His most prominent mount on Saturday is Kentucky Derby winner 
Unbridled in the Classic, and he will ride Jalaajel in the Mile. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, Jose Santos and Randy Romero each have ridden three Breeders' Cup 
winners.
