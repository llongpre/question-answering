Easy Goer Saturday encountered the type of muddy track that had brought about 
his defeat twice before. This time the conditions didn't faze him. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old accelerated in the stretch to win the Woodward Handicap at 
Belmont Park by two lengths over longshot Its Acedemic. It was his fourth 
consecutive victory and moved him a step closer to the 1989 horse-of-the-year 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer had little to fear from his four rivals in this 1 1/4-mile test; but 
when morning rain made the racing strip muddy, even his trainer, Shug McGaughey 
was fretting. "I was worried about it all day," McGaughey said. "I didn't know 
how he'd do over this race track." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the trainer nor any fan could forget the colt's loss as the 1-to-5 
favorite in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last fall, or his dull second-place 
finish as the favorite in the Kentucky Derby. If he couldn't handle the mud 
Saturday he was going to be vulnerable, because the others in the field were 
able off-track performers. 
</P>
<P>
And at a couple of stages in the Woodward the favorite did look as if he might 
be ripe for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Slew City Slew dashed to the early lead, as expected, and raced to a 
four-length lead without any real pressure. He was setting a fairly slow pace 
-- a half mile in 48 1/5 seconds -- as Its Acedemic and Forever Silver stalked 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Midway on the backstretch, both Easy Goer and Proper Reality rushed up from the 
rear of the pack and looked as if they were going to challenge for the lead. 
But Easy Goer didn't go past the leaders; instead, Its Acedemic and Forever 
Silver surged away from him. 
</P>
<P>
But jockey Pat Day wasn't worried. "We had three-eighths of a mile left, so I 
wasn't really concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forever Silver and Its Acedemic were vying for the lead as they turned into the 
stretch, but Day angled to the outside and let the favorite roll. When he did, 
it became apparent that the outcome of the Woodward had never been in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer accelerated past the leaders with ease and won by two lengths over 
the 26-to-1 Its Acedemic, with Forever Silver another three-quarters of a 
length back in third place. Proper Reality was fourth and Slew City Slew last. 
</P>
<P>
The winner covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:01, a time that was respectable but 
hardly sensational. Despite the mud, the track was firm enough that good 
sprinters had been able to run six furlongs in 1:09 3/5 earlier in the day. The 
time would seem to confirm the notion that Easy Goer might not be quite as 
effective on wet ground as he is on dry. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey had been determined to run in the Woodward regardless of the 
conditions because he thought the timing of the race was ideal to prepare Easy 
Goer for his major objective, the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park Nov. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
And while McGaughey certainly will be worrying about the ideal course for his 
horse to take in the coming weeks, but one thing he won't have to worry about 
any more is mud.
