<P>
Three of the seven favorites in Saturday's $10-million Breeders' Cup races will 
have to overcome unfavorable post positions on Gulfstream Park's peculiar 
course. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 89 horses were entered Wednesday in the sixth annual Breeders' Cup. 
Three horses each in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and Turf Stakes are on the 
also-eligible list, because fields are limited to 14 starters, so it's likely 
that only 83 horses will run. 
</P>
<P>
The morning-line favorites are Easy Goer at 6-5 in the Classic, El Senor at 3-1 
in the Turf, Zilzal at 9-5 in the Mile, Bayakoa at 6-5 in the Distaff, On the 
Line at 7-2 in the Sprint, the entry of Adjudicating and Rhythm at 5-2 in the 
Juvenile, and Stella Madrid at 5-2 in the Juvenile Fillies. The races are worth 
$1 million apiece, except for the $3-million Classic and the $2-million Turf. 
</P>
<P>
Favorites that will have to be at their very best because of the luck of the 
draw include Bayakoa, considered the best filly or mare in the country; Zilzal, 
undefeated and given the best chance of winning among the European entries, and 
El Senor, who has had traffic problems and wide trips in several of his 
non-winning races. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa drew post No. 1 in the 10-horse Distaff; Zilzal will break from No. 10 
in the 13-horse Mile, and El Senor is on the outside in the Turf, which has a 
capacity of 14 starters. 
</P>
<P>
The two horse-of-the-year candidates that will account for most of the betting 
in the Classic will be as far away from each other as they can be at the start 
of the race, with Easy Goer coming out of the No. 1 stall and Sunday Silence 
breaking from No. 8. California-based Sunday Silence, who beat Easy Goer in the 
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and then ran second to his New York rival in 
the Belmont Stakes, is listed as the 2-1 second choice in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence likes to be close early, and Easy Goer prefers putting in a late 
run. It would seem that Easy Goer might suffer from the inside post, where 
there is always the chance of getting shuffled back for the run down the 
backstretch, but the Classic has a relatively small field, and Shug McGaughey, 
who trains the colt, said he is happy with the position. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Croll, who is starting Arlington Lassie winner Trumpet's Blare in the 
Juvenile Fillies, has trained horses at Gulfstream for more than 25 years and 
is familiar with the track, which has tight turns, an unbanked grass course and 
a new dirt racing surface that concerned trainers last week. The main track got 
better by the weekend but may change again if the predicted scattered 
thundershowers occur today and Friday. Gulfstream's main track is a mile in 
circumference, and the turf course is seventh-eighths of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Post positions are important in mile races on grass and mile-and-sixteenth 
races on dirt here," Croll said. "If you draw outside, you can lose a lot of 
ground around the first turn." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the 2-year-old races -- the Juvenile and the Juvenile fillies -- are at 
1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The reason a No. 1 post might be all right for Easy Goer in the 1 1/4-mile 
Classic and not for Bayakoa in the 1 1/8-mile Distaff is that Bayakoa is a 
front-running mare. Outside her will be other speed horses -- Highest Glory, 
Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and Winning Colors -- all of whom are capable 
of crowding Bayakoa going into the first turn. If Bayakoa is not a factor in 
the early pace, the victory chances improve for the late-running Open Mind, the 
best 3-year-old filly in the country, and Goodbye Halo. 
</P>
<P>
The hot-blooded Bayakoa has lost only twice in 10 starts this year. In one 
loss, she broke from the No. 2 post and was unable to get rolling early; in the 
other, she was in the first stall and broke through the gate while waiting for 
the other horses to load. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas, who trains Highest Glory, Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and 
Open Mind, has 11 Breeders' Cup starters and is happy with all of the post 
positions they drew. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' Steinlen, the 4-1 second choice behind Zilzal in the Mile, has a chance 
to win the national grass title for males with a victory Saturday. Steinlen, 
who will break from the No. 2 post, has six wins, three seconds and one third 
in 10 starts during a most consistent year, and has won races at distances 
ranging from a mile to 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Zilzal, a Kentucky-bred, English-raced son of Nureyev who was bought for 
$750,000 as a yearling by Sheik Mana al Maktoum, has never lost, winning three 
races at seven furlongs and two at a mile. The 3-year-old colt's smallest 
margin of victory has been three lengths and he has won by as many as 10 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen this horse's record," Lukas said. "But this will be the first time 
he has raced around a course with left-handed turns, and he won't be used to 
the dead-flat grass surface that they have here." 
</P>
<P>
The Sprint, which hasn't been won by a favorite since Eillo took the inaugural 
running at Hollywood Park in 1984, was won last year by Lukas' Gulch, and the 
trainer with a record nine Breeders' Cup victories is shooting for another win 
in the six-furlong race with On the Line. The Sprint is so unpredictable that 
On the Line has been made the favorite even though he has finished behind 
Dispersal, Sewickley and Sam Who -- other starters Saturday -- in recent races. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who won five consecutive sprints in California in midyear, breaking the 
track record for six furlongs at Hollywood Park. On the Line avenged one defeat 
with a victory in the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del Mar, where Sam Who stumbled 
at the start and finished fourth, but in the Ancient Title Handicap at Santa 
Anita on Oct. 18, Sam Who was a four-length winner, in the same time of 1:08 
that he registered at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, the 4-1 second choice in the Sprint, drew the No. 13 post. The horse 
outside him is Safely Kept, the only filly in the field and undefeated in eight 
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Because 19 horses were pre-entered in the Sprint a week ago, there was some 
question whether Sam Who would get in the race. When fields are oversubscribed, 
a point system based on high 1989 finishes determines nine of the starters, and 
a panel of racing officials picks the otherfive. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 13 is supposed to be superstitious," said Henry Moreno, Sam Who's trainer. 
"But I'm not superstitious. I'm just glad to be in the race. Good horses should 
win no matter where they start."
