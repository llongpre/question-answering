His 2-year-old season was shortened by a hairline fracture of the cannon bone, 
and he bled heavily after a workout earlier this year. He could stand to gain 
some weight, and he's run three races in the past 1 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't sound like much of a horse, but he's won seven of eight career starts. 
His name is Summer Squall, and he'll be one of the favorites in Saturday's 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never been a big, strapping horse . . . and he looks littler sometimes 
because he doesn't carry a lot of weight," said Cot Campbell, head of the 
Dogwood syndicate that owns Summer Squall. "But he's got a great engine." 
</P>
<P>
Either Summer Squall or the unbeaten Mister Frisky, winner of a North 
American-record 16 in a row including the Santa Anita Derby, will be favored 
when 15 to 17 3-year-olds are entered on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the field will be Gotham and Wood Memorial winner Thirty Six Red, 
Arkansas Derby winner Silver Ending, Florida Derby winner Unbridled, and three 
colts trained by D. Wayne Lukas -- Land Rush, Real Cash and Power Lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Summer Squall's twisting road to the Derby, his trainer, Neil Howard, 
says his colt is "coming up excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do anything different," he said. "He had a little bit of a tight 
campaign, but we had to grab what was available. I'm very happy with the way 
things have gone, and if he runs a good race, I'll be thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall worked a half mile in 48 2/5 last Saturday, and Howard said he 
would breeze him again today. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was part of a five-horse package offered by Dogwood Farm at 
$55,900 each for 40 shares. Twenty-eight people bought those shares and now are 
considered his owners, although Campbell has broad power to administer the 
syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was unbeaten in five starts as a 2-year-old when he was sidelined 
the rest of the year by the cannon fracture in August. Then, after a workout in 
February, he came off the track bleeding from the nose. Campbell believes the 
bleeding was caused by a fungus, and there has been no recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
The bleeding, however, interrupted his training, and he didn't make his 
3-year-old debut until March 17 in the Swale at Gulfstream Park, where he lost 
for the only time in his career. He was beaten by a length over seven furlongs 
by the ace sprinter, Housebuster. He followed that with victories in the Jim 
Beam and Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil called me on Feb. 19," Campbell recalled. "I said, 'How's things?' and he 
said, 'Not good. He bled.' I was flabbergasted. There was never any indication 
it was coming. I remember the feeling. It was not a jolly time." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell called the bleeding significant. Bleeding is fairly common among 
thoroughbreds, but normally it is internal and can be detected only through 
tests. This blood was visible. 
</P>
<P>
"But he didn't get sick. He was bright that day. He bled, but he didn't know 
it," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he ran so well in the Swale, it was almost like our Triple Crown," 
Campbell said. "We were ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Probably because of the three quick races this spring, Summer Squall lost 
weight. Campbell guessed he was down to about 950 pounds, and Howard said he 
had Summer Squall on a special feeding program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see 25 or 30 more pounds on him," Campbell said, "but he has added 
some since the Blue Grass. His coat looks good, and he's full of gusto." 
</P>
<P>
The Dogwood syndicate purchased Summer Squall at the Keeneland select yearling 
sale in 1988 for $300,000. Since then, he's earned $785,078.
