BLUE-COLLAR COLT STEALS WORLD'S RICHEST RACE  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Chicago?;   After an undercard dominated by foreigners, a blue-collar colt
named Black Tie Affair won the world's richest race, the $3 million Breeders'
Cup Classic, and left horse-of-the-year voters with some difficult choices.;  
After Black Tie Affair left Twilight Agenda 1 1/4 lengths back and favored
Festin a dull sixth, trainer Ernie Poulos mused: "They said he hadn't beaten
this horse and that horse. . . . ";   Poulos' voice dropped into the kind of
growl you would expect from a 65-year-old, 280-pound former semi-pro lineman:;
  "He's beaten 'em now.";   Black Tie Affair, a Chicago-based, Irish-bred
5-year-old, was just the horse to tweak the Kentucky bluebloods on racing's
$10 million day.;   He and Poulos chased respectability around the country all
summer, winning races at Churchill Downs, Detroit, Ak-Sar-Ben (Nebraska),
Monmouth (New Jersey) and Arlington (Illinois). A victory over Farma Way in
the Iselin Handicap finally put them on the map.;   Pat Day rode Black Tie
Affair in the Iselin and three other wins, but Day preferred Summer Squall in
the Classic, and Jerry Bailey took the mount. Bailey then turned in a
memorable ride, walking through the early fractions but producing the first
wire-to-wire victory in the 8-year-old race.;   "Speed wasn't holding all day,
and that may have entered the minds of some other riders," said Bailey, who
rode his first Breeders' Cup winner.;   The ralliers never had a chance.
Festin came in sixth; Strike the Gold finished fifth; Unbridled was third.;  
Even before Bailey nuzzled the gray Black Tie Affair through a slow-paced
wire-to-wire victory, 66,204 fans had watched the horse-of-the-year picture
turn several shades.;   In Excess, dominant in the New York summer handicaps,
and Tight Spot, 8 for 8 on grass going into the $1 million Mile, both tired
badly in the stretch and finished in a dead heat for ninth behind Opening
Verse.;   Meanwhile, the Canadian filly Dance Smartly kept her championship
hopes alive with a 1 1/2-length victory under Day in the $1 million Distaff,
and the French 2-year-old Arazi surged into contention with an electrifying 4
3/4-length win in the $1 million Juvenile that had jockey Pat Valenzuela
punching the air in delight.;   They were the only two favorites to come
through on an afternoon that included huge upsets.;   (check) $1 million
Sprint -- Sheikh Albadou ($54.60), an English 3-year-old.;   (check) $1
million Mile -- Valenzuela-ridden Opening Verse ($55.40), a Kentucky-bred colt
who began his racing career in France.;   (check) $2 million Turf -- Miss
Alleged ($86.20), a Kentucky-bred filly who had been 0 for 6 this year in
France and Maryland, ridden by Eric Legrix.;   (check) $1 million Juvenile
Fillies -- Even Pleasant Stage ($10), the Eddie Delahoussaye-ridden 2-year-old
who outkicked fellow Californian La Spia is trained by a transplanted
Englishman, Chris Speckert.; BREEDERS' CUP RESULTS; Race 1 -- Sprint;
3-years-old and up Distance: 6 furlongs.; Horse           Jockey        Win

Housebuster, Take Me Out, Senor Speedy, Clever Trevor, Deposit Ticket, Key
Spirit, Media Plan.;   Comment: Sheikh Albadou was the lone European entry. A
winner of only three races, he  was making only the ninth start of his career,
his first in the United States and his first on a dirt track. The 3-year-old
colt is owned by Hilal Salem and bred in Britain.; ...; Race 2 -- Juvenile

Miss Iron Vivano, Soviet Sojourn, Anh Duong, Miss Legality, Culture Vulture,
Spinning Round, Ken de Saron, Speed Dialer, QueensCtQueen.;   Comment:   
Pleasant Stage, a California-based 2-year-old daughter of 1981 Kentucky Derby
winner Pleasant Colony, burst past La Spia at the wire to win by a head. Eddie
Delahoussaye brought her out of the gate last in the field of 14 and held her
in restraint most of the trip but guided her from 11th place entering the last
turn.; ...; Race 3 -- Distaff; 3YO &amp; up  1 1/8 mile.;   Horse

Also ran: Fit For A Queen, Til Forbid, Lady D'Accord, Wilderness Song, Private
Treasure, Richard's Lass, Fit to Scout, Train Robbery, Grand Girlfriend,
Queena;   Comment:    Dance Smartly locked up an Eclipse Award as champion
older female this year and completed an undefeated year (eight victories in
eight starts).  Dance Smartly passed Lady's Secret to become the
all-time-leading female in lifetime earnings with more than $3 million and
became the first Canadian-bred to win a Breeders' Cup race.; ...; Race 4 --

paid $834.20.;      Also ran: Shadayid, Danseuse Du Soir, Priolo, Scan, In
Excess, Kooyonga, Jolie's Halo, Sultry Song, Tight Spot, Second Set, Polar
Falcon.;   Comment: Opening Verse had not won a race since May 3, but that
race also was at Churchill Downs and he obviously displayed a fondness once
again for the track's turf course. He went around  tiring front-runners coming
out of the final turn and drew off to win by 1 1/4 lengths.; ...; Race 5 --
Juvenile; 2YO  1 1/16 mile.; Horse          Jockey        Win Place Show;

Tri to Watch, Showbrook, Star Recruit, Bag, Big Sur, Devil On Ice, Dance
Floor, Offbeat.;   Comment:   For the record: Arazi  is an aviators'
checkpoint somewhere in the desert near Yuma, Ariz. The  European invader 
obliterated his U.S. rivals and won by 4 3/4 lengths.    The winning margin
was the biggest in the eight runnings of the Juvenile, which traditionally
produces the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby.; ...; Race 6 -- Turf; 3YO
&amp; up  1 1/2 mile.; Horse           Jockey        Win Place Show;   f-Miss

Classic, Filago, Pistol Bleu, Saganeca, El Senor, Saddlers' Hall, Pigeon
Voyageur, Kartajana, In The Groove, Dear Doctor.;   Comment: Miss Alleged
upsets Itsallgreektome, as a member of the mutuel field, by half a length.  
Itsallgreektome also finished second in last year's Breeders' Cup Mile, when
he lost to Royal Academy by a neck.   Filago pulled up lame in the race with
what was reported to be an injury in his lower right front leg.; ...; Race 7
-- Classic; 3YO &amp; up  1 1/4 mile.; Horse             Jockey       Win Place

McCarron       12.20 7.80; Unbridled         C Perret               4.60;
Time: 2:02.1. $5 Exacta (8-9) paid $146.60.;      Also ran: Cudas, Summer
Squall, Star of Gdansk, Chief Honcho, Fly So Free, Festin, Strike the Gold,
Marquetry.;   Comment:    With the fresh horse he had after the slow trip
around the course, jockey Jerry Bailey had enough in the tank to hold off
Twilight Agenda.    The fractions made the race, yet this is not to say that
Classic VIII was an easy proposition. There were in the field of 11 two
Kentucky Derby winners, Unbridled and Strike the Gold; a Preakness winner,
Summer Squall; the Jockey Club Gold Cup winner, Festin; and major stakes
winners like Chief Honcho, Twilight Agenda and Marquetry.   Kentucky Derby
winners had won the last four runnings of the Classic, but with Unbridled
third and Strike the Gold fifth, the $1.56 million winner's purse went to a
horse who was viewed as no more than a sprinter last year.  </TEXT>
