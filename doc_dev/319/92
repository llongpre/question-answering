Unbridled was installed today as the favorite for Saturday's $500,000 Florida 
Derby at Gulfstream Park, and the long shot claimed the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Streava, official odds maker for the track, didn't wait for the drawings 
before making Unbridled, who finished third in the Fountain of Youth stakes, a 
5-2 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Ross's Warning, the long shot at 20-1, drew the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day will ride Unbridled, which drew the fourth position in the nine-horse 
field. Slavic was rated second at 3-1 and drew the eighth position; Single Dawn 
was set at 4-1 and drew the ninth position for the 1 1/8-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
Roanoke was at 6-1 and drew the sixth position, followed by Country Day at 8-1 
starting in the fifth position. Run Turn, at 10-1, was at the seventh position 
and Top Snob, at 12-1, drew the third slot. Late entry Sunny Serve, also at 
12-1, claimed the second spot. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials also announced that the Swale Stakes will be moved up to the 
fifth race because of the interest in several potential contenders in this 
year's somewhat muddled 3-year-old field. 
</P>
<P>
The race was originally scheduled to be run 11th, after the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream officials expect a fast track Saturday with warm and breezy weather. 
</P>
<P>
In the Swale Stakes, Summer Squall, on medication after bleeding in a workout a 
month ago, was installed as a slight favorite at 8-5 with Housebuster at 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, trainer for Unbridled, said he was a little surprised that his 
horse was picked as a Florida Derby favorite but said: "I don't get too excited 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
He was pleased with the position drawings for his two horses, Unbridled and Top 
Snob. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real happy. . . . You don't want the rail and you don't want to be too 
far on the outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries and lackluster performances this year for some of the early 
Kentucky Derby contenders, the Florida Derby and the 3-year-old picture remain 
filled with question marks. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the race is wide open," said Sonny Hine, trainer for Ross's Warning. 
"That's why we're going to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret, who will be riding Roanoke, said he feels that the best horses 
this year have yet to have strong showings. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes the Florida Derby a wide-open thing," he said.
