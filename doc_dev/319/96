There were no big surprises when the 1988 Eclipse Awards were announced 
Wednesday, with Alysheba, Personal Ensign, Ogden Phipps and Shug McGaughey 
heading the list of winners, and California horses and horsemen getting shut 
out in the few elections that gave the voters options. 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, winner of the Santa Anita Handicap early in the year and first in 4 
straight major races, including the Breeders' Cup Classic, at the end, was 
voted the Eclipse -- thoroughbred racing's equivalent of an Oscar -- for best 
older male horse. Alysheba, whose earnings of $3.8 million last year enabled 
him to retire with a record-breaking $6.6 million, is a cinch to be named horse 
of the year when the result of that vote is announced on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Personal Ensign was voted the best older female. She completed an undefeated 
career with a stirring victory, by a nose, over Winning Colors, the Kentucky 
Derby winner, in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. The first undefeated champion since 
Colin in 1907-08, Personal Ensign won all 7 of her starts last year and 
finished with 13 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The people around Personal Ensign and one of her stablemates also won Eclipse 
Awards: Phipps, 80, was named the year's outstanding breeder and owner; 
McGaughey, who turns 38 Friday, was voted best trainer, and Easy Goer, another 
Phipps-McGaughey horse, was voted best 2-year-old colt. Phipps' horses earned 
more than $5.8 million, and from only 38 starters in major races, McGaughey 
produced 15 wins, 10 seconds and 5 thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Other Eclipse winners were Open Mind, 2-year-old filly; Risen Star, 3-year-old 
colt; Winning Colors, 3-year-old filly; Sunshine Forever, male grass horse; 
Miesque, female grass horse; Gulch, sprinter; Jose Santos, jockey, and Steve 
Capanas, apprentice jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron finished second to Santos in the only split vote among the three 
participating groups -- turf writers, racing secretaries at most major tracks 
and Daily Racing Form personnel. The turf writers and Racing Form voted for 
Santos but McCarron drew the support of the racing secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 219 ballots were cast, 70 more than in 1987, when the Eclipse system 
was criticized because only 63% of the eligible voters participated. 
</P>
<P>
For Santos, the Eclipse ended 3 years of frustration, during which he has led 
the country in purses every time but never won the award. In 1988, with purses 
of $14.7 million, he broke Laffit Pincay's 1985 record by about $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Santos beat McCarron by about $150,000 in the money race. 
McCarron, winning 17 major races to Santos' 9 and winning a record 5 races 
worth $1 million or more with Alysheba, Forty Niner, Pay the Butler and King 
Glorious, was one of several California-based candidates who came up empty in 
the Eclipse voting. The others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Lukas, whose stable won a record 3 Breeders' Cup races at Churchill 
Downs and broke its own annual record with another $17-million year, lost out 
to McGaughey in the trainer vote, preventing him from winning a fourth straight 
award, which would have tied Laz Barrera's record. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' horses fared better than their trainer, however, for he and his son, 
Jeff, trained 3 of the Eclipse winners -- Winning Colors, Open Mind and Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gene Klein, who, like Lukas, had won the owner award 3 straight years. In 
1988, Klein's horses won about $5.5 million, while running in four times as 
many races as the Phipps stable did. Winning Colors and Open Mind race for 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fernando Valenzuela, whose horses earned more than $1.7 million in Southern 
California, was among the runners-up to Capanas, who won about $2.2 million 
with more than twice as many mounts while competing on a lesser circuit in New 
Jersey and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- King Glorious, the undefeated 2-year-old colt and winner of the Hollywood 
Futurity. The voters chose Easy Goer, winner of 2 major races in New York and 
second, with excuses, to Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Easy Goer 
beat Is It True 3 times in New York. A virus cost King Glorious some training 
time, preventing him from running in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Great Communicator, who beat the champion, Sunshine Forever, in the 
Breeders' Cup Turf and 7 weeks later won the Hollywood Turf Cup. Great 
Communicator won 6 stakes to Sunshine Forever's 5 and both horses won 3 major 
races.
