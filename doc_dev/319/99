UNBRIDLED MAY LACK VERSATILITY NEEDED TO SUCCEED AT PREAKNESS

The character of the Kentucky Derby winner usually dictates the flavor of the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
There is the charismatic Derby winner. Secretariat, Seattle Slew and 
Spectacular Bid were of this type. They brought to Pimlico the shared 
anticipation of singular accomplishment. A truly special horse can carry 
Preakness week by himself. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side of charisma's coin is the type that comes to Maryland 
having to duplicate the success of Kentucky to establish themselves. Winning 
Colors, Alysheba, Ferdinand, Swale, Sunny's Halo, Pleasant Colony and Genuine 
Risk fit beneath this umbrella. Some succeed; most fail. The Derby and 
Preakness may be racing's second-toughest winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions are the horses accompanied to Baltimore by the anticipation of a 
rematch. Affirmed was dogged by Alydar, Sunday Silence by Easy Goer. These are 
the most compelling Preaknesses and the most rare. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled fits neatly into the second category. He is a one-paced stayer, 
probably at his best at about 1 1/4 miles, always at the mercy of pace and 
forever dependent upon the ability of his rider to avoid trouble. He was 
clearly the best horse May 5 at Churchill Downs, and he won the Derby 
impressively for 92-year-old owner Frances Genter. But he will not be an 
overwhelming Preakness favorite Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger was confident throughout Derby week that Unbridled would run his 
race. He was correct. In fact, every horse in the Derby except Summer Squall 
ran Unbridled's race. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
This is a different game, and Unbridled must display versatility he may not 
have. Pleasant Colony, Alysheba and Sunday Silence passed this test. Genuine 
Risk, Sunny's Halo, Swale, Ferdinand and Winning Colors failed. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky will be a factor in Baltimore. If he can control the track in a 
field with a good deal less speed than the Derby, where five horses were sent 
after the lead in a suicidal early pace, he threatens to be the Snow Chief of 
1990: incinerated in Louisville, exonerated in Baltimore. He worked five 
furlongs in 59 2/5 seconds Sunday at Pimlico, significantly faster than he 
worked at Churchill a week before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
But will Mister Frisky control the pace? Kentucky Jazz is the cheap-speed 
portion of Wayne Lukas' entry with Land Rush and has the potential to dictate 
the race's development. Champagneforashley is another ingredient. He has the 
necessary tactical speed. He is fresh and a month off the Wood Memorial. He 
should be suited to the distance and will not lose touch with the pace. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Summer Squall. Is this where he falls off the table? His 
performance and his appearance were incongruous in Kentucky. He walked sorely 
to be saddled, appearing to favor his left foreleg, was hollow beneath the hip 
bones and with ribs protruding. His connections say there is nothing that can 
be done for his unsightly appearance, but Summer Squall is fine. And he ran his 
heart out as far as he held up in Kentucky, gaining the lead from a tired 
Mister Frisky near the mile mark and holding everyone safe except Unbridled.
