   Felix Wankel, inventor of the rotary
engine, has died at age 86.
   Wankel died on Sunday, said Thomas Burkhardt, a close friend of
the German inventor.
   Wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926 and began producing
the new motor at the West German NSU Motor Works in 1957.
   Through the years, Wankel also designed motors for the Japanese
auto companies Mazda and Toyota, as well as engine superchargers.
   The West German NSU Spider was the first car to be mass-produced
with the Wankel rotary engine, that was in 1964. The now-defunct
NSU company also produced the RO 80 Wankel rotary engine car, which
had a reputation for unreliability and was discontinued in 1977.
   There was much interest in Wankel's rotary engine in the 1960s
and early 1970s. According to West German automobile industry
figures, in 1971 Wankel was working with 24 different companies
around the world on plans to further develop his engine.
   But the first oil crisis of 1973-74 changed all that, bringing a
drastic loss of interest in investing in the automobile industry,
experts say.
   Mazda continued work on developing the Wankel rotary engine and
made the concept a successful one.
   According to industry figures, Mazda has produced more than 1.5
million cars with rotary engines including the popular RX-7 sports
car.
   In 1976 Wankel also developed a streamlined amphibious car he
called ``Zisch,'' German for ``whoosh,'' which was able to reach 62
mph with its 300 horsepower engine.
   Wankel's research offices are in Lindau, on the shores of Lake
Constance in southern West Germany.
   Wankel's wife died in 1978. They had no children.
