Tucked away at one end of Atco-Qualcast's half-mile long lawnmower factory
at Stowmarket, Suffolk, 16 workers grouped in an assembly cell aremaking a
new rotary mower.
No more than a week's supply of all the parts they need are stored on view
next to the cell, and conveyed on a carousel from which the team members
choose the parts they need. The team also chooses temporary workers to help
in busy times.
The cell is part of a pilot scheme introduced over the past few months at
Atco-Qualcast, and symbolises the changes underway - and long overdue - at a
company whose name includes two of the strongest brands in the UK lawn-mower
industry, but which in 1990 seemed destined for the corporate compost heap.
It is no easy job introducing change into a long-established, traditional
company but the challenge is no doubt greater when the company is based in a
small, quiet town that still displays some traditions rarely seen nowadays
in big industrial centres: There is no staff canteen, for example, because
many workers live nearby and go home for lunch.
But by avoiding moving too quickly, and by gradually fostering a spirit of
co-operation between management and workforce to replace years of
confrontation, Mr Stephen Roberts, managing director, believes the seeds
have been sown for turning Atco-Qualcast into an industrial success.
Mr Roberts joined Atco-Qualcast as marketing director in 1991, three years
after its former owner, Birmid Qualcast, had been acquired by Blue Circle,
the big cement maker. Atco-Qualcast had already been suffering from a
classic squeeze - declining sales and market share, and rising fixed costs
and stock levels at its two plants in Stowmarket and Derby - but the
acquisition also coincided with drought conditions that dented lawnmower
sales.
Blue Circle identified Atco-Qualcast as a non-core activity, but selling it
was never going to be easy. 'It was not viable on two sites and needed to
cut costs if there was to be any hope of selling it,' he says.
Against a background of overcapacity in a depressed market, and losses
during 1990 and 1991, the company eventually decided in April 1991 to close
the Derby plant, and consolidate manufacturing at Stowmarket. If the
decision had gone the other way, says Mr Colin Barker, manufacturing
director and a Derby man himself, it would not have been easy to have
persuaded Stowmarket workers to move.
Mr Barker had the challenging task of combining two operations with entirely
different philosophies. The Derby plant produced the mass-market Qualcast
machines, and was a high-volume low variety operation - an assembly plant
with some manufacturing, says Mr Barker.
Stowmarket, meanwhile, produced the large, premium-priced Atco machines and
the mid-range Suffolk mowers in medium to low volumes, high variety, and
batch-production rather than flow-line assembly. In contrast to Derby, it
was a manufacturing plant with some assembly.
The consolidation had an obvious effect on Atco-Qualcast's fixed cost base,
but it went a long way beyond simply bringing two plants together.
The company needed to make a number of other changes too, said Mr Barker. It
had to match production much more closely to sales, moving away from a
system which seemed always to produce too many or too few mowers.
Sales in the UK lawnmower industry depend on a unique mix of factors
including the weather and consumer confidence/spending power and are very
hard to predict. Inflexible manufacturing methods, therefore, make it
difficult both to react to overall changes in volume sales and to switch
quickly between products depending on market conditions. Last year, for
example, unit sales were nearly the highest ever at 1.39m but in a recession
consumers have bought cheaper mowers.
One important action taken was to reduce the permanent workforce to 500 from
900, through the closure of the Derby site, and increase the use of
temporary workers to around 120-150 each season - the first five months of
the year are the busiest time and many temporary workers then go to work in
agricultural jobs.
This has reduced the risk of short-time working for permanent employees and
 -along with the abolition of piecework - given the necessary labour
flexibility.
By moving warehousing off-site and ending the production of tractors and
cultivators, space was created for six assembly lines which were set up in
1991 to handle the extra work from the Derby closure. Large, inflexible
assembly lines based on moving conveyors were avoided.
Over the past two years, Atco-Qualcast reduced its finished goods and work
in progress by Pounds 8.4m, and in 1992 it returned to profit - Pounds 1.3m
before interest and tax.
By the end of that year a number of parties had become interested in what
had become a much more saleable company, but Mr Roberts and four other
executives - Mr Barker, Mr Brian Slythe, sales director, Mr Gordon
McMeechan, finance director, and Mr Arland Shawe-Taylor, technical director
 -pipped them to the post after being given seven days by Blue Circle to
organise a Pounds 17m buyout, backed by the Candover venture capital group.
The assembly cell for the rotary Quadtrack mower, and a nearby cell for a
new hedgecutter, are examples of further changes made since the deal.
A new Pounds 500,000 paint plant, which began operating earlier this year,
is aimed at dramatically raising productivity by replacing what Mr Barket
calls 'Dante's Inferno,' a manually operated paint shop. When this is
removed, further space will be created.
Some Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m has been spent since the buy-out, and there
has been a solid improvement in financial performance. In the first half of
last year profits rose 12 per cent to just over Pounds 4.5m on an 8 per cent
increase in sales to more than Pounds 30m on a comparable basis.
By reducing the cost base, the traditional losses in the much quieter second
half of the year will have been reduced. But the creation of space in the
factory gives the opportunity not only of plugging a few gaps in
Atco-Qualcast's lawnmower range but also, Mr Roberts hints, for eventually
finding a new business that might reduce the company's 'seasonality'.
