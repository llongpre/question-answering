<LEADPARA>  HIGH-QUALITY garden tools can last a lifetime with proper care. The steel
heads on hoes, shovels, rakes, spades, trowels and picks should be kept clean,
sharp and rust-free; rotary mower blades should be sharpened and balanced
every few months.;    Here are tips to help keep tools in top shape:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box)  CLEANING: Clean tools after each use and store them in a dry place.
Scrape off mud and dirt with a putty knife or similar tool, and wash off the
remaining dirt with a hose.;    Remove rust with a wire brush, sandpaper or a
rust-removing chemical, then apply oil with a brush or rag.;    To clean and
oil a hand tool in one easy operation, fill a 5-gallon bucket with sand and
add used oil drained from the crankcase of your mower or car. Thrust the tool
into the oil-soaked sand several times. The blade will emerge clean and oily.
Repeat the process occasionally during gardening season to prevent rust.;   
(box)  SHARPENING: Keep cutting and digging edges sharp to make gardening
easier and to prevent possible breakage caused by excess pressure on tool
handles.;    You can sharpen shears, sickles, pruning knives and other cutting
tools by grinding, filing, or using a special sharpening stone such as a
whetstone or slipstone.;    If a cutting edge is very dull or nicked, it
should be power-ground or filed to remove the nicks and restore the bevel.
Knives, scissors or axes should be finished to a sharp edge with a whetstone
or slipstone.;    To sharpen digging tools, place the tool in a vise and use a
coarse 1O-inch file to restore the original edge -- usually a 45-degree bevel.
On files, the bevel should be on the outside edge of the blade. A 60-degree
bevel is best for general use; a 30-degree bevel for cutting heavy weed
growth. On hoes and shovels, sharpen the corners as well as the cutting
edges.;    It's very important to keep axes sharp. Clamp the head of the ax,
edge up, in a vise. Use a medium-cut mill file, never a power grinder, which
may ruin the blade's temper. Hold the file flat against the head and draw it
upward toward the cutting edge, lifting off at the end of each stroke.;   
File both surfaces, rounding them to a convex profile. Retain this profile to
the corners of the blade; don't taper the corners. Check the edge by looking
down its length. Bright spots indicate dull areas. Keep filing until the edge
looks almost invisible. Finish by honing the edge with a round slipstone.
Slide the stone along one side and then the other in a circular motion.;   
(box)  SHARPENING ROTARY MOWER BLADES: Rotary mower blades should be sharpened
and balanced twice a season, or at least frequently enough to retain the
original cutting-edge angle.;    A dull blade will tear the grass instead of
cutting it and will also strain the engine; a badly nicked blade can cause
vibrations; an improperly sharpened blade may not provide enough lift to pick
up the grass and will cut the lawn evenly.;    To sharpen a rotary mower
blade, follow these steps:;    (check) Always disconnect the spark plug or
unplug the power cord first. Grasp the blade in a gloved hand or with a heavy
rag and loosen the securing nuts or bolts. If a bolt sticks, apply penetrating
oil to the bolt and tap the wrench with a hammer.;    (check) Remove the blade
and check the stiffener for cracks or bends. If you need to replace the
stiffener, use a manufacturer's recommended part -- a bent or homemade part
can cause vibration that will damage the engine.;    (check) Clamp the blade
in a vise and sharpen with a medium-cut flat file along the original angle of
the cutting edge. File in one direction only -- toward the edge. You can also
use an electric-drill sharpening attachment, available in hardware stores.;   
(check) Use a screwdriver or knife as a pivot through the center hole of the
blade to balance it. Check the balance one way, then flip the blade over and
check again. If the same end of the blade drops consistently, file some metal
from the rear of the heavy end (not from the cutting edge). This will lighten
the blade without harming the edge.;    (check) If the blade is balanced both
ways, reinstall it, making sure the lifts point upward toward the deck when
the mower is right side up.;    (check) A bent blade will make a ragged cut,
may scalp the lawn in spots and the vibrations may cause serious engine
damage, so it's best to replace it.  </TEXT>
