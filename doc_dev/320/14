THEY WERE fast, compact and made in Germany but, apart from being hugely
enjoyable to drive, that was all they had in common.
The Ford Escort RS Cosworth is what aerospace people would call the ultimate
stretch of a basic machine. The Porsche 968 is the latest model from a small
company that once had a booming business making costly, top-quality sports
cars for motoring connoisseurs.
The Escort RS Cosworth came about because Ford is determined to win the
world rally championship. The rules for rallying's group A say 5,000 units
(2,500 from 1993) must be built in a year before a car can be approved for
competition use.
In essence, it is the complete four-wheel drive power train of a Sierra RS
Cosworth - itself a formidable motor sport machine - shoehorned into an
Escort body shell. Its two-litre, four-cylinder, 16-valve engine develops
227 horsepower. Driven brutally, the Escort leaps from 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh)
in 5.7 seconds - a Ferrari Testarossa takes 5.8 - and has a 140 mph (225
kmh) maximum. All of which is likely to be of academic interest to business
motorists who persuade their employers or partners to let them have one.
What the UK insurance companies have to say about this hottest of all
hatchbacks will depend on the driver's record and where it is to be kept.
Almost inevitably, it will be in Group 20, the highest of all. Even a
saintly member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, with a life-long
no-claims bonus and a lock-up garage, will pay a hefty premium. The insurers
will decide each case individually. Ford has fitted it with a double-lock
security system and an engine immobiliser - and, yes, a police version is
already under development.
As everyday transport the Escort RS is pleasanter than you might think
possible. Before getting behind the wheel, I had eyed the bonnet top vents,
the all-too-obvious aerodynamic aids and ultra-squat tyres suspiciously.
Within 10 minutes, I had been charmed. Forget the aggressive looks. When
developing the car, Ford's special vehicle engineering department at Dunton,
Essex, ensured it would be easy and rewarding for normal people to drive.
Used responsibly, its slingshot acceleration makes overtaking - especially
on slippery roads - quick and safe. Steering response is instant and power
assistance ensures parking is effortless. The Escort RS glues itself to a
winding road and storms up sinuous hills. But it does not fidget or ride
uncomfortably at the sort of speeds possible only on an autobahn (although
not, I fear, for much longer). The gearshift is good and the clutch is not a
muscle-builder.
A lot of the credit for the Escort RS's civilised demeanour belongs to the
Pirelli P Zero Corsa size 225/45ZR16 tyres. They are as squat as the last
generation of Formula 1 racing tyres and safe for continuous use at more
than the car's maximum speed.
Normally, a very high performance tyre with a cross-section more than twice
as wide as high creates lots of road roar and thumping. Pirelli has managed
to make the Escort RS's specially developed P Zero Corsas ride with the
noise and comfort levels of a tyre three sizes smaller.
Standard and Motorsport versions of the Escort RS are Pounds 21,380. A
luxury model which costs Pounds 23,495 (Pounds 23,976 with hide trim) can
have a CD player and heated front seats as extras. Firm orders with deposits
have been given for 500 of the 700 Escort RS's to be sold in Britain this
year. Let us hope they can all get insurance.
The most remarkable things about the Porsche 968s are their prices, starting
at Pounds 34,945 for a hardtop coupe with six-speed gearbox. A cabriolet
with power hood is Pounds 38,724.
Had the 968 been introduced two years ago, prices probably would have been
10-15 per cent higher. But Porsche sales have been hit hard by the
recession. More realistic pricing is seen as one of the ways back to
prosperity.
Porsche's unique Tiptronic transmission adds another Pounds 2,152. It can be
used as a four-speed automatic or a manual gearbox with instant, clutch-less
changes. I reckon it would be worth every penny to an owner who commutes to
town during rush hour but likes to shift for himself on the truly open road.
Although the 968 clearly is derived from the 944, which was run out at cut
prices earlier this year, 82 per cent of its components are said to be new.
The engine is three litres with four cylinders. That makes it sound like
something from a truck. In fact, it is very smooth when spinning freely (it
has contra-rotating balance shafts) and produces more torque, or pulling
power at a given speed than any other naturally aspirated three-litre
engine.
When first I drove an open 968 cabriolet in Germany a year ago, I thought it
felt like being in a low-flying Tiger Moth, but quieter and much faster. In
sunny Berkshire a few days ago, I had to be more circumspect. But even at
speeds which do not put licences at risk, Porsche quality shines through.
The power-assisted steering is razor sharp. Reserves of roadholding and
handling are too great to be explored on public roads. The ABS brakes are
reassuringly powerful. Porsche claims top speeds of 156 mph (251 kph) for
the manual car, which has quite close ratios in its silky gearbox, and 153
mph (246 kph) for the Tiptronic.
An Escort RS would beat both to 60 mph (96 kmh) from a standing start - the
manual by nearly one second, the Tiptronic by just over two seconds. Does
that matter? I doubt it. Porsche buyers are no longer the city wide boys of
the loadsamoney days.
Porsche is only too aware of the temptations in the path of posh sports car
buyers. Competition includes the twin-turbo V6 Nissan 300ZX (Pounds 30,962)
and rotary engined Mazda RX-7 (Pounds 22,202). The arrival of the Mitsubishi
3000GT in Britain in August (mainland Europe in September) will not help.
Acquiring a Porsche always was more than just buying a new car. It still has
connotations of paying the entry fee into a club that is not open to drivers
of Nissans, Mazdas and Mitsubishis - or Escort RS Cosworths, for that
matter.
The UK is an important market to Porsche. The 968 - also with a group 20
insurance rating - is priced keenly by Porsche standards. It is expected
first to hold the fort and then to rebuild sales. It will be followed by a
relatively cheap (around Pounds 23,000 to Pounds 25,000 at today's values)
sports car, but this is still several years off.
