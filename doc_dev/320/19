   The first Rotary club in the Soviet Union has
been officially established after several years of
behind-the-scenes efforts, the president of the international
service organization said Sunday.
   A tired but happy Hugh Archer, president of Rotary
International, said three years of contacts between Soviet
ambassadors and Rotary officials from around the world led to his
final journey this weekend through the Soviet bureaucracy.
   ``It was difficult from the standpoint of intrigue, in getting
the word to the person who could help us,'' Archer said in a
telephone interview Sunday night after returning from to Moscow.
   ``Nobody there wishes to speak as an individual. What we had to
do was get a lot of people convinced that it was OK to have a
Rotary club started in Moscow.''
   Archer finally got approval from Soviet officials for a
provisional club that will initially be made up of about 25
business and professional people from Moscow.
   Rotary International, which has over 1 million members in more
than 100 countries, has forged growing links with Eastern Europe in
recent years. In June 1989, Rotary established its first clubs in
Poland and Hungary since World War II, said John O'Brien, a
spokesman for Rotary International, based in suburban Evanston, Ill.
   Archer first met with Soviet officials in December to explore
the possibilities of opening a club in Moscow. He also visited a
group eager to form a club in Tallinn, the capital of the Soviet
republic of Estonia.
   In a key discussion Saturday with Deputy Minister of Foreign
Affairs Vladimir Petrovsky, Archer said he received assurances the
club can meet and select members without surveillance or
restrictions and that it will be allowed to maintain contacts with
clubs in other countries and contribute financially to the
association.
   Rotary's constitution prohibits it from becoming part of another
organization or being restricted by government or political forces.
   ``It all follows from (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev
because of his reforms that sort of paved the way,'' O'Brien said.
``But Rotary has not gone cap in hand begging to open a club.
   The members of the provisional club in Moscow, who have been
holding informal meetings for the past six months, range in age
from 30 to 50. They include two lawyers, three businessmen, a
theater manager and the head of a translation service.
   Archer said the group was delighted when told of the agreement
and immediately began discussing ideas, especially exchange
programs with other countries involving Rotary members, as well as
high school and college students.
   He said the Soviets at first had trouble understanding that they
were expected to help people without receiving anything in return.
   ``The concept of service as practiced by Rotary and other groups
is that you enjoy it'' without expectation of compensation, Archer
said. ``I think they got that idea.''
   Rotary, founded in Chicago in 1905, is a not-for-profit service
organization consisting of business and professional men and women.
It sponsors educational and charitable programs and has a budget of
$56 million for 1989-90.
