   A rules change adopted by Rotary
International will allow Rotary clubs worldwide to join their U.S.
and Canadian counterparts in accepting women members.
   Rotary International's council on legislation, meeting in
Singapore, adopted a change in the service club's constitution and
bylaws that will allow the 23,900 clubs in 164 countries to admit
women starting July 1, club officials said.
   The new provision will not require that women be included, and
clubs in some countries are expected to continue to ban them.
   U.S. clubs began admitting women in June 1987 after the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld a California law requiring service clubs to
admit women. Canadian Rotaries followed last November after clubs in
Montreal argued that exclusion of women violated the country's laws.
   Nearly 11,000 of the 420,000 Rotarians in Canada and the United
States are women.
   But until this week, international documents of the club still
called it an organization for ``adult male persons,'' Mim Neal, a
spokeswoman at the club's Evanston headquarters said Friday.
   The legislative council, with members from around the globe,
voted 328-117 to change the constitution and bylaws. The new
membership provisions will be sent to all clubs.
   If 10 percent of the clubs oppose the change, the decision will
be reconsidered at the Rotary International convention in Seoul in
May, Ms. Neal said.
