   The Rotary clubs launched a project Friday to
encourage members to help clean up the Earth, a sure sign that even
the ``sensible middle'' has gone Green, a federal official said.
   ``These people are not environmental radicals,'' said Richard J.
Smith, a special negotiator on environmental affairs for the State
Department, after addressing about 350 members of the Evanston,
Ill.-based Rotary International.
   ``These are a very solid, center group ... who are tremendously
influential (and) are beginning to think carefully about the
environment,'' he said.
   Rotary International claims some 1.1 million members in 25,000
Rotary clubs worldwide.
   The civic group traditionally has confined itself to service
projects such as the eradication of polio. In tackling the
environment, Rotary turns itself to what some may consider a more
political arena.
   But the group's world president, Paulo Costa, said the demand
for an improved environment is too urgent to ignore.
   ``The rush for development has pushed our ecosystem to the
breaking point,'' the Brazilian told the group. ``We have to change
our habits.''
   People at the conference planned workshops to develop specific
strategies for improving the environment through their clubs. Costa
urged members to begin by educating themselves of the problems in
their own backyards.
   ``Education is the true, real key,'' said Costa, who said the
threat to the rain forest in his nation first prompted him to
consider the new Rotary project.
   ``I see Rotary as an umbrella organization, a clearing house of
information,'' he said.
   Rotary members were encouraged to start environmental resource
centers, address ecology issues in their own communities, and use
environmentally sound practices in their everyday lives.
   They were also issued a list of ``101 ways you can help
`Preserve Planet Earth.''' Among the tips: sweep rather than hose
down sidewalks; clean air conditioner filters monthly; and fix
broken things rather than junking them.
   ``You represent the sensible middle _ and that's what we have to
engage if the job's to be done,'' Smith told the group.
