   Rotary International, the worldwide service
organization, opened its first club in the Soviet Union on Tuesday,
expanding its network to 169 nations.
   The Moscow club has 25 members, including businessmen, a theater
manager and the head of a translation agency, officials of the group
said.
   The organization has never had a club in Moscow. It was evicted
from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after those independent states
were annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II, said Rotary
President Hugh Archer.
   It was also evicted from 19 other countries ``where heavy
socialist ideology was the one selected by the government,'' said
Archer, of Dearborn, Mich.
   ``In the U.S.S.R., being a socialist country, it too had that
impression that Rotary was not a welcome member in its society,'' he
said.
   In the past three years, Rotary began receiving inquiries from
Soviet officials and citizens. The political changes that have
occurred in Eastern Europe ``opened the door even wider,'' and the
organization was invited this year to open a Moscow club, he said.
   Rotary also plans to open branches in Leningrad, Kiev and
Irkutsk, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Viktor Mozolin, a lawyer and business law professor who is
president of the Moscow club, said its opening was ``connected to
the whole process of democratic reform in the Soviet Union.''
   When asked whether the Communist Party and other Soviet agencies
did not already perform the humanitarian and service activities that
Rotary sponsors, Mozolin said there would be the ``duplication of
some functions which belong in this country to the Communist Party,
as well as our Komsomol and the unions and maybe some other
humanitarian organizations .... But I don't think this will be a
repetition of the functions.''
   Komsomol is the Communist youth league.
   The club is seeking to ``join together people from different
professions and various political views,'' Mozolin said.
   Rotary, which brings together community and business leaders to
build international goodwill, opened clubs this year in East Germany
and Czechoslovakia, Archer said.
