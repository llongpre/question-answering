<LEADPARA>  THE next time you anguish over having to mow your lawn, blame Edwin Beard
Budding.;   Budding's invention -- patented in 1830 as a "machine for mowing
lawns" -- allowed the closely cut lawn to expand into middle-class gardens.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before Budding's machine, lawns had either been cropped by sheep and
rabbits or mowed laboriously with a scythe. That made the lawn, which dates to
ancient times, almost the sole domain of the wealthy.;   Today, lawns are the
most widespread feature of American gardens. During the 1980s, roughly 60
percent of U.S. households (single-family and apartments) had lawns, according
to surveys conducted by the Gallup Organization. About 40 percent maintained
houseplants or outdoor flower gardens.;   That makes for 30,000 acres of lawns
in the United States, said Beverly Roberts, manager of the Lawn Institute in
Pleasant Hill, Tenn.;   Roberts, who has been tracing the history of the lawn,
said scientists estimate that grass started as a plant 70 million years ago.
Virtually from its beginning, mankind has cultivated lawns in one fashion or
another.;   Ancient Chinese emperors kept extensive areas of closely cropped
grass as part of their royal parks. In Rome, from 27 B.C. to A.D. 395,
patricians established lawns around their villas so they could see who was
approaching. In Babylonia, Assyria and ancient Persia, garden carpets
consisted of various low-growing plants, including some grass.;   In medieval
Europe, lawns surrounded monasteries, convents and palaces. As the Renaissance
arrived, so did more carefully crafted gardens.;   English colonists in
America imported the village green, a public lawn where citizens gathered for
political debates, executions and celebrations.;   New England communities
established dooryard gardens, largely identical house after house. The small,
fenced gardens eventually grew into expansive lawns as residents sought to
identify intruders.;   But well-kept lawns were still largely limited to
wealthy landowners. Then in the 1800s, technology brought lawn maintenance
within the reach of the middle class.;   Budding's invention consisted of a
cast-iron drum and a wood roller -- a forerunner of the reel mower still used
today, especially at golf courses.;   Advertisements for Ransome's of Ipswich,
the firm that bought rights to the machine, told potential purchasers to put
their weight on those parts to push the machine forward.;   Things got
somewhat better in 1902, though, when both British and American firms
developed the first motor-driven mowers. In the United States, Col. Edwin
George attached a gasoline engine from a washing machine to create what would
become the Moto-Mower.;   Subsequently, rotary mowers were developed. The
latest gimmick is "grasscycling," mowers that turn the clippings to mulch,
then return that to the lawn.;   Early ads for Budding's original design
demonstrated the mower's rapid social progress, according to Christopher
Thacker in "The History of Gardens.";   The original ads showed a man
straining to use a bulky machine. Within a few years, the ads pictured an
elegant gentleman gently pushing a much smaller machine. Some ads later on
featured Queen Victoria, Roberts said.;   In 1841, Jane Loudon welcomed
Budding's invention in her influential book, "Ladies' Companion to the Flower
Garden.";   "A substitute for mowing with the scythe has lately been
introduced in the form of a mowing-machine," she wrote. "It is particularly
adapted for amateurs, affording an excellent exercise to the arms and every
part of the poddy body; but it is proper to observe that many gardeners are
prejudiced against it.";   By the 1870s, however, the mower's use had become
widespread. Beeton's "Dictionary of Gardening" said that the useful machines
had edged out the scythe as the accepted way to trim the lawn.;   And we've
been pushing forward ever since.  </TEXT>
