<LEADPARA>  SOME THINGS in the Rotary Club landscape are as unchangeable as the face of El
Capitan.  Rotarians still sing ("You are welcome at our Ro-ta-reeee"); greet
dignitaries ("Will all the district governors and their spouses please come to
the head table afterward to get their picture taken"); exchange flags, plaques
and pins with visitors; and do good works.;    All these traditions were
observed Thursday when Richard King of Fremont (second tenor and America's
highest ranking Rotarian) introduced Paolo Costa (first tenor and president of
Rotary International) to a crowd of 200 Rotarians and their spouses at King's
home club, Niles Rotary in Fremont.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sharon de Sousa (mezzo soprano) even sang Costa's theme song, "Honor
Rotary," in Portuguese, the official language of his native Brazil and the
heritage language of many local Rotarians.;    An architect and business
executive from Santos (a suburb of Sao Paulo), Costa and his wife, Rita,
traveled the globe since he took office last July. King and his wife, Cheri,
have accompanied them for 140,000 miles, keeping a pace that King called
"exhausting.";    But some things do change in the Rotary world. Costa travels
with a new environmental message: Preserve planet Earth.;    Speaking as a
Brazilian "and a citizen of the world," Costa said in an interview after his
club speech, "What happens in one country affects all countries. . . . The
Alaska oil spill affected the water and animals of several nations." He is
mobilizing Rotary's unique network of 25,000 service clubs in 173 countries to
think green. (Rotarians have already planted 32 million trees worldwide in
recent months.) Though he hopes to raise money for a new "Green Cross" program
to protect the environment, Costa urged, "Don't put this in dollars, put this
in conscience.";    To promote his campaign, Costa has been meeting with
leaders in 38 countries and the United Nations. A scheduled meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev Jan. 16 may be postponed because of the
Persian Gulf crisis. (Geography note: There are now Rotarians in Moscow. There
are no Rotarians in Iraq.);    Costa also presented Paul Harris Fellowship
medallions (each representing a $1,000 contribution for scholarships to study
abroad) to Mae Avila, in honor of her late husband, Harry Avila Sr., donated
by Harry Avila Jr; to real estate agent Dick Irwin; to Barbara Rankin, given
by her husband, Ken Rankin, business administrator of Fremont Christian
School; and to Keely Warren, given by her father, Dick Warren, CEO of
Washington Hospital.;    On other matters Portuguese, Avila reports that
through the magic of matching grants, Niles Rotarians and their counterparts
in Horta (Fremont's sister city in the Azores) last year provided $10,000 for
equipment at an orphanage and special education school there.;    Digging in
locally, Rotarians will plant 120 trees on the Ohlone College campus within
the next few months.; (hbox);    WAY WITH WORDS: Architect Cathy Simon of the
San Francisco firm that designed the Fremont Main Library noted recently that
Portland, Ore., artist Larry Kirkland was responsible for placement of the
three significant words from poet T.S. Eliot -- "Knowledge, Wisdom,
Information" -- that march in handsome gold letters inside the rotunda. "But
not the fourth word," she cautioned.;    The fourth word is "exit." It's white
on green glass.;    And that brings us to the next library item -- an exit.
Bob Ammon, hard-working treasurer of People for A Permanent Library, presented
the library with a check for $23,754 a week ago, the last of the group's
$104,692 fund-raising effort. After six years, the group -- which helped build
the library and set up its gift fund -- now closes its book.;    Ammon also
turned in another library hat, that of Fremont Library Advisory Commissioner
-- a post he's held off and on for seven years. "Mayor Bill Ball told me, 'But
I already reappointed you,' " Ammon said with a laugh. "Guess I'll just have
to un-appoint myself.";    Anyhow, the job is open on the nine-member
commission. (No pay, but lots of lively presentations at the meetings held
every other month, says chairwoman Pat Lane.) If you're a library buff who
wants to serve, send a letter of interest to the Fremont City Clerk, 39100
Liberty St., Fremont 94538, or call Sandi Pantages, Fremont Main Library
Manager at (415) 745-1424.  </TEXT>
