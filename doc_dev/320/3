   Like any car that has been around for a decade, the Mazda RX-7
has changed. The car is wider and more expensive. The outside
styling is more rounded, and the RX-7 has been transformed from a
spirited scooter to a more substantial sports car.
   But thankfully, some of the best features remain: the durable,
smooth rotary engine, the sporty handling and nimble responsiveness,
and the rear-drive design.
   The performance of the Mazda RX-7 GTUs test car clearly showed
that many of the selective changes over the years have helped keep
the RX-7 a viable competitor in the sports car field.
   The engine in the test car, teamed with five-speed manual
transmission, started easily and worked smoothly in both city and
highway driving. The GTUs is not the fastest sports car around, with
a rating of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph, but it had plenty of
good, steady zip. And there's a higher-priced, turbocharged RX-7
model that offers even quicker acceleration.
   I also appreciated the fact that the rear-drive design meant
there was no torque steer under hard acceleration as there is in so
many front-drive sporty cars. Though I noticed that the test car
gulped down the fuel, I was impressed by the high-revving rotary
engine, especially knowing it has earned a reputation for
reliability.
   A Mazda spokesman noted that RX-7s ``have done extraordinarily
well in endurance-related racing.'' Consumer Reports also ranks
highly the RX-7s of the 1982-87 model years. They consistently
earned a much better than average label in the magazine's survey of
car owners.
   The Mazda spokesman mentioned the loyalty among many RX-7 owners.
With about 41,000 members, the RX-7 clubs around the country are
rank as one of the largest collection of clubs honoring a single car
marque.
   Fit and finish on the test car was superb. The ventilation system
was powerful, and the seats _ redesigned for 1989 with more lateral
support _ were firm and sturdy, which I appreciated as I got
accustomed to the car's hard, sporty ride.
   There was only room for two in the GTUs test car, though Mazda
offers a two-plus-two GXL model.
   Behind the two front seats in the test car were two deeply
recessed storage boxes with locks followed by a flat hatchback area
with luggage straps to keep items from sliding around. The hatchback
lid popped all the way up with a touch of a lever that was to the
lower left of the driver seat.
   However, I found it a bit awkward to bend over the back of the
car body and reach way inside the hatchback area. Yet because of the
hatchback's sloping lid, the taller items I carried always had to be
placed up front, behind the seats, which also was the hardest spot
to get at.
   The RX-7 GTUs comes with automatic shoulder belts that were the
most sensitive _ and comforting _ I've seen. If I suddenly tried to
reach for the glove box, or even move forward to look to the right,
that driver belt would hold me in.
   The dashboard layout was clear, easy to read, with no digital
gadgets. The blinker was a little lever on the dashboard, like that
in the Ford Probe, and the lights that warn that the brake is on,
the hatch is open or that something is wrong under the hood were
uniquely grouped next to the clock in the middle of the dash.
   The RX-7, at $6,995 for its April 1978 debut in the United
States, was a mid-priced sports car in its early days and still
holds that position, though its price range today is from $17,300 to
$25,600.
   A Mazda spokesman said competitors include Toyota MR2, which
starts around $14,000, and the Chevrolet Corvette, which starts
around $31,000.
   Partly because of the higher prices for sports cars, partly
because of increased competition from sporty coupes that offer
seating for more than two passengers, and partly because of rising
insurance costs, sales of the RX-7 have been declining. They hit
56,205 in 1986, then fell to 38,345 in 1987 and 27,814 in 1988,
Mazda said. Sales of about 20,000 are expected this year.
   Because of the increase in insurance costs, some buyers are being
quoted prices for insurance on their sports cars that are higher
than their monthly car payments, a Mazda spokesman said.
   A typical RX-7 buyer has median age of 36, according to Rod
Bymaster, product manager of sports and sporty cars for Mazda Motor
of America. Sixty-five percent of RX-7 buyers are male, and half are
married, he said. Sixty-seven percent have a college degree or more,
and the median household income is between $55,000 and $60,000.
   Though Mazda now is promoting its newest two-seat car _ the
Miata, which starts at $13,800 _ the company said the RX-7 will
remain. The Miata is coming into the lower end of the sports car
market because the RX-7 has moved upscale, a spokesman explained.
