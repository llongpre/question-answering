   Rotarians and their families have converged
on the city in record numbers, and merchants are rolling out the
welcome mats for conventioneers who are spinning a bonanza for
business.
   By Monday, 16,037 Rotarians and their families had registered
for the 79th convention of Rotary International at the Civic
Center, making it the largest such convention in the city's
history. The Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that they
will spend more than $7 million just for meals and lodging before
the five-day convention ends Wednesday.
   ``We've had a great day,'' Tricia Cuddy, manager of Cacharel, a
downtown French couture boutique, said Monday. ``We've had a lot of
activity, and out of eight purchases, three of them have been by
Rotarians.''
   At Convention Hall on Monday, Prince Bertil of Sweden praised
Rotary International as being ``kind and generous'' for devoting a
day of its convention to Sweden, and said the organization's
programs are important.
   ``Since the founding of this colony ... the history of American
and Swedish relations has been one of mutual frienship and
respect,'' Bertil said.
   The convention set aside Monday as Swedish Celebration Day in
observance of the 350th anniversary of the founding of a Swedish
colony in America.
   Bertil was joined by retired Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg
and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive officer of
Scandinavian Airlines of Stockholm, Sweden.
   Bertil appeared as representative of his nephew, King Carl XVI
Gustaf, who served as patron of the service organization's
PolioPlus Campaign in Sweden. The PolioPlus Campaign is to raise
funds to purchase polio vaccines for children around the world.
