   The first Aeroflot plane to land at O'Hare
International Airport in 14 years touched down with more than 100
young Soviet professionals Tuesday night and was greeted by American
sponsors bearing yellow roses.
   The Soviet airliner landed about 6:30 p.m., nearly an hour late.
   Sergei Chelnokov, chairman of the Committee of Youth
Organizations of the Soviet Union, said his group was tired from the
15-hour flight from Moscow.
   ``But if you look in our eyes, you will see we are very excited
to arrive in this country on this very historic occasion,'' he said.
   The Soviet visitors, ages 28 to 40, planned to spend 2{ days in
the Chicago area as guests of Rotary International before traveling
to Philadelphia on Thursday for a seven-day U.S.-USSR Emerging
Leaders Summit and to Washington, D.C., for a four-day visit, Rotary
officials said. They were to return to the Soviet Union on Dec. 10.
   The roses, symbolizing friendship, were presented to the
visitors, few of whom spoke English.
   ``We want to provide a nice sort of prelude,'' Rotary spokeswoman
Martha Wilson said of the floral greeting. ``This (visit) kind of
complements real well what we're trying to do.''
   Members of the 80 Rotarian families that will open their homes to
the Soviets used nametags to match visitors with their hosts.
   ``I'm really excited about it,'' said Leon Liss of Lisle. ``We
might even show them a McDonald's and the Sears Tower.''
   Aeroflot charters to Chicago stopped in 1974 because of ``policy
differences'' between the Soviets and the United States, Rotary
officials said, and Aeroflot flights to New York and Washington,
D.C., stopped in 1982.
   Regular service between the two countries resumed in April 1986
as tensions between the two countries eased, said Nicolai Lisachev,
New York manager for Aeroflot. The Soviet airline now has two
regular flights a week from Moscow to New York, and one from Moscow
to Washington, D.C.
   Lisachev said no regular flights to Chicago are planned
immediately.
   The Soviet visitors, who include television anchorman Vladimir
Pozner, represent 16 professions, including the clergy and the
military, Ms. Wilson said.
   ``We want to give them an idea of what the Midwest is like,'' she
said from Rotary headquarters in suburban Evanston. ``We (also) want
to show off Chicago a little bit.''
   The Philadelphia meeting officially is sponsored by the American
Center for International Leadership and a Soviet organization called
the Committee of Youth Organizations. The groups asked Rotary to be
host of the Chicago visit, Ms. Wilson said.
   Wednesday's schedule included dinner _ with turkey and all the
trimmings _ at a downtown hotel, as well as a visit to the Art
Institute of Chicago. Mayor Eugene Sawyer was to speak to the group
at a luncheon.
   Jim Duffy, principal of Glenbrook North High School in suburban
Northbrook, and his wife, Mary, were two of the 80 Rotary families
preparing to play host to the Soviets.
   ``We're having roast beef for dinner,'' Mrs. Duffy said. ``But
also, I'm making a chocolate cake _ certainly typical of this
American family.''
