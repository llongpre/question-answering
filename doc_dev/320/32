Rotary International, an independent business and charitable organization, will 
open its first club in Moscow this week and hopes to start chapters in half a 
dozen other Soviet cities, the organization's president said today. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Muscovites, including two lawyers, a theater manager and a 
professional translator, will meet officially for the first time after three 
years of difficult negotiations seeking guaranteed independence for the club.

"The (Soviet) government wanted to appoint the Rotary club members but we 
backed away from that," said Hugh Archer from Rotary's headquarters here. "They 
also wanted us to join the Committee for Youth Organizations but we refused to 
have connections." 
</P>
<P>
There are also groups ready to start clubs in Leningrad, Kiev, Irkutsk and the 
Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia.
