   The Lake Geneva Rotary Club's Farm
Drought Relief Fund got its first contribution from an unlikely
source _ the Grateful Dead.
   On June 29, Mayor Spyro Condos sent a bill for $1,200 to Alpine
Valley Music Theatre. Condos said so many people _ 60,000 _ had
been drawn to the area for Grateful Dead concerts last month that
Lake Geneva had had to hire extra police to help control crowds.
   In response, Condos said Monday, the band sent the city $2,000,
including $500 for the police department reserve fund and $1,500
for the fund to help farmers get livestock feed.
   Condos presented the $1,500 to Rotary officials Monday night,
during the club's benefit concert by Woody Herman's Young
Thundering Herd. Dave Tasse of the Rotary Club said Tuesday that
exact figures were not available yet, but that the benefit
attracted several hundred people and raised several thousand
dollars for the fund.
   The $15-a-ticket concert marked the club's first benefit to earn
money for the fund, said Rotary spokesman Daniel Curran.
