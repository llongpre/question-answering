<LEADPARA>  Dry Up; In the "Timing Isn't Everything" category, there's this announcement
from the city of San Jose: "The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Main Library, 180
W. San Carlos Street, has a special collection of documents on flood
insurance, flood protection and flood plan management. This material, provided
by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Administration), is located in the
Reference Department on the third floor . . ." And for the sixth year of
drought they'll offer us plans on ark-building?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     WHAT GOES AROUND -- Paulo V.C. Costa of Brazil, the president of Rotary
International who's visiting the Bay Area this week, stopped by the San Jose
Historical Museum on Thursday where he planted a tree. Plant one here, cut a
rain forest there? Actually, Costa has launched a campaign to have Rotarians
plant more than a million trees worldwide -- but can they do it quickly
enough? . . . Speaking of Rotary, the main San Jose club has launched an
annual award named for Don Goldeen, the late businessman and downtown booster,
honoring the person or persons who did the most for San Jose during the past
12 months. The 1990 winner (no surprise): Tom McEnery.;    SHOW BUSY -- When
the national touring company of "Les Miserables" makes its first stop in San
Jose for a week-long run in June, it'll be bringing one performer home. That's
Jeffra Cook, known to Bay Area audiences for her nightclub singing routine and
roles in CLO's "South Pacific," San Jose Stage Company's "Angry Housewives"
and TheaterWorks' "The Tempest." She joined the tour last year. . . . Network
tube time tonight for another "Housewives" alumnus, Jeff Bryant, who'll pop up
on "Midnight Caller" (10 p.m., Chs. 3, 4, 8). Call it homework. Bryant, a
senior at San Jose State, is finishing work on a theater arts degree. . . .
And Mitty High grad Paul Navarra moves into prime time for the first time
Wednesday with a role on "Doogie Howser, M.D." (9 p.m., Chs. 7, 11, 13). He's
previously been soaping it on "Days of Our Lives.";    DEPT. OF GOOD WORKS --
There were so many people and organizations doing so many good things for the
less fortunate over the holidays that there wasn't space here to commend them
all at the time. But it's never too late to tell you of the efforts of the
employees at Macy's Eastridge, who made gift baskets for kids at the
Children's Shelter; San Jose Jet Center, which helped the American Museum of
Quilts and Textiles gather quilts and goodies for the Family Living Center;
AeroFund Financial, which gave its employees $100 each for a shopping spree at
Toys R Us, with the toys then donated to Toys for Tots; Kim Tompkins and Maria
Teti of Brooks, Stednitz &amp; Rhodes, who turned the CPA firm into a collection
station for the Second Harvest Food Bank; and Apple Computer, XMR, Sun
Microsystems, Network General and a slew of other high-tech companies, which
not only came through with cash but also got their employees personally
involved with helping others. And if I've left anyone out, as I'm sure I have,
you didn't do all those good things for the publicity, right?;    PICTURE THIS
-- Did anyone else besides artist Tony May notice the spread on San Jose in
the current California State Automobile Association magazine, Motorland -- the
one with the photograph of the city's downtown skyline reversed? "A subtle
suggestion of backwardness?" wonders May. "This could continue to fuel local
paranoia -- if we were susceptible to such." But of course we're not, even if
everyone is out to get us.  </TEXT>
