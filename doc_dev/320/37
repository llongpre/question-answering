   Windmere Corp. said it expects to report net income for the fourth quarter of $1 million to $1.5 million, or 11 cents to 16 cents a share. 

   A year earlier, the maker of personal-care products had a net loss of $2.1 million. 
It included charges of $2.5 million related to withdrawal from the rotary-shaver business, the write-down of an investment in a marketable security, and the cost of disposing of a joint venture in Britain. 

   David M. Friedson, Windmere's president and chief executive officer, said the company expects to report sales in the period fell 4% to about $25.1 million from $26.2 million a year earlier, primarily because of the company's withdrawal from the rotary-shaver business. 

   For 1986, Windmere expects to report net income was 55 cents to 60 cents a share, or $5.2 million to $5.7 million. 
It had a net loss of $4.3 million in 1985. 

   Mr. Friedson added that Windmere expects to report 1986 sales rose 5% to about $95.6 million from $91 million in 1985. 

   He attributed the turnaround primarily to expanded profit margins, cost cutting and reduced interest on corporate debt. 
He also tied the improvement to shedding the rotary-shaver business, which cost the company about $6 million in 1985 from inventory write-downs, operating losses and legal fees, but only about $1.5 million in 1986 for legal fees. 

   Windmere is "comfortable" with analysts' projections for 1987 of earnings of 85 cents to 90 cents a share on sales of $110 million to $115 million, Mr. Friedson said. 
It expects strong gains in sales and profits largely from expansion of its beauty-supplies-store division and introduction of two products, expected to add "$6 million to $8 million in new sales and contribute strongly in earnings."
