<HEAD>DEM: Rubber Duckies Belong in Bathtub, Not River</HEAD>

   Rubber duckies are no fun, a Department
of Environmental Management official said Tuesday.
   The DEM outlawed plastic ducks in Rhode Island waterways after a
race in Warwick sent 7,000 toy ducks floating down the Pawtuxet
River.
   The Warwick Rotary Club, which sponsored the contest to call
attention to pollution in the river, charged spectators $3 to enter
a 3-inch pink or yellow plastic duck in a one-mile race.
   ``This is not a good idea for a lot of environmental reasons,''
Stephanie Powell, of the DEM's division of groundwater and
freshwater wetlands, said Tuesday.
   ``If you have thousands of pieces of plastic being dumped into a
river there's no way they're going to be picked up. A lot of these
plastics would end up on the riverbanks, in the marshes.''
   Powell also said the plastic ducks do not break down and could
endanger marine life.
   But Jack Frazier, Rotary Club president, said volunteers picked
up the ducks and all but four or five were accounted for.
   The DEM has not received any complaints, Powell said.
   The race raised $11,500 for the Rotary Club's environmental
fund, which goes to local environmental groups, Rotary officials
said.
   The real lucky duck was Tom Defelice of Warwick, who won a
vacation for four at Disney World in Florida after his duck crossed
the finish line first in 51:15.
