SANTA ROSALIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen single-engine planes from Van Nuys Airport braved thorny cacti and 
federales worried about drug smugglers to land during the Thanksgiving weekend 
at this town's tiny airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in Santa Rosalia -- a convention?" asked a baffled customs 
official at the border in Mexicali as one plane after another filed plans 
Friday to journey 350 miles south down the Baja peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this impoverished little mining town with its rocky beaches is 
hardly a mecca for tourists. Officials said the only group that uses the local 
airstrip is drug smugglers, who occasionally manage to refuel here despite 
attempts by federal police to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
But it is exactly this lack of cachet that makes the village an ideal recipient 
of the clothing, medical supplies and toys the pilots have delivered every 
Thanksgiving weekend for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky we have a harbor here with plenty of fish, otherwise, the poor 
would starve," said Jose Luis Nuno, as he helped the pilots and their families 
unload plastic bags full of cargo Friday evening at the airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
Nuno said the local Rotary Club will sell the hundreds of pounds of clothing to 
the poor for a nominal fee and use the proceeds to assemble baskets filled with 
enough groceries to feed 70 local families for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt, your efforts will be good for the lower classes here," said Dr. 
Miguel A. Montano, Rotary Club president and a hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The annual pilgrimage from Van Nuys Airport is something of an occasion in this 
town of 20,000. At the end of journey, a five-hour trip that requires skill to 
avoid overshooting the one paved runway and landing in the cacti, the 30 
Americans were welcomed with cold beer and pots of fresh ceviche, an appetizer 
of raw yellowtail caught earlier in the day and marinated with spices and lime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a neat feeling to help out directly instead of just giving money to a 
charity," said Ron de Moraes, 43, a television director who lives in Simi 
Valley. "And the Mexican people are so generous to us." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the pilots are volunteer members of a Van Nuys-based squadron 
of the Civil Air Patrol, Moraes and several others joined the entourage after 
seeing signs advertising "Operation Thanksgiving" on bulletin boards at Van 
Nuys Airport. The participants gather donations of clothing, toys and medical 
supplies during the year from friends and fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hagen, a retired medical technician from Malibu, spent much of her spare 
time this past year washing and repairing hundreds of used teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals in preparation for the trip. "I feel like Santa Claus," 
Hagen said Friday as she handed out toys to children at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The relief effort was started in the early 1980s by the Huntington Park Rotary 
Club and adopted by the Van Nuys group a few years later, said Lou Milligan, 
66, a Van Nuys car dealer and the organizer of the trip. The pilots spend about 
$150 per plane for fuel, and most take advantage of the trip south to visit 
nearby resort towns on Sunday, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
The only snag the operation has hit was in 1985 when border guards confiscated 
the group's entire cargo, claiming they were more capable of equitably 
distributing it than the Americans, Milligan said. Since then, the group had 
not been explicit about its purpose when crossing the border, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the visitors attended a buffet dinner the Santa Rosalia Rotary 
Club gives every year in their honor. After sampling more than 20 local 
specialties, including fresh tuna salad and marinated giant squid, the guests 
were given small gifts, such as abalone shells and black coral necklaces carved 
from a nearby reef. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest person in the group this year was 11-year-old Heather Loring of 
Burbank, whose parents brought her to "teach that not everyone lives in the 
same way, but we are all people" said her mother, Carol Loring, a financial 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day in Los Angeles, you come across people in need," Carol Loring said. 
"We try to give at home through our church, but we believe in taking every 
opportunity to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring had a chance to observe daily life in Santa Rosalia during a 
brief tour Nuno conducted Saturday for the visitors. Much of the village, which 
is tucked between a group of arid hills, has dirt roads lined with wooden 
buildings built by the French when they discovered copper here in the 1880s. 
The town's pride and joy is a prefabricated galvanized-iron church designed by 
A. G. Eiffel, who also designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But even at the church, where children met for a catechism class Saturday, the 
town's poverty was evident in the figure of a old man with a cane who 
approached the Americans for money. Later, as the bus left the center of town, 
the visitors could see on the hillsides tin and plywood shacks that Nuno said 
lacked running water. 
</P>
<P>
The town's fortunes, which declined in the early 1980s when the copper ran out, 
have improved lately with the discovery of gypsum, which is exported throughout 
the world for drywall, Nuno said. But at least 10% of the town's residents are 
unemployed, Nuno said, and many of those who work earn only about $3.50 a day, 
enough just to survive in an area where a carton of eggs costs $1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring may be too young to understand the economics of Santa Rosalia, 
but the trip clearly piqued her interest in Mexican culture, her mother said. 
On the way back to the hotel, the girl was practicing the Spanish alphabet with 
one of the pilots.
