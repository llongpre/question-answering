   An Australian company will announce plans to manufacture a compact "two-stroke" engine in Michigan that could revolutionize automobiles in the mid-1990s, state officials said. 

   Details of the project will be announced at a news conference Wednesday morning by Ralph T. Sarich, managing director of Orbital Engine Co. and Gov. James J. Blanchard. 
It isn't known whether the factory will initially make boat engines, automobile engines or both, or who Orbital's manufacturing partner will be. 
Orbital is a Perth, Australia, research concern. 

   At least two marine-engine manufacturers have signed licensing agreements to Orbital's engine, as have General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. Also, Japanese auto makers are understood to be conducting all-out research efforts to adapt two-stroke technology to cars. 
Two-stroke engines deliver power with one up-and-down cycle of a piston, while conventional four-stroke engines require two up-and-down cycles. 

   Two-stroke engines are widely used in lawn mowers, but excess fuel emissions have rendered them unsuitable for use in cars and trucks. 
Orbital, however, claims to have used electronic engine controls to solve that problem.
