   Twenty-five years ago today, AT&amp;T told
Americans to reach out and touch some buttons by introducing
Touch-Tone telephones.
   The invention of the transistor in 1947 led to a 10-year
development period that culminated in the Nov. 18, 1963 announcement
that pushbutton telephone service would begin in two small
Pennsylvania communities, Carnegie and Greensburg, said Bell
Laboratories spokeswoman Maureen Lynch in Short Hills.
   ``We all thought it was pretty great stuff,'' said J.H. Ham, who
supervised the design and marketing of the phones for Bell Labs,
AT&amp;T's research arm. He spoke by Touch-Tone phone from his home in
Indianapolis, where he retired in 1984 after 42 years with AT&amp;T.
   ``We all felt that we were on the forefront of a new service,''
he said Thursday.
   Fifty-five percent of residential phones now are tone dial,
according to industry figures. The rest are rotary or push-button
phones that dial by pulse.
   Creation of the tone dialing system has led to other consumer
technologies.
   Banks, airlines, railroads and other businesses have answering
systems that allow callers to receive information or leave a message
by pressing the appropriate digit. Tone phones also can be used to
retrieve messages from some types of phone answering machines, thus
doing away with separate tone devices.
   Preceding the new services were years of complex research and
testing in areas ranging from the proper type of tone to the
arrangement of the pushbuttons on the phone itself.
   AT&amp;T had experimented with push-button phones since the 1890s,
but the idea was first explored seriously in the early 1950s, and
researchers at Bell Labs developed the equipment from 1958 to 1961,
Ham said. At least two more years were required for final product
development and testing.
   The main development was the ability to send signals _ pitched
tones _ while the connection was being made.
   Design of the phone itself included work by engineers and
psychologists to find the button arrangement that would lead to the
fastest and most accurate dialing.
   A small difference in speed, multiplied countless times over,
takes up more time in the phone network and thus costs more, said
Blake Wattenbarger, the psychologist who supervises the human
factors group at Bell Labs in Holmdel.
   Researchers studied putting the buttons in a circle to mimic the
rotary dial or in an upside-down triangle. They considered two
columns, either with odd on one side and even on the other, or 1-5
on the left and 6-9 and 0 on the right.
   More than a dozen arrangements were tested, until researchers
settled on the present top-to-bottom rectangular arrangement, said
Wattenbarger.
   For the beep to register a digit at a central telephone facility,
a button must be held for at least one-twentieth of a second, he
said. Thus, the buttons had to be designed to make sure the tone
would sound long enough.
   Dialers also were found to prefer being able to hear the tones so
they could know the signals were being transmitted. And the tones
had to be created so that the receiving equipment would not confuse
them with the sound of a human voice, Wattenbarger said.
