<TEXT>     Each park will serve as a rest area where walkers will have refreshments
and some form of entertainment.;    Walkers will meet at Washington Park and
travel to De Anza Park, then to Las Palmas Park, through the Community
Center's grounds and finally wind around back to Washington Park.;    Sixty
percent of the funds from the walker's sponsors will be donated to the
children's hospital, 30 percent will go to the elderly and 10 percent will add
to the club's support fund for other charity organizations.;    Wrist bands,
water bottles and other items have been donated to the walk by the city's Town
Center shopping mall. For information call, Maggie Alsager at (408) 246-8343
