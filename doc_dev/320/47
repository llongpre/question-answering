<LEADPARA>  When Sue Anderson passed her driver's exam 10 years ago, she inherited the
family Mazda. After graduation from college, she bought her family's Saab.
Last year, the 26-year-old graphic designer from Grand Rapids, Mich., bought
her first new car. It was a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse.;    "I never really
considered buying an American car, which is not to say I wouldn't," said
Anderson, who aspires to buy another Saab. "I guess buying a foreign car has
been kind of ingrained in me."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Anderson is part of the auto industry's "lost generation." A new wave of
young drivers are shopping for their first new cars and trucks, and their
biases spell deep trouble for the U.S. auto industry.;    In large part, they
are the children of the drivers who first traded their Fords, Dodges and
Chevrolets in the 1970s for Hondas, Toyotas and BMW's. As they were growing
up, their family cars were typically foreign makes, and they knew mostly
horror stories about Detroit's products. Shaped by their parents' tastes,
these young adults rarely set foot in the Big Three's car dealerships.;    In
the last decade, the U.S. auto industry has invested more than $100 billion to
improve quality, develop new designs and make vehicles more appealing.;   
General Motors Corp.'s $3 billion Saturn project is only the latest example.
But just gaining the attention of what the industry calls "import committed"
buyers is among the most intractable of Detroit's predicaments -- and among
the most critical to reverse.;    "If Detroit is not successful in getting
these buyers back," warned Robert A. Lutz, president of the Chrysler Corp.,
"market share will experience further, gradual erosion.";    Only last month,
Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, appealed to
President Bush to suppress Japanese imports, warning that the weak No. 3
automaker would be "gone" if Japanese automakers continued to gain market
share.;    The sea change in U.S. car-buying attitudes came about even before
foreign models were being offered in significant numbers. Demographers
detected a radical change in buying habits around the time of the Vietnam
War.;    Before the mid-1960s, children frequently embraced the brand of
consumer products, including cars, that their parents used. Adults tended to
be loyal to one brand, and their children followed suit.;    But the
phenomenon of "Chevy families" and "Ford families" faded when children of the
baby boom after World War II reached car-buying age in the '70s. "Baby boomers
had more money and were better educated," said James Kornas, director of
market assessment for G.M.'s Cadillac division. "They also were rejecting
their parents' values.";    One value they rejected was loyalty to their
parents' brands. "They could recognize the value and utility of imports,"
Kornas said. "This was the original BMW and Honda Accord crowd.";    As more
drivers tried foreign models and liked their fuel efficiency, reliability and
comfort, even for smaller models, they spread the word. Good word of mouth,
automotive marketers say, is by far the best advertising.;    The baby boomers
were not particularly loyal to individual import brands, only to the notion of
avoiding domestic models. Even if they loved their Honda, they might be
willing to try a Toyota next.;    Many of the baby boomers' children --
today's car buyers -- have reverted to their parents' buying habits. Consider
the Gribbin family's history of car ownership:;    David J. Gribbin, 51, of
Bethesda, Md., traded his 1978 Mustang II after just one year for a Honda
Accord when the Mustang's transmission burned out, and later motor oil dripped
down a cable and leaked through the dashboard.;    "I bought a second Honda
Accord because I liked the first one," he said. Since his first Honda,
Gribbin's wife, Lori, bought a Nissan Maxima, his daughter, Deborah, inherited
Lori Gribbin's used Nissan, and their son, D.J., traded a Subaru for a Toyota
Corolla.;    "I watched my parents' experience when American cars hit rock
bottom," said D.J. Gribbin, 27, who is a lobbyist in Washington. "It's one
thing for a car to leak oil -- but through the dashboard? Foreign cars might
be more expensive, but the upkeep is less.";    Of course, there have been
foreign-made flops, too. Renault, the French automaker, stumbled in the United
States with its Dauphine in the early '60s and has never had much success
here. Mazda's first cars imported here had faulty rotary engines and other
problems. Even some early Hondas had defects.;    Detroit automakers are
trying to build vehicles that will erase the bitter memories of yesteryear's
Pintos and Volares. The Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus and Chrysler's mini-vans
exemplify models that have demonstrated vastly improved quality and also have
been popular sellers because of innovative design.;    But altering the
perceptions of young buyers like Sue Anderson, who are not familiar with
domestic models and never grew up with them, or the younger Gribbin, who has
wanted little to do with U.S. cars, is proving to be a daunting problem.;   
"A lot of people would have trouble admitting to their peers that they bought
an Oldsmobile even if they thought it was every bit as good as a Honda," said
Chris Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp; Associates, an automotive marketing company in
Agoura Hills.;    Overall, the Big Three's share of the U.S. car market has
dwindled to 67 percent. That statistic, however, does not apply to all age
groups equally. Generally, older drivers prefer domestic makes, while younger
ones, especially in their 20s and 30s, prefer foreign makes.;    According to
a J.D. Power study, 86 percent of the cars bought by people 65 years of age
and older are domestic brands while only 14 percent of the people in that age
group buy foreign makes.;    The shift is more dramatic in the 25-to-34 age
group. There, 56 percent drive domestic models, while about 46 percent drive
cars made by foreign manufacturers.;    Of course, many believe U.S.
automakers are failing to win back import buyers for precisely the reason they
first lost them: Too few of the Big Three's models are competitive in
performance, quality and style. Independent researchers still give the
Japanese models generally higher ratings for quality, value and reliability.;
