<HEAD>Ogden YWCA May Lose Charter For Admitting Men</HEAD>

   The Ogden YWCA has been warned that its
national charter may be revoked and a reprimand issued over its
decision to allow men as full members, the organization's director
says.
   However, Director Gaye Littleton said no sanctions by the
national YWCA in New York would force her organization to reverse
its decision.
   ``We're holding fast on this,'' Littleton said. ``We're not
going to rescind our action.''
   ``I became the first woman member of the Ogden Rotary Club
recently,'' Littleton said. ``Wouldn't it be tacky of me to become
the first woman member of Rotary, then tell members of Rotary they
could not belong to the YWCA because they're men?''
   The chapter's members voted unanimously Feb. 23 to extend full
memberships to men. Littleton said she knows of no other among
several thousand YWCAs to admit men.
   Since then, Littleton has been contacted by national officials
and told ``as soon as they receive the official notice of what
we've done, they will begin official action against us.''
   The national executive director of ther YWCA, Gwendoline Baker,
was the only person at the group's headquarters who could comment
but she was out of the office Friday, said her assistant, Lorraine
Papasavas.
   The pending battle comes nearly a year after a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that Rotary Clubs International could not revoke the
charter of local clubs that complied with state laws by extending
memberships to women.
   Since the Ogden YWCA extended full membership to males, about 30
men have joined, bringing total membership to about 400, Littleton
said.
   The private, non-profit agency has numerous community programs,
including literacy classes, a crisis center for battered women,
treatment centers for abused children and pregnant teens and
support groups for divorced or widowed people.
   ``We have about 300 volunteers in this organization and about 75
of them are men,'' Littleton said. ``We couldn't run this
organization without men.''
   The opposition to male membership is based ``on old fears that
men dominate women, that women will defer to men, and that we will
lose control,'' she said. ``But that's old stuff. Nobody dominates
anybody anymore. We're all working together much better _ men and
women _ and the sexes don't have to be afraid of each other
anymore.''
