Norton Group, the troubled engineering and motorcycle company, has sold,
through its Norton Motors subsidiary, its unmanned air vehicle rotary engine
business to a management buy-out.
The deal, led by Mr David Garside, former director of engineering at Norton
Motors, was effected through a new company, Alvis UAV Engines which is 75
per cent owned by Alvis, the defence contractor. Total consideration
amounted to Pounds 340,000 plus stock at agreed value.
UAV engines are used in target drones and small surveillance vehicles for
obtaining battlefield information. Other uses may extend to border patrols,
counter insurgency and drug interdiction operations.
