   A federal jury on Friday awarded about $100 million
to Windmere Corp. in an antitrust suit charging that the Dutch
company NV Philips had monopolized the rotary shaver market.
   The verdict came in a counterclaim by Windmere against Philips
and its subsidiary North American Philips Co., makers of the
Norelco shaver. Philips had initially filed suit in the case
against Windmere, charging unfair competition.
   The jury cleared Windmere on that charge, accepting the Miami
Lakes company's contention that Philips had attempted to monopolize
the market through predatory pricing in violation of the Sherman
Act.
   ``We're very pleased with the jury's verdict,'' said David
Friedson, president and chief executive officer of Windmere.
``We're going to have a good party.'' .
   The jury awarded Windmere $29.8 million, which is trebled
automatically under the Sherman Act to $89.6 million. The jury also
awarded reasonable attorneys' fees, interests and costs, bringing
the estimated total to more than $100 million, according to
Windmere attorneys.
   ``The rotary shaver war was started by Philips in 1984 as part
of an attempt to drive Windmere out of the rotary business,'' said
Gary Hoffman, an attorney for Windmere.
   ``The $87 million verdict gives Windmere the funds that it needs
to re-enter the markets and provide effective competition against
the Philips companies.''
   Hoffman said Philips controls about 95 percent of the $165
million rotary shaver market.
   Windmere attorney Gary Jones said the appeals process would
likely hold up payment of the award until mid-1991, but he said the
company is confident the jury's verdict would be upheld.
   The case was first filed in Washington, D.C., in 1984, and a
jury found in favor of Windmere on the monopolization issue while a
judge directed a guilty verdict against Windmere in the unfair
competition provision.
   The verdicts were overturned on appeal, however, and retried in
Miami. The decision Friday capped a four-week trial before U.S.
District Judge Stanley Marcus.
   Hoffman, who also represents Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in a similar
suit filed by Philips, said he will ask for a summary judgment
against Philips in that case, based on Friday's verdict.
   Windmere employs about 300 people in Miami Lakes and has 50 to
100 other employees around the country, said Friedson. The
company's manufacturing plants are in China and Hong Kong.
