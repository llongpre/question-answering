   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos' streak
of aviation bad luck continued Friday when a helicopter sent to
fetch him developed engine trouble and made an emergency landing
southeast of Manila.
   An air force spokesman said the helicopter made the unscheduled
landing after the pilot reported unusual vibrations en route to
Laguna province, where Ramos was visiting.
   Ramos' bad luck with aircraft has become almost legendary in the
Philippines.
   In December 1988, his Fokker plane caught fire and burned after
landing on Samar island. There were no injuries.
   A helicopter sent to pick up Ramos the next day crashed into the
sea. The four crewmen were rescued.
   In February, Ramos was stranded for hours at the U.S.-run Subic
Bay naval base after his pilot noticed engine trouble beforing
taking off.
   Two helicopters sent to pick up Ramos also developed engine
trouble en route to Subic and were forced to turn back to Manila.
   In March, Ramos spent his 61st birthday stranded in a rural
military camp near Tacloban after the rotar blade on one of his
helicopters stalled. The aircraft plunged 800 feet before the pilot
regained control.
