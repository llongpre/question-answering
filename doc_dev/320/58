<LEADPARA>  "Remember the legendary Lake Wobegon," asked Bob Moss, "where all the children
are above average? Well, I've found its counterpart here.";    The Palo Alto
resident was referring to Gunn High School Class of '91. Of the 278 graduating
seniors, 113 have a grade-point average of at least 3.5. That's close to 41
percent of the graduating class. Not bad.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Oracle, Gunn's student newspaper, also published a few interesting
tidbits about the students' plans after high school.;    According to the
newspaper, four graduates will go to Princeton, three to Harvard, three to
Yale, two to Columbia, one to Cornell, one to Brown, one to Wellesley, and one
to Smith. By the way, three will attend Stanford, while 23 plan to attend The
Farm's rival across the bay at Berkeley.;    The biggest number of Gunn
graduates, 42, plan to go to nearby Foothill College in Los Altos Hills.;   
There's a surprisingly low number of students going to state universities. One
plans to attend San Jose State, one San Francisco State, one San Diego State.
And four will matriculate at Humboldt State, of all places.;    Three in the
graduating class plan to work and travel, while 13 students have yet to decide
what to do after high school.;    Meanwhile, four students plan to become
soldiers -- one in the U.S. Army, and three in the Israeli army.; WAR AND
REMEMBRANCES: In January of 1968, a teen-ager named Joe Artavia wrote his
sister, Linda Patterson of San Mateo, from the battlefield in Vietnam.
Disheartened by his unit's low morale and the anti-war protests at home,
Artavia suggested that San Mateo adopt his unit, Company A of the 327th
Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. The city council agreed. A few weeks later,
Artavia, 19 years old, was killed in an ambush.;    San Mateo was the only
city in the nation to hold a welcome home parade for returning Vietnam vets in
1972, said John J. Murray Jr., a former San Mateo mayor.;    Now, still
glowing from the victory in the gulf, San Mateo residents are getting ready to
throw a celebration for the latest members of the 101st, who were among the
first to land in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.;    "A love affair
between San Mateo and the 101st has developed over the years," Murray said.;  
 About 100 members of the "Screaming Eagles" are scheduled to arrive at San
Mateo on July 3 from their home base at Fort Campbell, Ky. This will set off
four days of activities, including a parade, a barbecue and an air show -- all
the festivities associated with Independence Day.;    The city also will honor
Vietnam veterans and members of the 143rd Military Police Battalion and the
970th Military Police Company -- the two California National Guard units
headquartered in San Mateo that recently returned from the gulf.;    The
celebration may be San Mateo's biggest Fourth of July bash yet.;    On July 5,
the soldiers will visit the Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno. There,
they will place a wreath on the grave of Sgt. Joe Artavia, a casualty of an
earlier, less popular war.; TV LOG: "The Los Altos Story," a deeply moving
profile of three people with AIDS, will air on the Fox Network on Sunday,
without commercials. Local viewers can see the documentary on KTVU (Ch. 2) at
7 p.m. Those involved with the project probably never thought that "Story"
would receive such wide exposure.;    The documentary originally was made to
educate Rotarians around the world on AIDS. It was started after Los Altos
Rotary Club president Dushan Angius found out that his son, Stephen, had
contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The day filming started,
Stephen's symptoms worsened. The film crew captured the family's grief as
Stephen was taken to the hospital. Stephen died shortly afterward.;    Then
Greg Betts, a Rotarian in Palo Alto, announced that he has AIDS. A few days
later, Walter Singer, known to residents as "Mr. Los Altos," announced that he
too has AIDS. Singer made the announcement at a Rotary luncheon. The film
showed the Rotarians as they turned from shock and disbelief to grief and
sympathy.;    The 30-minute documentary, written and directed by former NBC
news correspondent Robin Young, won the George Peabody Award -- television's
equivalent of a Pulitzer -- and the ACE award, cable television's highest
honor.  </TEXT>
