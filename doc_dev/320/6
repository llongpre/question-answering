   Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. on Thursday unveiled a
new two-seat roadster, a throwback to the 1960s aimed at a part of
the U.S. car market with no competition.
   The M-5 Miata is scheduled to go on sale in Mazda dealerships
nationwide this July. At a base price of less than $14,000, the
Miata is targeting a segment of the car market largely vacated. One
reason is the rising expense of imports, a result of the dollar's
lower value in recent years.
   Honda Motor Corp., another Japanese automaker, said it planned an
introduction of its new two-seat Acura sports car. At a reported
price of $55,000, it's at the other end of the price scale from the
Miata.
   The carmakers disclosed their plans at Chicago's annual auto
show, an important forum for rivals vying for a chunk of the
lucrative U.S. market. Officials from all major manufacturers have
been holding press briefing prior to the show's official opening
Saturday.
   Mazda also unveiled a new version of its RX-7 sports car with a
redeveloped rotary engine that boosts horsepower while improving gas
mileage. The changes also pushed up the RX-7's base sticker price by
about $1,000 to about $17,000, said George McCabe, vice president
for sales and marketing Mazda Motor of America Inc., the automaker's
U.S. arm.
   There are no U.S. or imported two-seat sports cars in Miata's
price range. Mazda officials said Miata, a front-engine, rear-wheel
drive car, was designed specifically for the U.S. market.
   McCabe said the company planned to import about 20,000 Miatas
this year, and boost that to about 40,000 annually after that.
   The two-seat sports car market has been shaky in the U.S. during
the past several years, McCabe said, dropping from 2.4 percent of
the entire car market in 1986 to 1.3 percent last year.
   He said Mazda thinks interest in the car remains, but the rising
prices have made the cars less affordable.
   Among domestic carmakers, Ford officials said Thursday they plan
a newly designed Lincoln Town Car, descriibing it as a rounder
version of the hugely successful top-of-the-line luxury model. They
declined to disclose the cost.
   The Town Car for 1990, which is nearing production, will retain
its traditional interior size and trunk space but it could be longer
than current models despite being built on the same platform, said
Robert Rewey, vice president for sales of Ford's North American
operations.
   Base prices for the 1989 Town Car range from $25,562 to $29,709.
The 1989 Town Car Signature V-8 engine remains for 1990. A new
standard feature is air bags on the driver's and passenger's side of
the front seat.
   Rewey also suggested Ford might produce a successor to the Ford
Escort and the Mercury Tracer. No date was set.
