   The 1989 Ford Probe can be hazardous to drive.
The problem is not with the car, but with other folks who want to
get a good look at it.
   During the time I had a Probe GL test car, I was chased at 80
mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking new-looking Pontiac
Grand Prix who wanted to check out the Probe. Their Grand Prix just
made its debut this model year.
   I also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the
middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my Probe.
Traffic in my neighborhood picked up one Sunday as people came back
around the block to get second and third looks at the Probe.
   And the Probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people
at a Honda dealership I visited.
   It sure seems that Ford has an attention-getter with this
aerodynamic, fun-to-drive, small specialty car that was unveiled in
Chicago in February and went on sale in May. Ford already has
70,000 orders, which amounts to this year's full production at the
Flat Rock, Mich., plant where the car is built. Eventual plant
capacity could reach 150,000 annually.
   The front-drive Probe is unique in a couple ways. Though sold in
Ford showrooms, the car was designed with the help of Mazda Motor
Corp. of Japan and is being produced at the Mazda plant in Flat
Rock by United Auto Workers members.
   The plant, the first U.S. assembly plant operated by a Japanese
automaker to be organized by the UAW, also builds the Mazda version
of the Probe, called the Mazda MX-6 which shares many components
with the Probe.
   Ford, by the way, owns 25 percent of Mazda.
   But the Probe differs from the MX-6 in appearance inside and
out, conveying a more modern, sleek image. And for all the
attention it gets, it doesn't cost a mint. Base price for the GL,
the lowest-priced version of the Probe, was $10,459. The test car,
with optional premium sound system, cast aluminum wheels, air
conditioning and automatic transmission totaled $13,186.
   Ford also offers an upscale LX model which starts at around
$11,400, and a top-of-the-line performance GT, which sports a
spoiler, fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around
$13,600.
   Those prices put the Probe squarely in contention with its
Japanese competitors _ the Honda Prelude, which starts around
$14,000, and the Toyota Celica, which starts around $12,000.
   The test car, the low-end Probe GL, had commendable suspension
and good handling. However, the standard engine _ a 2.2-liter
electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder _ didn't quite seem to
deliver the power one would want in such a sleek, sassy-looking car.
   Cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough. But leg room
in the back was a problem.
   Fit and finish inside and out was admirable, and the tilt
steering was different, causing the whole steering module,
including instrument cluster, to move up and down. It was a nice
touch, considering the feature meant never having to worry about a
steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges.
   It took some getting used to the blinker. It wasn't a stalk on
the side of the steering column. Rather, it was a small lever
attached to the dash.
   Likewise, the headlights were not activated by the traditional
push-pull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a
blinker stalk. Instead, the retractable headlights came out and on
when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned.
   The rear cargo area was deep and roomy, but items had to be
lifted up and over the rear of the car. The Probe is aimed at
young, career-oriented buyers, a Ford statement said.
   Specifically, targeted buyers have a median age of 30, 55
percent are single, half are male, and they have a median annual
income of $33,000, said Ford analyst Ray Windecker. The major
occupations expected to be represented among Probe drivers include
professional-technical workers and managers, he added.
   There have been several reports that the Probe is designed to
replace the Ford Mustang, which has been around since the 1960s.
   Ford says the two cars will be sold side-by-side in showrooms,
and the Mustang will remain as long as there is consumer demand.
   Because the Probe is just arriving on the market, there are no
reliability reports.
