   The 1990 Geo Prizm hatchback is a well-balanced, small family
car. It's eye-catching and stylish outside, but not racy. Its
interior strikes a nice balance _ neither spartan nor opulent. Its
engine and transmission perform smoothly yet you can expect good
fuel economy.
   Most of all, the Prizm, available in sedan and four-door
hatchback models, starts at under $10,000.
   Relatively new to showrooms _ it began arriving early this year
_ the Prizm is the top of the line of the new Geo nameplate that
Chevrolet is giving its dealers to attract more import car buyers.
   The Prizm is the Chevrolet dealers' replacement for the Nova,
that little subcompact praised for its quality but a bit lackluster
in its sales numbers.
   If the stares that the bright red Prizm test car got from
onlookers are any indication, the Prizm might have no trouble
surpassing the Nova. For starters, target buyers are a broad group.
   Chevrolet says they look to attract buyers with median age of 30
who have young families. It also looks for empty nesters with
median age of 45.
   Median household income ranges from $30,000 to $41,000, and 55
percent are likely to be women. About half will be college
graduates. Occupations range from clerical to managerial and
semi-professional, Chevrolet says.
   For these buyers, the Prizm is designed to care for the
practical family in style and comfort, the company says. The Prizm
LSI hatchback test car also had some features that reminded me of
higher-priced cars.
   For example, the rear hatchback styling seemed reminiscent of
the Acura Integra. And the LSI's full center console with cassette
storage was about as roomy as the one on the Mazda 929.
   As expected from the Fremont, Calif., plant where the Prizm is
built jointly by Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. and
where the high-quality Nova also was produced, the test car had
superb fit and finish. Fuel economy was noteworthy. After 100 hard
miles, the needle on the fuel gauge hadn't budged.
   The 1.6-liter, fuel-injected, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine was
teamed with the optional three-speed automatic transmission and
responded reasonably well. It worked up to speed in a smooth,
timely manner. There were no jerks or whines. The dashboard gauges
were large and easy to read. There was plenty of room up front, but
it might be a close fit for three adults in back.
   Legroom in back was fine if the front seats were moved up some,
but knees would be hitting the back of the front seats if those
seats were pushed back all the way. In the LSI, the rear seatback
split and folded down for more cargo space. Be wary of tangling the
rear shoulder belts when pushing the seat back up, however.
   There was some road noise in the test car, but it was not overly
obtrusive. Four-wheel independent suspension helped ease the car
over bumps. One thing I didn't care for was the fact I had to move
the driver seat back to reach the remote fuel filler door lock and
to open the trunk from inside. The levers were difficult to reach
otherwise.
   Since the Prizm is a new car, Consumer Reports magazine has no
reports of owner troubles. Chevrolet said it had no projections for
sales this year.
   Competition is fierce in this market segment. Prizm competitors
include the Nissan Sentra, with a four-door model that starts at
more than $8,800, the Mazda 323, with a four-door model that starts
at more than $8,300, and the Honda Civic sedan, which starts at
more than $9,100.
