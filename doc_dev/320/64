   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Mazda Motor Corp. set the base price of
its new RX-7 sports car at $31,300, 11.2% higher than the
final price of its predecessor.
   Mazda is hoping that the RX-7, with its curvy lines and
powerful engine, will become its "image" car, which helps
explain its high price and Mazda's relatively modest sales
goals for the car. Mazda plans to sell only about 11,000
RX-7s a year. Last year the Japanese auto maker sold 7,000
RX-7s, but that was in the sixth and final year of the old
RX-7's basic design.

   As Mazda officials formally launched the new RX-7 here
yesterday they reached the midpoint in a flurry of new
product launches they hope will give Mazda a new, sportier
image. In the spring, Mazda will launch its new 626 compact
sedan and its MX-6 sporty coupe. Last fall Mazda unveiled its
929 luxury sedan and its MX-3 sporty subcompacts.
   "We have in essence launched a completely new car
company," said Jan Thompson, vice president of Mazda's U.S.
sales and marketing operations.
   The target customer of the new RX-7 will be older, richer
and more likely to be male than in the past. Mazda projects
that 80% of the new RX-7's buyers will be male, up from about
half of the old buyers. Their median age will be 44 years
old, up from 35, and their average annual household income
will be $95,000, up from $59,000 for the prior version. Mazda
officials said the new target market is mostly a function of
the new car's higher price.
   Currently, Mazda is marketing the RX-7 with teaser ads in
magazines aimed at sports-car enthusiasts. Soon Mazda will
expand the teasers to broadcast and mainstream print media.
The car isn't due in dealerships until April 20.
