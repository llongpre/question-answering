<LEADPARA>  Butt Out; The city council had hoped to have a law ready to go this week
making San Jose International Airport a virtual smoke-free area, but now it's
taking a second look. One reason: the increase in foreign tourists, many of
them Japanese on American Airlines' new Tokyo-San Jose flights, who smoke like
crazy. Does a city that long has coveted tourist travel dare appear
inhospitable by thwarting the desires of tobacco-addicted visitors when they
finally do begin arriving? "We're looking at developing designated smoking
areas," says airport spokeswoman Jill O'Brien, rooms sealed off from the rest
of the public where smokers could go to light up. "It's not so much of a
problem at Terminal C (the old, original terminal), where it's easy enough to
just step outside, but at Terminal A (the new terminal used by most foreign
travelers), getting outside is a pretty fair walk." The city attorney's office
is trying to come up with an ordinance that'll satisfy both sides of this
clash between cultures -- the health-conscious puritanism of the Californians
and the anything-blows fatalism of much of the rest of the world.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     SPORTING LIFE -- Organizers of the Cable Car Classic, the annual national
college basketball tournament held at Santa Clara University, have beefed up
their supporting committee with additional heavy hitters, including beverage
baron Mike Fox, auto mogul Don Lucas, home builder Steve Schott, investment
counselor Bob McCullough, entrepreneur/coach Yosh Uchida and well-connected
accountant Henry Yamate. The short-term idea is simply to rally more support
for the local tourney. The long-term goal, though, is to utilize the
committee's clout in setting up a version of the Cable Car Classic in Japan,
capitalizing on the previous success there of such American-bred sports as
baseball and football. . . . A correction: The flashy Acura automobiles leased
by top brass of the San Jose Sharks are Legends, not the NSX models noted here
earlier. One would have thought top sharks would have gone for something of a
more marine nature -- Corvette Stingrays, perhaps -- but the "Legend in their
own time" concept had a stronger allure. . . . It's all relative, of course.
Ed Thomas was driving along Highway 1 near Monterey when he spotted a Maserati
with this message on its license plate frame: "Do My Other Car Really
Matter?";   LOCAL COLOR -- Six elderly people on fixed incomes in Santa Clara
County, lined up by Francisco Garcia of American Savings Bank, will have the
exteriors of their homes painted without charge this weekend by 42 volunteers
from the San Jose office of the Internal Revenue Service, led by Carlos
Camino. No, they won't be painting only in the red or in the black. . . .
There was a considerable painting-the-town-red celebration last weekend
marking the wedding of Christine Cookson, the daughter of Santa Clara Land
Title chief Carl and Sharon Cookson, and Geordie Prodis, son of architect/arts
maven Pierre and Carol Prodis. Rites at the St. Joseph Cathedral, reception at
the Silicon Valley Capital Club. . . . A six-person delegation from Estonia,
in San Jose this month lining up business contacts, will return to its home
town of Parnu with a letter of sponsorship from the San Jose Rotary Club for
Estonia's first Rotary Club. Can't get much more red, white and blue
capitalistic than that.;   TIME OUT -- Poor Steve Paulson of KICU-TV, up late
delivering the Ch. 36 weather, struggled out of bed to be a guest on Mary Liz
Cortese's 6 a.m. talk show on KRTY-FM (95.3) and then saw a power surge knock
that station off the air for the next 45 minutes. If that's the way this week
has gone for you, too, you have my permission to take the weekend off.  </TEXT>
