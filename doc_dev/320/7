   An engineer inspired by the flight of
hummingbirds hovered 40 feet in the air Wednesday in a saucer-like
craft he said will revolutionize commuter travel.
   Paul Moller said his brief, noisy flight over a crowd of
wind-blown reporters was to demonstrate the technology his company
is developing to build a flying car for the 21st century.
   ``At some point in time, it will be used for that,'' Moller
said. ``You know the automobile is still good for that short
distance, but here to San Francisco, here to Reno, here to L.A.,
you're going to see something like this will be in common usage.
   ``It's going to take off very rapidly once the credibility is
established.''
   A former professor and founder of the aeronautics program at the
University of California, Davis, Moller has spent nearly 30 years
developing what's known in the field as a ``vertical take-off and
landing'' or VTOL aircraft.
   His company, Moller International, in a Davis research park
about 80 miles northeast of San Francisco, is working on robotic
aircraft for reconnaissance use by the military, as well as
commuter vehicles.
   Moller, 51, calls his machines ``volantors,'' referring to
quick, nimble flight like that of the hummingbird that awed him
since he was a 6-year-old child.
   The 10-foot wide, round, blue craft he flew Wednesday, the
M200x, hung in the air for about three minutes and made a slow spin
before landing in virtually the same spot where it took off.
   But its visual grace was accompanied with the deafening roar of
eight unmuffled snowmobile engines and a vortex of wind that pushed
it off the ground, slashed the grass below and tumbled camera bags
and the contents of a purse across the lawn.
   Moller wore a fire-retardant racing suit and a motorcycle
helmet. His machine was tethered by a thin cable to a construction
crane for insurance and safety reasons. But once unleashed, he
said, it would go ``as high as I'm willing to let it go.''
   While the M200x looks like a vehicle for George Jetson of
cartoon fame, a another model that Moller said his company will
produce and begin testing later this year is fit for James Bond.
Sleek and bubble-topped, it looks like a cross between a jet
fighter and the Batmobile.
   Moller said his M400 will be able to carry four passengers at
speeds up to 403 mph, as high as 31,000 feet and as far as 850
miles before refueling on low-octane gasoline. At a cruising speed
of 220 mph, he said, its fuel efficiency would be about 15 miles
per gallon.
   Like the saucer craft, the M400 will be powered by eight
gasoline rotary engines built with technology acquired from a
company that used them in snowmobiles. Mollar said he chose rotary
engines for their power, light weight and relatively low cost.
   The engines power fans that drive air down for takeoff and
hovering, then a series of vanes and ducts redirect thrust for
horizontal flight. Computers and gyroscopes control the vehicles'
pitch and roll.
   Moller said the M400 could be ready for sale to the public
within five to 10 years. He estimated the price for initial
hand-built models would be about the same as a helicopter or
airplane, then would drop to $20,000 or $30,000 once mass produced.
   Jack Allison, the company's marketing director, said on-board
computers could navigate the crafts using satellites to determine
their location and avoid collisions.
   ``Eventually we'll have electronic highways in the sky created
so that this type of vehicle can carry commuters in substantial
numbers and do so without any danger whatsoever to commercial
aviation and other general aviation,'' Allison said.
