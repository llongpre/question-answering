<LEADPARA>  Soichiro Honda, the auto mechanic who founded Honda Motor Co., made his name a
synonym for motorcycles and moved on to challenge the auto giants of the
world, died Monday. He was 84.;    His death, from liver failure, brings back
memories of how he and Japan's other "garage" manufacturers led the country's
recovery from the ashes of defeat in World War II.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Honda launched his corporation by attaching recycled war engines to
bicycles.;    An inventor by nature, who often joined workers on the floors of
his factories and research laboratories, Honda developed engines that
transformed the motorcycle into a worldwide means of transportation. He also
helped develop the world's first anti-pollution passenger car engine.;    At
his death, the company that bears his usually mispronounced name -- actually
HONE-dah -- stood as Japan's fourth-largest carmaker, manufacturing 1.9
million automobiles a year. It also is the world's largest producer of
two-wheelers, with 3.4 million motorcycles in its latest fiscal year.
Corporate sales were $30.5 billion.;    Following the Honda's strategy, his
firm was the first Japanese auto company to build factories in its main
market, the United States. This year, Honda is expected to become the third
largest producer of passenger cars in America, displacing Chrysler.;   
Indeed, it was in the United States, not Japan, that the balding engineer with
a razor-sharp temper found his greatest success. Taking on a U.S. industry
that seemed invincible, in the 1970s he won over a generation of young drivers
attracted to the fuel efficiency and low emissions of Honda's CVCC (compound
vortex-controlled combustion) engines.;    Honda's two biggest sellers, the
Civic and the Accord, emerged as the basic family car for millions of
Americans, and in recent years, the company has pushed into the luxury-car
market. Toyota and Nissan, which once thought his U.S. auto plant ideas were
foolhardy, soon followed.;    Although he retired in 1973, Honda's death
stirred an emotional comment from Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda Motor's president.;
   "(He) taught us the challenge of life without compromise and the real
meaning of technology. With a great deal of affection and respect, we called
him 'oyaji-san' (the great father). Words cannot express the sorrow we feel
for his departure," Kawamoto said.;    A maverick in a nation of conformists,
Honda made it a point to wear loud suits and wildly colored shirts. Described
even by Honda executives as a "tyrant in the factory" with "a quick temper
(and) thundering methods of instructing younger workers," he was blunt and
outspoken. He was never invited to join elite business circles.;    In 1967,
Honda entered the passenger car business by coming out with a midget-sized
"family car" called the N360. It had a 40-horsepower engine, a top speed of 81
mph and rode the crest of Japan's late-1960s motorization boom to become an
instant hit.;    In 1972, Honda became the world's first automaker to develop
an engine capable of restraining emissions to the standards specified for 1975
by the U.S. Clean Air Act without the use of a catalytic converter, announcing
the development of the fuel-efficient, stratified-charge CVCC engine.;    The
announcement severely embarrassed Detroit's Big Three, who at the time were
protesting that the Clean Air Act's standards were too strict.;    Born in
1906, Honda was the eldest son of a blacksmith who repaired bicycles. Honda
had only an elementary school education when, in his teens, he left home to
seek his fortune in Tokyo. He was hired by an auto repair company in 1922.;   
In 1937, he established his company, manufacturing piston rings, but found he
lacked a basic knowledge of casting. To obtain it, he enrolled in a technical
high school, applying theories, as he learned them in the class, in his
factory.;    But he did not take exams. Informed that he would not graduate,
Honda commented that a diploma was "worth less than a movie theater ticket. A
ticket guarantees that you can get into the theater. But a diploma doesn't
guarantee that you can make a living.";    World War II brought a boom to his
firm, but when the fighting ended, he sold it to Toyota Motors and took a year
off. He spent it partying with geisha and drinking alcohol that he fermented.;
