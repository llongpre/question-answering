   General Electric Co. will manufacture air conditioner
rotary compressors for Sanyo Electric Co., a Sanyo spokesman
said in Tokyo.
   The rotary compressors, to be produced at GE's Columbia,
Tenn., plant under Sanyo's name and design, will be sold in
North America and other regions except Japan. Production will
begin this fall and will last for five years. The spokesman
declined to specify annual ouput but said it would amount to
"hundreds of thousands" of units.

   He said the move is designed to ease a shortage of
compressors in North America resulting from an abrupt rise in
demand for air conditioners in Japan in the past couple of
years. Sanyo has been supplying compressors to North America
from Singapore, but had to shift some shipments to Japan to
meet increased demand. The spokesman added that the accord is
aimed at promoting international cooperation.
   The two companies also have agreed to exchange technical
information on the development of substitutes for
chlorofluorocarbon, which has been used as a refrigerant in
air conditioners and refrigerators.
