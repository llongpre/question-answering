   If your car is made by American workers in
Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, California, Illinois or
Ohio, that makes it all-American, right?
   Not if it's Japanese.
   More than 1.5 million 1990-model Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas,
Mazdas, Mitsubishis, Subarus and Isuzus will be made in the U.S.A.,
and a new study says the Japanese plants have brought significant
changes to an industry once dominated by Detroit.
   The growing automobile ``transplant'' industry is making it more
difficult to determine the true nationality of cars on the American
road _ or on the Japanese road.
   In Japan, the Ford Probe is made by Mazda, which is partially
owned by Ford, in a Michigan plant, using both American and
Japanese parts. It's sold as an American car.
   To add to the confusion over automobile nationality, you can buy
a Chrysler product made in Japan or a Pontiac or Ford made in South
Korea. And some Japanese transplants are starting to export their
U.S.-made Japanese cars to Japan.
   In a study financed by the import auto industry, researcher
Robert Z. Lawrence said Tuesday that expected growth in direct
foreign investment in U.S. auto manufacturing will create 110,000
jobs and lower the U.S.-Japan trade deficit by between $9.3 billion
and $15.2 billion below what it otherwise would be at the end of
1992.
   Lawrence said assembling foreign cars in the United States
benefits consumers by increasing competition and spreading auto
manufacturing beyond Detroit.
   ``In less than a decade, the U.S. auto industry had been
transformed from a virtually self-contained, highly concentrated
sector with limited competition from imports into an
internationalized industry with Japanese and U.S. producers
competing head to head,'' Lawrence's study said.
   The Commerce Department projects that more than 1.5 million
foreign cars will be made at seven plants in the United States this
year and 2.25 million passenger cars will be imported. New-car
sales are expected to exceed 8.5 million.
   Lawrence, who performed the study while on leave from the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, said he fears the
advantages of U.S. manufacturing may decrease if the value of the
dollar continues to climb in Japan,
   What began as an effort by Japanese automakers to head off U.S.
protective measures against imported vehicles became more
economically viable with the decrease of the dollar's value in
recent years, Lawrence said.
   He cited studies showing that when the dollar dips below 140
yen, automakers can make more by building in the United States than
in Japan, but when it goes above 150, the U.S. operations may
become less viable. The rate on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market
on Tuesday was 159.83 yen to the dollar.
   Complicating the analysis is the fact that some U.S. automakers
have a partial interest in Japanese companies.
   Honda started Japanese assembly of motorcycles in the United
States in the late 1970s and cars in 1981. Today's plants do more
than just assemble Japanese parts, however, Lawrence said.
   Some build engines and other components for export and the trend
is to use more U.S.-built parts, with some Japanese parts companies
also setting up U.S. operations.
   The study notes the following arrangements:
   _Chrysler buys the Conquest, Dodge Colt, Vista and Eagle Summit
from Mitsubishi and markets them as Chrysler products.
   _General Motors markets the GEO Prizm built in partnership with
Toyota in California, the GEO Tracker built in Canada with Suzuki
and the GEO Storm built in Japan.
   _GM's Pontiac LeMans is built by Daewoo Korea.
   _Ford's Festiva is built in South Korea.
   _The Mazda Miata was conceived at a Mazda design faility in
California.
   _Nissan and Ford plan vehicles developed by a Nissan operation
in Ann Arbor, Mich., to be built by Ford in Ohio with parts
supplied by a Nissan plant in Tennessee and to be marketed by both
Nissan and Ford.
   By 1992, Lawrence said, Toyota and Honda are expected to export
50,000 cars each from the United States to Japan. In addition,
20,000 U.S.-built Toyotas will go to Taiwan, which has resisted
increased Japanese imports.
