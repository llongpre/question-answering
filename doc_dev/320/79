   Federal investigators have asked the San
Antonio Housing Authority to account for $4.7 million in
questionable spending and repay $84,260 used to finance such items
as Rotary Club memberships and banquets.
   In a review dated Oct. 3 by the inspector general's office at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, investigators said
there were possible violations of law or conflicts of interest in
several areas, including procurement and contracting practices and
the use of non-profit corporations.
   The report said the agency may have spent $3.8 million alone on
questionable contracts, including goods and services obtained
without competitive bidding.
   The agency may have also overpaid one of its non-profit
corporations at least $255,344 for windows, screens and doors, the
review said. The remainder of the questioned spending included such
items as unsupported payment vouchers and $129,000 in paid sick
leave.
   Apolonio Flores, the housing agency's executive director,
disputed each of the 14 separate allegations. He defended the use
of low-income housing funds for a Rotary membership, the
soliciation of $1,800 in donations from contractors and businesses
for a Hispanic chamber of commerce mixer, and said the non-profit
corporations saved the agency $3 million.
   ``There's nothing we're not prepared to defend,'' Flores said.
He accused HUD investigators of not examining his agency's records
or talking with his staff, although there were seven or eight or
them in San Antonio for about three months.
   The report said two of the agency's non-profit corporations
realized receipts over expenses _ mostly through transactions
between the corporations and federally funded housing programs for
the poor _ but did not pass those savings on to low-income projects.
   As a result, the housing authority ``may not have operated its
housing projects in the manner prescribed by Texas state law and a
conflict of interest may have occured,'' the review said.
   As of Jan. 31, the San Antonio Housing Assistance Corp. had a
balance of $285,922 while the San Antonio Housing Facilities Corp.
had a balance of $1.2 million and investments totaling nearly $4.8
million.
   Under Texas law, the report said, there does not appear to be
any provision for the San Antonio housing authority to maintain
such a fund balance.
   ``Accordingly, the SAHAC might be required to use any excess of
reciepts over expenses soley to make decent, safe and sanitary
housing available for persons of low income,'' the review said.
   The report also said the housing authority, through the San
Antonio Housing Facilities Corp., purchased a private housing
project for $1.13 million that rents to non-low income individuals
and families. Under Texas law, however, a housing authority may
rent or lease housing only to people of low income.
   Of the $84,260 that the inspector general has recommended the
agency be required to repay, $73,857 was charged to federal
programs for such items as banquets, computer hardware and office
furniture for the low-income housing projects, Rotary Club
membership fees, and tax handbooks and publications.
   Another $1,800 was improperly solicited from businesses and
contractors to pay for the chamber mixer in October 1988, the
report said.
   The investigators made their recommendations for action to the
HUD regional administrator in Fort Worth. The authority has 60 days
to respond to the review, while the administrator has six months to
decide how to proceed.
