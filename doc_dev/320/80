<DESCRIPT>  OBITUARY; SAN-JOSE; INVESTMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Anthony Cataldi inherited a chunk of San Jose, and then he sold and bought a
chunk more.;    When the 75-year-old investor died of cancer Tuesday in his
Saratoga home, friends and associates remembered his Berryessa district roots
in a turn-of-the-century fruit ranch, his philanthropic generosity and his
Metro Plaza, an imposing commercial development near San Jose International
Airport.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But, save the old-timers who were in downtown San Jose on the night of Nov.
26, 1933, few were likely to recognize Cataldi as the only man to publicly
acknowledge -- and later deny -- that he participated in one of the most
notorious chapters in San Jose history.;    On that winter night, a mob
lynched Thomas H. Thurmond, 28, and John M. Holmes, 29, in St. James Park.;   
Thurmond and Holmes had confessed to kidnapping Brooke Hart, the 22-year-old
son of the owner of Hart's department store in downtown San Jose, demanding
$40,000 in ransom and then killing him. They said they dumped his body into
San Francisco Bay.;    The two men were in their cells in Santa Clara County
Jail across from the park when the news broke two weeks after the kidnapping
that Hart's body had been found in the bay.;    It was a Sunday. Thousands --
the estimates from news clippings and official sources range from 3,000 to
20,000 -- began to gather downtown as word spread of a possible lynching.;   
Those thousands watched the mob batter down the doors to the jail, and they
watched as Thurmond and Holmes, both San Jose residents, were dragged across
the street -- and hanged.;    But then those thousands, along with all of
official San Jose, entered a conspiracy of silence -- all except Anthony
Cataldi.;    In a first-person account told to a United Press correspondent,
he said:;    "I was the first one of the gang to break into the jail.;    "I
came to town in the afternoon and saw the crowd around the jail and heard that
Brooke Hart's body had been found. I decided to organize a necktie party. I
went out to my father's ranch on Capitol Avenue and got some rope for the
hanging.";    In the balance of a 700-word narrative, Cataldi offered his
story of the lynchings. Two weeks later, he was arrested. A month after that,
he took the stand in court and admitted that he had told his tale to the
United Press but denied he had had any part in the lynchings, including
furnishing the rope. Justice of the Peace Chester Moore dismissed the case,
saying, "I believe the youth had no part in the actual lynching, and
fabricated the story he told newspapermen.";    None of the thousands who
witnessed the lynching ever publicly identified any of the lynchers. None of
the mob ever served any time in jail.;    As California Gov. James Rolph had
said after Thurmond and Holmes confessed: "If they lynch them, I'll pardon the
lynchers.";    Anthony Cataldi was 18 -- a free man with a life to live.;   
He attended San Jose State University and served as a civilian pilot
instructor during World War II.;    As his father, Angelo, aged and was unable
to continue farming the family apricot orchards on the ranch off Capitol, the
younger Cataldi took over management and disposition of the property.;   
Shapell Industries bought and developed some of the land as a 365-house
subdivision with a park site. The city named it Cataldi Park. It stretches for
a half-mile between the Interstate 680-Capitol Avenue interchange and Morrill
Avenue.;    During the 1970s, Anthony Cataldi invested in such Santa Clara
Valley projects as the Allstate Insurance Building on Hamilton Avenue in
Campbell. And he decided to create Metro Plaza on seven-plus acres between
North First Street and Technology Drive across from the Hyatt House and just
east of the airport.;    The project became Cataldi's monument. Metro Plaza is
410,350 square feet of granite, steel and glass, a commercial complex
consisting of three seven-story towers connected on the mezzanine level.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. owns the project and leased the land from
Cataldi and his heirs.;    Some of the 61 tenants are Apple Computer, Seagate
Technology, Control Data and New York Life Insurance. Twelve hundred people
work there.;    Cataldi was no absentee landlord during construction,
according to Marne Michaels of CB Commercial, leasing agents for the complex.;
   The project was completed in 1987, but Cataldi retained an office at the
site. "We could count on him to walk in our office each morning and get a cup
of coffee," said Claudia Benjamin, general manager of Metro Plaza for Tishman
West Companies, the property manager for Metropolitan Life. "This was his
baby.";    Michaels said, "Anthony wanted a high-quality, high-image project."
And that's what he got. Its recognition in 1988 as Office Building of the Year
by the Association of South Bay Brokers was only one of its honors.;    "I
think he wanted to give something back," said Cataldi's friend and fellow
Rotary member, Mel Tuscher, who is a West Valley College math instructor and
former president of the college.;    For Rotarians in the West Valley, Cataldi
began giving back when he joined the service club in 1976.;    He was so
committed to the club's good works and camaraderie that he became known as the
"roving Rotarian," one of the few who held membership in one club in Saratoga
and at the same time was so regular that he was named an honorary member of
the Los Gatos club.;    He was several times a Paul Harris Fellow, recognition
given to donors who fund scholarships named for the man who founded Rotary.;  
 "Anthony was very supportive of that program," said Miles Rankin, a Saratoga
Realtor and former president of Saratoga Rotary.;    For Los Gatos Rotarians,
Cataldi was "a kind of a fixture you grow to like and love," said Roy Mullins,
1990-'91 Los Gatos Rotary president.;    When Cataldi told Benjamin he had
cancer recently, "he had tears in his eyes," she said. "He said he had decided
on chemotherapy even though many people said, 'Why put yourself through all
the pain?' 'Because I have too many things to do,' he said.;    "He was a
fighter," Benjamin said. "He was a person who had things to do in life.";
