<MEMO>  Doer's Profile  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Personal: He and his wife, Renate, have been married 19 years; they have a
15-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter.;   Home: A "rustic" older home on
four acres in Woodside that gets a lot of "hard" use, he says. The stables
outside their front door provide free room and board to eight horses used by
Horse Power, a physical-therapy program for disabled children. And about 15 to
20 children with the 4-H California Carousel program are there every day to
practice competitive riding outdoors and gymnastics indoors in a room they've
converted into a gymnasium.;   Background: During his years with the Campbell
Rotary Club, he has spearheaded projects such as the creation of a mobile eye
hospital in India, which he estimates has saved the vision of 10,000 people,
and a free eye clinic and a drug-rehabilitation program on Indian reservations
in the United States.;   He is now joining forces with several other
physicians in the United States and with the Romanian government to develop a
facility for children with AIDS in that country.;   Working on: Spurred by the
"Third World medical conditions" of people in Santa Clara County who lack
access to health services, he also created Rotacare, a Campbell Rotary
Club-sponsored project. For the past two years, Campbell and a rotating staff
of nurses and office helpers have been providing free medical care to families
in shelters -- one evening a week at Concern for the Poor and another at
Agnews. Because he doesn't leave until everyone's been seen, some nights he's
not finished before midnight, he says.;   By his design, too, are the recently
opened Rotacare clinics at the Arturo Ochoa Migrant Housing Center in Gilroy
and at St. Louise Hospital in Morgan Hill, and a third starting up in January
at a community health center in Fremont. Unlike South County and Fremont,
which have "tons of volunteer physicians," Campbell says he hasn't enjoyed
that kind of response locally. With a few more obstetrician-gynecologists,
pediatricians and family practitioners, he says he will be able to get another
four or five clinics going.;   In addition to other humanitarian projects he
participates in throughout the year with the Rotary, he and his wife give flu
shots at nursing homes and return during the holidays to sing Christmas
carols.;   Hobbies: A regular at the Woodside Library, he also enjoys
horseback riding, tennis and says he can recite poetry from memory for an
hour.;   Hero: "My wife. I care for others to a fault, and she supports the
whole thing.";   Friends like me because: "Just look outside my living room
window," he says, referring to the happy kids on horseback.;   I've learned in
life: "Too often people look at life like they view a float in a parade -- as
a spectator, without ever getting involved. When 70 percent of the patients at
the shelters are less than 4 feet high, there is a need in this county I can't
walk away from."  </TEXT>
