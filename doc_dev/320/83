Norton Motors (1993), the beleaguered British motorcycle manufacturer, has
been given a one-year lifeline by its Canadian backers.
The company, which almost collapsed last month following a row among its
Vancouver-based owners, has been promised a cash injection of at least
CDollars 1m (Pounds 400,000) to restart production at its Midlands plant.
Norton's shareholders - led by Franmar Development Corporation, a Canadian
investment group - agreed the financial package following talks with the
company's UK managers.
Mr Matthew Markham, a Franmar director, said the funds could be used to
build a final batch of 100 motorcycles using Norton's rotary engine
technology. 'If successful, we may invest more money on developing new
piston engine models,' he added.
Fears over the long-term future of Norton rose last month after Ms Rozanda
Skalbania, who had been managing the UK plant, left the company.
If the company survives, Mr Markham said it would consider raising fresh
finance in North America, where Norton BSA - a shell company - could seek a
Nasdaq listing.
