   The 1990 Mazda MX-5 Miata is the best of two worlds _ fun and
affordable.
   That pretty well explains why Road and Track magazine calls it
one of the ``world's best cars'' and Motor Trend magazine calls it
the ``best sports car buy in America.''
   Introduced this summer, the Miata is this year's auto success
story. Dealers have long waiting lists of buyers who seem to just
follow the car-hauling trucks into showroom lots. Some buyers are
putting down deposits just to get a Miata next year.
   The car buff books have splashed the Miata all over their front
covers. And young and old alike seem taken with the little car from
Japan that looks like the low-slung 1960s sports cars from Britain.
   Japanese carmaker Mazda initially projected sales of 20,000
Miatas this calendar year, but demand is so large that spokesman
Fred Aikins said more than 20,000 may be delivered as the company
cranks up production.
   More than 5,800 were sold in the first two months of sales,
Aikins said. Next year, sales of 40,000 more are expected.
   The Miata test car _ with convertible top _ was, well, fun. It
handled nimbly, making tight turns with ease.
   The normally aspirated, 1.6-liter four cylinder engine scooted
the car around with pep, since the Miata body is relatively
lightweight. The five-speed manual transmission is the only one
available at this time and went through its paces well.
   Still, it's no Nissan 300ZX in terms of top speed (116.8 mph for
the Miata vs. a fuel cutoff at 148 mph for the 300ZX) or
acceleration (8.6 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph in the Miata vs.
less than 7 seconds for the 1990 ZX that's powered by a V-6 engine).
   But keeping in mind that the 300ZX starts at $27,300 while the
Miata starts at $13,800 puts things in perspective.
   The Miata interior was your basic black _ the only color offered.
There are three exterior colors: red, white and blue.
   Instrument gauges were easy to read, and there were few
electronic gadgets. Windows roll down manually. Outside mirrors
adjust manually. The seats adjust manually and had a sturdy feel,
thank heavens.
   The suspension is stiff in the Miata, so riders feel lots of
bumps. The AM-FM stereo with cassette player was average.
   I noticed there was considerable road noise in the Miata, but
that seemed to be part of its ``roadster'' charm.
   The steering wheel had an airbag embedded in its center, so the
horn buttons were at the sides. I hit them and sounded the horn a
couple times accidentally.
   Behind the passengers is a small rear shelf. Watch when you put
things there. They tend to slide around and may even come sliding
forward toward you.
   The sun visors are itsy bitsy things that fold in half so they're
out of the way as the convertible top goes up and down.
   The top itself is a breeze to maneuver. Just unzip the rear
plastic window, lay it down flat, unlock the top two sides of the
convertible top in front and down it goes.
   Mazda includes a vinyl padded boot for packing and securing the
convertible top. One problem with the convertible top is that it
prevents you from going to an automatic car wash. Mazda warns
against that in the owner's manual. There is an optional, detachable
hardtop that costs $1,100.
   Another problem with the convertible top is that it has large
side ``pillars'' by the back window which obstruct the view to the
side and rearward. The passenger-side outside mirror helps make up
for that blind spot.
   Fit and finish on the Miata were admirable, inside and out. But
the trunk, with its little spare tire, is pretty tiny. Maybe three
bags of groceries will fit, and that's if you ask them at the store
to fill them no more than three-quarters of the way.
   Mazda expected a pretty even split of single men and women buyers
who have college education. But so far, there are slightly more men
buyers than women, Aikins said.
   Median age was projected to be 32, but Mazda finds plenty of
older buyers, too, he said. Household income of target buyers is
$32,000 a year, he added.
   Because the Miata is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not have owner complaints.
