<F P=106> [Article: "Mr. Zatulin Said What He Said, and the NG </F>
Reporter Did Not Distort Anything"] 
  [Text] On 11 May 1994 NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] published a 
letter by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma 
committee on CIS affairs. In it he accuses NG observer Igor 
Rotar of deliberately distorting his words (5 May 1994). The 
letter was written with a fair amount of emotion, and contains 
no specific examples of distortions of direct speech. 
Nonetheless, in our day when the editors have tape recordings of 
the text, we can state that the text published in NG corresponds 
to the original almost perfectly. Mr. Zatulin himself can 
confirm this by dropping in at the editorial offices. 
  We will also present refutations of those of Mr. Zatulin's 
accusations which, stretching the point, could be called 
concrete. 
  1. "I categorically object to the fact that I. Rotar, who 
acted as guide and interpreter for his Japanese guest at the 
meeting one and one-half months ago, has gathered intelligence 
at my expense, juggling a text that I have never seen." 
  At the start of the conversation Igor Rotar introduced 
himself to Mr. Zatulin as an NG reporter. The chairman of the 
Duma committee also "forgot" that most of the questions were 
asked by the NG reporter, not the Japanese political scientist. 
  The conversation took place in Russian; during the 90 minute 
interview not a single word was spoken in English or Japanese. 
  2. "It might also be noted that the word satellite in modern 
Russian philology has a deprecatory meaning, which the word ally 
does not at all, and the author of the work should certainly be 
aware of this." 
  Here is Mr. Zatulin's exact text: "By this I mean to say, 
with all respect to the current status of these states (the CIS 
countries--NG), many of them, they are doomed either to a very 
close alliance, to the role of satellite, or to extinction." 
  Zatulin: "I leave on his (I. Rotar's) conscience my 
'revelations' of the type: 'A little country should be happy 
when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state,' and 
also the abundance of military field terminology ('conquer,' 
'die,' and so on)." 
  The word "conquer" is found one time in Mr. Zatulin's 
interview in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Zatulin's exact words are: 
"Abkhazia cannot conquer Georgia without someone's support." The 
word "die" also occurs one time, in the chairman of the Duma 
committee's above-cited passage about satellite states. 
  It is true that the phrase, "A little country should be 
happy 
when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state," does 
not occur in that exact wording. But Zatulin did say something 
very close to it in meaning. The exact text is: "I am a 
supporter of empire, if we speak of empire and understand this 
to mean imperial peace...a way of keeping the peace...Their 
coexistence side by side with an empire allows them (the CIS 
republics and republics within Russia) to guarantee somehow, for 
one, the advantages of such coexistence--which means economic 
ties, and for two, enables them to place the concerns of general 
security and defense on the stronger state. As it was for a long 
time in relation to Japan and Western Europe; the United States 
assumed the obligations of defending what they called the free 
world...Because Japan did not spend money on arms the economic 
miracle became possible...ultimately to appear as an economic 
superpower." 
  Yutaka Akino, advisor to the Japanese Government 
(Department of Politics and International Relations) on 
questions of the CIS, and political scientist at Tsukuba 
University, Japan: "About a week ago my Moscow friend, the 
journalist Igor Rotar, telephoned me at home. From my talk with 
Igor I learned that Mr. Zatulin is accusing him of libel, saying 
that the journalist distorted his words terribly in his article 
in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. I was extremely surprised, not least 
because I was with Igor during the conversation with the 
chairman of the State Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties 
with countrymen, but also because we worked together on the text 
of the interview, taking care not to permit any distortion in 
the words of our highly-placed interviewee. 
  "During my trips around the former Soviet Union I was 
already 
accustomed to encountering things that seemed strange and 
unusual to me, a Japanese man. But what happened seems amazing 
to me even in the Russian context: a well-known politician very 
enthusiastically shares his quite unexpected views, then a month 
later has already completely forgotten them. 
  "Incidentally, the interview with Zatulin that I published 
in 
late March in the Japanese magazine SEKAI SHUHO caused a 
sensation among our political scientists: if the Russian 
centrists hold such views, what is there to say about the 
rightists! But the latest unexpected action by Zatulin will 
perhaps surprise my countrymen even more than the originality of 
his political credo."
