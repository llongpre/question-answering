PICKING the star of the London Motor Show depends on your attitude to cars.
Are they a business tool, a mobile extension to the home - or sheer
indulgence?
If an indulgence, there are several on which to feast your eyes at Earl's
Court. One is the AC Ace, a Ford V8-engined convertible which is hand-built
in Surrey a stone's throw from the old Brooklands race track. The Ace is put
forward as a realistic alternative to the class leader among mature
motorists' sports cars, the Mercedes SL.
While the Ace is making its world debut, the DB7 that promises to be the
best Aston Martin for two decades has been seen already at Geneva and
Frankfurt. Powered by a supercharged Jaguar 3.2-litre, in-line, six-cylinder
engine producing 335 horsepower, it is a two-by-two of head-turning
elegance.
An Ace will be around Pounds 50,000; a DB7 - - on sale from next April -
nearer Pounds 80,000. But these are modest prices compared with the Pounds
150,000 Ferrari will ask for its latest offering, the 456GT, when UK
deliveries start early in 1994.
Is Toyota's new, twin-turbocharged, Pounds 37,500, three-litre V6 Supra an
indulgence, too? I suppose so, although this ultra-civilised very high
performer might appeal to a young entrepreneur seeking dashing business
transport.
Worth looking at, if only enviously, are the latest manifestations of the
seemingly everlasting Porsche 911 and the BMW 840Ci coupe. The Porsche, as
always, has an air-cooled, horizontally-opposed six. The BMW is powered by a
four-litre V8 instead of the 850Ci's five-litre V12 and, especially with
automatic transmission, is sheer joy to drive.
All these high-profile, glamorous cars are the icing on the motor show cake.
Of greater personal interest to most visitors are cars that might
realistically grace their garages, or decorate their drives, given an
indulgent employer or understanding bank manager. There are a lot of them at
Earls Court, although not all will be on sale immediately.
Ford's Probe, seen for the first time with right-hand steering and due to
reach Britain early in 1994, is the overdue successor to the Capri. Alhough
Ford-badged, it is built at Mazda's US factory and will be offered with
either a Mazda two-litre, four-cylinder engine or Ford's own 2.5-litre V6. A
pretty car, it competes with the 2.5-litre, V6-engined Vauxhall Calibra.
The Honda Civic coupe, shown first at Frankfurt, is another international
car designed for Europe, made in the US and not even sold in Japan. The
South Korean Kia Mentor 1.6-litre, a neat, power-steered, four-door saloon,
looks most attractive and will be in British showrooms soon, priced keenly
to undersell most of its European and Japanese counterparts.
The new Seat Ibiza, made by Volkswagen's Spanish arm, will soon be in
Britain with three or five doors. Think of it as a cut-price VW Golf
equivalent. Toyota's new three-litre Lexus GS300 (on sale in the UK now at
Pounds 31,950) is a challenger to the Mercedes E-Class and BMW 5-Series.
Mazda's Xedos 9, available in Germany but not due in Britain until early in
the New Year, is related closely to the Xedos 6 but has V6 engines of two or
2.5 litres.
A Volvo saloon or estate with turbo-charging and a top speed of close to 150
mph (240 kph) sounds like a contradiction in terms. But the company thinks
the 850 T-5 will snap at the heels of Pounds 24,000-25,000 cars in the BMW
and Saab Turbo class.
There is a bullish air on the Mercedes-Benz stand where the new C-Class has
pride of place. Last week, Mercedes-Benz UK took orders for nearly 800
vehicles, of which 500 were C-Class. This roomier, curvier replacement for
the best-selling 190 seems bound to become the benchmark for compact
executive saloons. All the engines, including diesels with four and five
cylinders, are multi-valve designs. Prices, starting at Pounds 17,600 for a
1.8-litre C180, are only slightly higher than those of the 190 equivalents.
Also worth a look in this size class is the latest Volkswagen Passat,
face-lifted for 1944 and bristling with safety features, twin air-bags among
them. It is expected to be priced from Pounds 13,000-22,000 when it arrives
in the UK in January.
The first Golf estate, with 25 per cent more luggage space than the
hatchback, and the new Golf Cabriolet are both on show at Earl's Court and
will reach Britain early in 1994.
Can the on/off-road, recreational, four-wheel drive market absorb any more
new models? Toyota clearly thinks so because its 4Runner, with three-litre
petrol or diesel engines, joins the long established Land Cruisers. It looks
as hefty as the Vauxhall Frontera and also shares a pick-up truck's
underpinnings.
Land Rover, meanwhile, is showing the best all-round version of the
Discovery yet: a diesel automatic with a hush pack. This is quiet, has
excelllent fuel economy and is car-like to drive in town.
On Fiat's stand, the Punto - due in Britain next spring - makes its UK
debut.
The London Motor Show at Earl's Court is open daily from 9.30am-7.30pm (9pm
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) and closes on Sunday October 31 at 6pm.
Admission is Pounds 6.50 (Pounds 5 after 5pm) with reductions for children
and pensioners.
