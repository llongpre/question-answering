   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
says Eastern Airlines' rebuilding program is a case of smaller is
better, but that he needlessly provoked ``a united opposition''
from the carrier's three unions.
   In a rare Miami appearance since all three of Eastern's unions
went on strike last March 4, Lorenzo told a Downtown Rotary Club
luncheon crowd Wednesday he should have been ``more sensitive to
the realities the union leaders were dealing with.''
   Lorenzo's remark echoed earlier statements of Eastern officials
that management had underestimated the resolve of the carrier's
pilots. The pilots and Eastern's flight attendants walked off the
job in sympathy when the airline's machinists went out on strike.
   The pilots and flight attendants only returned to work in late
November.
   ``The last year has been a very difficult one,'' Lorenzo told
his audience. ``There have been mistakes, and there have been a lot
of things I know all parties would like to change.
   ``If you look at the last nine months as a battle,'' he said,
``it is a battle no one has won, with the possible tiny exception
of consumers.''
   Arriving for the luncheon, Lorenzo, whose Texas Air bought
Eastern four years ago, walked through rows of striking Machinists
chanting ``choke, Frank, choke'' and warned Rotarians to ``secure
your wallets.''
   Police officers stood guard for the speech.
   Inside, Lorenzo told the Rotarians Eastern losses for the eight
years before he took over the carrier amounted to $1 billion. He
said major changes were needed, but that union leaders were
reluctant to face the needed changes.
   Thousands of dedicated employees, he said, are out of work
because ``they got caught in a system that was no fault of their
own.'' Cutting wages and employees was hard ``from a human point of
view,'' but there was no choice, he said.
   But Lorenzo said Eastern's rebuilding was succeeding since
seeking Chapter 11 protection from creditors shortly after the
strike began.
   ``While the airline that's out there today is not as big as the
airline it was before, I believe very strongly and I believe you
will, too, when you see it that a lot of quality has been
substituted for quantity.''
   Lorenzo said there has been a strong response to Eastern's newly
announced discount fares, starting at $69, and the airline has been
getting good consumer response to its service overall.
   ``We face the '90s with great optimism,'' he said.
   But Frank Ortis, the Machinists union Local 702 president, said
afterward that Lorenzo ``is in big trouble'' as he tries to bring
Eastern out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern is plagued by cancellations and ``their load factors
have been disastrous,'' said Ortis, who was not allowed to attend
the speech. ``It's time for Frank Lorenzo to come to his senses and
sell the airline so we can save it.''
   Ortis said 96 percent of the Machinists are still out on strike.
