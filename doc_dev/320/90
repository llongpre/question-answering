<LEADPARA>  CAR prices aren't quite as ridiculous as we thought they were. A Ford
executive told me recently that if you subtract the cost of the additional
safety features that have been built into automobiles in recent years, the
stickers haven't kept pace with inflation.;   The bottom line, of course, is
that auto prices have continued to escalate, even if they haven't gone up
quite as much as denture adhesive and oat bran. Americans, on average, now pay
more than $16,000 for that fuel-injected payment book they drive home from the
new-car showroom. Similarly, the least expensive models have become markedly
less inexpensive.  </LEADPARA>

OF A SHINY, NEW AUTOMOBILE FOR $7,500 OR LESS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     That the least are now more is apparent in the prices of the entries in
this edition of The Annual Cheap Car Survey.;   When the survey began in 1986,
only cars costing less than $6,000 were admitted to the pantheon. Last year,
we were forced to raise the ceiling to $7,000. For this perusal of the 1992
cheap guys, the ante is $7,500.;   Here they are:;   (box) Suzuki Swift.
$6,899. This is basically a Geo Metro two-door hatchback with an extra
cylinder. That fourth cylinder raises engine displacement to 1.3 liters,
boosts power and lowers gas mileage. The diminished mileage is still pretty
wonderful, however, as EPAs of 39 city and 43 highway might suggest.;   (box)
Ford Festiva L. $6,941. Among other things, the Festiva is an excellent
example of modern multinational auto-parenting. It was styled and engineered
by Ford and its Japanese partner, Mazda, and is assembled in South Korea by a
company called Kia.;   Based on an earlier Mazda 323 platform and powered by a
downsized, 1.3-liter Mazda engine, the stubby Festiva provides lively engine
performance, excellent fuel economy (EPAs of 35 city and 42 highway) and an
exceptional amount of interior room. You can put a 6-foot-3 driver in the
Festiva and comfortably seat someone the same size in the seat behind.;  
Unlike many of the cheapest minicars, which have four-speed manual gearboxes,
the base Festiva has five speeds. It also has one of the best warranties in
its class: four years/50,000 miles bumper to bumper with a $50 deductible.;  
(box) Dodge/Plymouth Colt. $7,302. This is a renamed version of the base
Mitsubishi Mirage ($7,319). Despite the squared-off design utilized to
increase their interior space, these are pretty nice-looking two-door
hatchbacks. They also drive well and get exceptional power from their
92-horsepower engines. The base Mirage earns EPAs of 31 and 36, even though it
only has four gears.;   (box) Toyota Tercel. $6,998. The Tercel was restyled
and mechanically upgraded last year. Now a coupe instead of a hatch, the
cheapest Tercel is good-looking, if somewhat Spartan. It only has four gears,
but its willing 1.5-liter engine still engenders good performance and mileage
(33 city and 37 highway).;   (box) Geo Metro XFi. $6,999. The Metro minicar is
part of Chevrolet's Geo line of small, inexpensive cars built by, or in
concert with, several Japanese automakers. The XFi model is inexpensive to buy
and even cheaper to run. Thanks to its light weight and microscopic 1-liter
engine, the XFi achieves EPA mileage ratings of 53 city and 58 highway, which
make it the nation's most economical car.;   Built for Chevrolet by Suzuki,
the Metro is a two-door hatchback in base XFi form. It is much better-looking
since it got its aerodynamic cosmetic surgery three years ago, and is
reasonably comfortable and roomy by minicar standards.;   (box) Subaru Justy.
$6,645. Like the Festiva, this peppy, relatively roomy minicar comes with a
standard five-speed transaxle in base form. It also boasts an even rarer
cheap-car feature: a fully independent suspension. Thanks largely to that
undercarriage, the Justy rides and handles better than most of the low-budget
boys.;   In its base form, the Justy is equipped with a carburetor instead of
the injection system found on its pricier siblings. This cuts the horsepower
of its offbeat, three-cylinder engine from 73 to 66. But because the car is so
light, it still accelerates decently and provides good mileage (33 city and 37
highway).;   (box) Hyundai Excel. $6,595. A two-door hatchback in its least
expensive form, the Excel is another exercise in mixed parentage. Assembled by
Korea's Hyundai, it features Japanese technology (last-generation Mitsubishi
Mirage mechanicals) and an Italian-designed body. To muddy the water even
more, Hyundai itself re-styled the front end for 1992.;   The Excel is
probably the best-looking of the small cars, but not the most economical. Its
EPAs of 29 and 33, while hardly evidence of gas-guzzling, are rather poor when
compared with those of other cars in its class.;   While this
Johnny-come-lately automaker keeps building cars better, the Excel doesn't
enjoy a reputation for high quality. This is why it gets a much better
warranty this year: three years/36,000 miles bumper to bumper and five
years/60,000 miles on the power train.;   (box) Mitsubishi Precis. $6,579.
This is a renamed Hyundai Excel. Mitsubishi gave Hyundai the Excel technology;
now Hyundai is giving the Japanese manufacturer a cheap car to sell in its
stores.;   (box) Mazda 323 Hatchback. $6,999. Completely reworked two years
ago, this two-door hatch is one of the best-driving econoboxes and an
excellent value. It is solid, roomy and nicely built. Its 1.6-liter, 82-horse
engine delivers good mileage (29 city and 37 highway) and plenty of spunk.
Standard touches include a fully independent suspension, multiport injection,
a five-speed manual transmission and a rear-window defogger.;   (box) Daihatsu
Charade SE. $6,797. The base model is a three-door hatchback with a 1.0-liter,
three-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission. Mileage figures
(38 mpg city and 42 mpg highway) are competitive. The car has reclining front
bucket seats, halogen headlights and dual outside rearview mirrors.  </TEXT>
