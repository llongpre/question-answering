FT  30 JUL 94 / Motoring: A hot hatch

Why have a family hatchback that looks exactly what it is when you could
have one, still with five doors and four seats, that could be taken for
Pounds 30,000-worth of high performance coupe?
That is the rationale behind Mazda's new 323 which goes on sale in Britain
on August 17, priced from Pounds 11,995 upwards.
The launch of the 323 is another sign of Mazda's determination to become the
chief niche marketeer in the world. It knows it will never be a VW or Ford,
Toyota or Fiat in production volume so it is aiming to fill gaps.
Britain is the first European country to get the new 323. For the time
being, there are just three models - a 1.5-litre four-cylinder in GL and GLX
trim and a 2-litre V6 GLX. Three-door hatchback and four-door saloon
versions will follow later in the year when a 1.8-litre engine will also
become available.
There was a lot of design input into the new 323 from Mazda's research and
development facility in Frankfurt, as there had been earlier with the Xedos
6 and 9 models. The result is that the 323 feels a thoroughly European car
with all the finesse one expects of a Japanese product.
Mazda says its objective for the 323 was to combine sportiness with
refinement, individuality with concern for safety and environmental
protection. Don't they all say that nowadays? Of course they do. But, having
sampled 323 fastbacks with both engines, I can confirm their sporty handling
and mechanical refinement. As for their looks, I reckon nothing touches them
in their class.
I first drove the 1.5-litre GLX (Pounds 12,595). The engine, although
smaller than the old 323's 88 horsepower 1.6-litre, is slightly more
muscular, producing a silky 90 horsepower at 5,500rpm. Torque (pulling power
at a given engine speed) is unchanged. The 1.5 GLX rode comfortably and
demanded little gear changing in urban areas, handled nimbly on country
roads and cruised quietly on the motorway.
Delicate controls, effortless power-assisted steering and minimal
road-induced tyre noise made it a most relaxing car to travel in. The
driving position was comfortable although tall people of mature years may
find both front and back seats on the low side for easy entry and,
especially, egress.
I rated the performance and acceleration more than adequate. Mazda claims a
108mph/ 174kph maximum speed and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 11.9
seconds. Fuel consumption should be up to 36mpg (7.85 l/100km) in normal
use.
The 323 V6 I tried next was a hotter property altogether, with 147
horsepower at 6000rpm and wide 50 series tyres on 16in alloy wheels.
It is much more expensive (Pounds 17,495), which puts it into VW Golf V6
territory. Top speed is a claimed 129mph (207kph), with 0-60mph (0-96kph)
acceleration in 9.4 seconds. Only uncharacteristically light-footed owners
should expect to see more than 31mpg (9.1 l/100km).
Naturally, it felt far more eager than the 1.5-litre 323 but - as usual - I
preferred the smaller engined car, which has taller and more resilient 70
series tyres on 13in wheels.
Squat and sporty tyres increase cornering power and make for nervously
responsive steering but they exact a comfort penalty. Although it was fine
on a smooth motorway, the V6's ride was much more knobbly at low speeds and
there was a lot of tyre roar on coarsely textured surfaces.
All 323s have power-operated front windows, mirrors and radio aerial, a
pollen filter and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Driver's and front passenger's
airbags are standard on the 1.5i GLX and 2.0i V6 but not on the 1.5i GL. A
five-speed manual gearbox is standard on all 323s.
Mazda says the boot has class-leading volume but it looked too narrow to
pass my 'two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys' test and has an
exceptionally deep rear sill. Neither of which, I suspect, will do anything
to harm sales of this most glamorous looking hatchback.
