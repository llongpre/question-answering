DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2,500 REWARD PLEDGED IN VANDALISM CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley business leaders pledged a $2,500 reward Monday for information 
about vandalism two weeks ago that left the home of a black family a shambles 
and defaced by racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money may also be used to help the family repair and refurbish 
their home on Niles Street, according to spokesmen who said they represent 90% 
of the city's business community. 
</P>
<P>
"We mainly want to send a signal out that the community is behind this family," 
said Jack Parfitt, president of the Simi Valley Noontime Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
"And that we want these sorts of acts to stop," said Burt von Bieberstein, 
president of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The residents -- Northridge Junior High School teacher Louis Boss, his wife, 
Ontee, and their four children -- discovered the damage Aug. 14 when they 
returned from an out-of-town trip. Every room was ransacked and littered with 
piles of ruined belongings, while the word "skinheads" and racial epithets were 
spray-painted on walls inside the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the investigation had been 
made a priority but that there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's three Rotary clubs each pledged $500, with at least $1,000 to be 
used for a reward. The local Kiwanis Club, meanwhile, promised to match up to 
$1,000 for a reward and also offered to pay the deductible on the family's 
insurance policy.

The Jaycees offered their labor to repair the house.
