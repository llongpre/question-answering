<LEADPARA>  AT THE International Brotherhood of Teamsters headquarters in downtown
Washington, a guard forbids employees driving foreign-made cars to enter the
union's parking garage.;    That is a matter of pride. As of this week, only
cars manufactured in the United States will be permitted in the garage,
according to a directive from General President William McCarthy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But to really have an "All-American" garage, you can't have ordinary guards
screening cars based solely on automobile nameplates.;    These are not your
father's Oldsmobiles. Today's cars are products of a global economy, and a
good auto inspector-rejector needs a more sophisticated eye.;    Here is a
test, developed with assistance from Washington Post automotive columnist
Warren Brown, that will help make any garage pure American.;    Say you're
guarding the Teamsters and you spot a Ford Escort pulling into the driveway.
You admit the Ford because it looks like the right thing to do. The only
problem is that the Ford Escort's engine is made by Mazda.;    You get a
warning. Try again.;    Here comes a Mazda Navaho. You've learned your lesson
from the Escort fiasco and boldly command the Mazda to stop. It sounded like
the right call to make. The only problem is that a version of the Mazda Navaho
is made by Ford.;    You get a second warning. Try again.;    A royal blue
Ford Crown Victoria approaches. That is the car that most of official
Washington drives. You wave it on through, figuring that a union president is
probably being chauffeured inside.;    The only problem is that 27 percent of
the parts used in a Crown Victoria come from places like Germany, Mexico,
Spain and Japan. Any car with a domestic content of less than 75 percent is
considered a foreign car.;    The same goes for that Mercury Grand Marquis
that just slipped through.;    Another boo-boo. Last chance.;    Here comes a
Geo Prizm. You wave it off. Reasonable move. Beneath the body, it's all Toyota
Corolla.;    But guess what? Most Corollas and all Prizms are made at the New
United Motor Manufacturing Co. in Fremont, where production personnel are
United Auto Workers.;    You're fired.;    Of course, it's difficult to
enforce such a rule against foreign-made cars. The venerable UAW tried it a
few years ago at its Solidarity House Headquarters in Detroit and couldn't
make it stick. Besides Corollas, it turns out that the UAW makes Mazdas, too.;
   There are just too many joint ventures, swap deals and foreign sourcing
arrangements to consider. Virtually no American car comes off the assembly
line purely American these days.;    The Chevrolet Beretta gets its five-speed
manual transmission from German design. The Corvette uses Bosch anti-lock
brakes. For the 1993-94 model year, Ford and Nissan will team up to
manufacture a part-domestic, part-foreign minivan. Will the Teamsters leave
half of it hanging out of the garage?;    Maybe you'd let the ever-popular
Dodge Stealth make an entrance. It almost became the Indianapolis 500 pace
car, except that fans questioned the use of a Japanese car to pace the race.; 
  The Stealth, you see, is nothing but a Mitsubishi 3000 GTVR4. The only
difference is the name.;    Check under the hood of a Chrysler and you're as
likely to find a Mitsubishi V-6 engine as anything that Lee Iacocca dreamed
up. Pontiac LeMans has a great American name -- only the car is made by the
Daewoo Motor Co. in South Korea.;    Do you keep out all Hondas? Even those
made in Marysville, Ohio? Do you let in Ford Festivas? They are made by Kia of
South Korea.;    What about Range Rovers? The engines in them are built based
on a General Motors design. The success of the Rovers makes GM look good. The
same is true for Rolls Royce, whose automatic transmission comes from GM.;   
"The ban on foreign cars in our garage was the result of this big hue and cry
among delegates at our convention last month," said Duke Zeller, a spokesman
for the 1.7-million-member Teamsters union. "They felt that we should
encourage the use and purchase of American-made products by American
companies, and we are just setting the example here in Washington.";    Zeller
said he did not know what criteria garage guards were using to enforce the
decree, but he assumed they know what an American-made car looks like.;   
Perhaps. But if a reality test was used as a guide, one thing would be
certain: The Teamsters garage would be nearly empty.  </TEXT>
