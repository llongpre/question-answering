<LEADPARA>  OUTDATED prescription eyeglasses from Fremont and Bay Area residents are
changing the way Filipinos see the world, several thousand people at a time,
thanks to a Fremont optometrist and Rotary clubs.;   Celeste Paz, who owns
optometry offices in Warm Springs and in Daly City, has led a delegation of
about 10 optometrists and ophthalmologist interns from the University of
California, Berkeley to rural villages in the Philippines for the past two
summers, providing eyeglasses to indigents.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Working through the not-for-profit organization, Volunteer Optometric
Services to Humanity (VOSH) of which she is a member, Celeste took her first
trip in 1989 with students and other optometrists. To check eyesight, they
used hand-held equipment in mobile clinics they set up in schools, churches,
town squares and health centers.;   "It's such a humongous task initiating the
eye glass drive over here and fund-raising for student air fares and travel
costs, then compiling, cleaning and determining the power of the prescriptions
of the glasses we receive," says Celeste, who now chairs Project Eyes for the
Philippines.;   "It just takes a lot of patience and organization," she says,
"but the project has gained momentum of its own.";   "Project Eyes for the
Philippines" is just one of four projects sponsored last year by the
California VOSH of which 150 optometrists are members. California optometrists
also made trips into El Salvador and twice into Costa Rica. Nationwide, VOSH
has sent teams into other third world countries, including India and to
African nations.;   For her most recent trip, taken last July, more than 7,000
pairs of glasses were received, including ones sent from Pennsylvania, Nevada
and other areas of California. A primary sponsor was the Bay Area District
Rotary Clubs, including the Warm Springs Rotary Club of which Celeste is a
member.;   Intraocular eye implants were also donated for the most recent trip
that took her to the provences of Quezon, Batangas and Laguna. About 250 of
the people seen in the mobile clinics were referred for cataract surgery of
which only about two people could expect to be selected to have their vision
cleared by ophthalmologists from the Philippines who joined in on segments of
the two-week trip.;   Born in the Philippines, Celeste immigrated to the
United States when she was 15. She studied at the UC-Berkeley, becoming
interested in optometry when she was involved in a research project on
isolating the rods and cones in fish eyes.;   Though her next trip to the
Philippines is more than a year away, scheduled in December 1992 or early
January 1993 to avoid the rainy season, Celeste is already working to collect
glasses. Last night, she was scheduled to address the Fremont Branch of the
American Association of University Women, telling the story of her mission
with a 72-slide presentation, in hopes that they would support the glasses
drive.;   Of the 7,000 glasses donated, only about half could be used. Many
are so scratched they are unusable or the prescriptions are not needed.;  
Celeste and the interns try to match the patient's eye needs as closely as
possible to the prescription glasses available.;   "If not both eyes, we match
to the better eye," Celeste says.;   "It's better for them to see something
clearly than to see nothing at all, to just be in a blurry state. Glasses
relieve some of the load of the eye strain.";   The biggest demand is for
farsighted prescriptions since many of the people who come to the clinics are
elderly. They need glasses to assist them in their basket-weaving,
needlepoint, fish net mending and even in tending field crops. The demand is
seven pairs of farsighted prescriptions for every one pair for the
nearsighted.;   When Celeste thinks back over her three trips to the
Philippines, her mind floods with faces. She remembers the man who was so
farsighted without glasses that he could do virtually nothing, but sit in a
chair. With glasses, he began helping with housework and around the farm.;  
The most memorable, she captured on a slide. It's of a woman in her mid 60s,
her smiling face and wide-eyed expression seeming to say, "Oh, I can see.";  
But Celeste says she remembers, too, the faces of the people who were turned
away. The ones who came but could not find proper glasses or prescriptions.;  
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Anyone interested in donating prescription glasses or
money to fund student air-faires can contact Celeste at 651-3375 or the
A.A.U.W. at 656-8920.  </TEXT>
