BELIZE'S new government is to suspend legislation approving an agreement
between the previous administration and neighbouring Guatemala to settle a
130-year-old territorial dispute. Belize has also asked the Guatemalan
government for a review of the pact.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of the former British colony, said the
aim was to get Guatemala to renounce all claims on Belizean territory. Mr
Esquivel took office a fortnight ago after a narrow general election
victory.
The pact ending the dispute was reached by Mr George Price, Mr Esquivel's
predecessor, and Mr Jorge Serrano, former president of Guatemala.
'Too many concessions were made by the previous government in order to reach
a speedy conclusion of the matter. We will not allow this to happen,' Mr
Esquivel said.
'Our concern, basically, is that Belize has given up rights it has under
Belizean law. We say that it is not for the government alone to make this
decision. Ultimately, it will have to be by a referendum.'
At the heart of the settlement between Mr Price and Mr Serrano are changes
to Belize's maritime boundaries to satisfy Guatemalan desires for access to
the Caribbean Sea. The changes allow Guatemalan ships use of a navigation
channel in the Gulf of Honduras, bordered by Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.
The agreement was ratified by Belizean legislators and Guatemala's
constitutional court.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of the territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize. Two months ago the
UK said it intended to withdraw the garrison. During the election campaign
Mr Esquivel claimed that Mr Price's administration had no plans for the
defence of the country.
Guatemalan conservatives and sections of the military have objected to any
agreement which does not satisfy Belizean territorial claims.
