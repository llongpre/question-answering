  [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of 
the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman 
confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims 
over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion 
on the issue by means of a referendum. 
  During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the 
minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the 
guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected 
to take place during her term as minister and that they are 
prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the 
dispute. 
  As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council 
has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda 
will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the 
Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their 
opinion on the issue. 
  Even though the minister indicated that the Belize Council 
will be directly responsible for negotiating the territorial 
dispute, she also explained that at any given moment it could 
request mediation by the international community, which has 
expressed interest in the problem. 
  In addition, the United Nations will be made aware of the 
objectives sought by the proviso submitted a few months ago. 
  With respect to the extradition of [former President] Jorge 
Serrano Elias, the minister indicated that the court responsible 
for the case has not yet forwarded any [extradition] request to 
the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Belize Council To Be Established in 10 Days </H5>
  The foreign minister stated that the Belize Council will be 
established in no less than 10 days. She also abstained from 
identifying the candidates selected to become members of the 
aforementioned council and indicated that there are still talks 
to be held with some of them in order to confirm their 
disposition to participate. 
  According to the foreign minister, a preliminary list of 
candidates has already been discussed with President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio, and, if there are no objections, she would proceed 
to forward invitations to the citizens named as possible council 
members.
