  [Text] Guatemala City, 19 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez today denied 
reports two military bases had attempted to overthrow President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
  The military chief told NOTIMEX via telephone the country is 
calm, although he admitted there are sectors, which he did not 
identify, interested in destabilizing Guatemala, as part of a 
strategy to affect de Leon' government. 
  Various sources reported this afternoon a group of officers 
discontent with the country's political situation had tried to 
overthrow the former human rights ombudsman, who took power on 6 
June 1993. 
  De Leon, who replaced deposed President Jorge Serrano Elias, 
has faced over the past months a severe political and economic 
crisis, heightened by the violence which claimed the life of 
Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez. 
  Gonzalez, who declared as "unconstitutional" Serrano Elias's 
decision to assume extraordinary powers last 25 May, was gunned 
down on 1 April, dying the following day in a local hospital. 
  The defense minister termed as false rumors of an armed 
uprising within the military ranks, because "Guatemala is on its 
last leg toward peace." 
  "I have contacted some of the 22 military zones in Guatemala 
and have confirmed there is no attempted coup d'etat," he added. 
  "We have confidence and faith in the president, because he 
is 
doing things well, and, although his government is temporary, he 
will set down irreversible bases for lasting peace in this 
country," Enriquez added.
