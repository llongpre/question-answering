GUATEMALA'S Congress has cleared the way for the resolution of a
130-year-old territorial dispute with Britain and Belize, in which Guatemala
was claiming the former British colony with which it has a common border,
writes Canute James.
Guatemalan legislators have ratified a recent ruling by a constitutional
court supporting the decision of President Jorge Serrano to recognise
Belize's political independence and to establish diplomatic ties between the
two countries.
The decision by the Congress is likely to end the dispute, although a
referendum must be held in Belize before the treaty is ratified.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of their territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize.
However, the 78-24 vote by Congress is likely to anger sections of the
Guatemalan military and political right.
