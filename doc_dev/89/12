MR George Price, prime minister of Belize, has called a general election for
June 30, 15 months before it was constitutionally due.
The announcement came a few hours after the resignation of Mr Jorge Serrano
as president of neighbouring Guatemala. He and Mr Price had reached an
accord to end Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim on the former
British colony in Central America.
The Belizean opposition is claiming that the government has no plans to
defend the country against any invasion by Guatemala.
Britain announced last month that it is to withdraw its 1,400-strong
garrison in Belize. British troops had been stationed there to deter
Guatemala from military action to pursue its claim.
Mr Price's People's United party has a comfortable parliamentary majority,
and the election is expected to keep it in power at the expense of the main
opposition United Democratic party.
