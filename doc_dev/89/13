VISITORS arriving at the international airport see an immediate and graphic
illustration of Belize's relations with its neighbours.
On either side of the runway and around the airport are camouflage netting,
anti-aircraft guns, helicopters and fighter aircraft ready for action.
The trappings of the British military garrison in Belize, they represent a
passing phase in the country's foreign policy. The garrison's purpose had
been to deter aggression by Guatemala which had threatened to invade in
pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim.
Now, however, Belize and Guatemala are heading towards a diplomatic solution
of their differences. Belize is also hoping to make friends of other Central
American countries which had backed Guatemala's claim. The role of the
British troops will then change: they are likely to stay for training
purposes.
Belize is both Caribbean and Central American. It sits between two regions
which have been economically, politically and culturally poles apart.
Once the dispute with Guatemala is settled, Belize should be able to act as
an economic and political bridge between its immediate neighbours and the
archipelago to the east.
It is a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) which is
struggling to create a customs union, a monetary union and a common market.
It shares with its antillean neighbours many of the economic difficulties
and uncertainties of small economies. Belize might even become involved in
other efforts at economic integration, such as the emerging common market in
Central America.
Mr George Price, Belize's prime minister, and his predecessor in office, Mr
Manuel Esquivel, have attended summits of the Caribbean Community. Recently,
Mr Price was invited to observe summits of Belize's Latin neighbours.
'Belize is now is a position to do more in Central America because we have
now established diplomatic relations with Guatemala,' says the prime
minister. 'There have been two meetings of Caribbean and Central American
ministers to discuss bananas. Belize has also attended two Central American
summits.'
The West Indian Commission, which has been studying ways of increasing the
level of integration of Caribbean economies, also concluded that Belize can
play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the Caribbean and Central
America.
'A further objective of Caricom policy must be the exploration of possible
levels of economic relationships with the Central American countries,' the
Commission concludes. 'Here, in fact, are the makings of a system of
competition between the two sub-groupings of the Caribbean Basin  .. in
industrial and agricultural exports.'
It says that thanks to its location and its political inclinations Belize is
naturally at the forefront of co-operation between the two regions. But Mr
Esquivel feels that too much is being made of the role which Belize can play
in bringing the Caribbean and Central America closer together.
Belize, he says, cannot be an effective bridge between the two regions
because it has no influence in Central America. 'Because of the Guatemalan
claim we have been ostracised by Central America and we have kept out of
Central American affairs, so we cannot claim any influence in Central
America,' he concludes.
'Our political and economic influence in the Caribbean is minimal as well
because of our geography. Rather than being a bridge, we are desperately
trying to straddle two regions to keep our balance.' There is one very real
and seemingly intractable problem which divides the Caribbean islands and
Central America, and which could determine the value of a friendship with
Belize.
The creation of a single European market in January has put a question mark
over the preferential market for bananas which Belize, the Caribbean islands
and other developing countries have in Europe. The EC is struggling with a
formula which satisfies the desires of the traditional suppliers, such as
Belize, to maintain preferential access, while meeting the demands of the
tendency towards freer international trade, as being demanded by Latin
American producers, including Belize's immediate neighbours.
The disagreement threatens to abort any hopes of meaningful co-operation
between the Caribbean and Central America. Mr Price has attempted to close
the gap on bananas through meetings of government officials and ministers
from the two regions.
Inevitably, there has been effective technical co-operation between Belize
and its Central American neighbours. Matters such as dealing with Latin
America's cholera epidemic, a common approach to the problems of refugees in
the region, and restoration and preservation of Amercan Indian artefacts,
have provided ground for Belize's integration into the region in the wake of
better relations with Guatemala.
Mr Ismael Garcia, Belize's ambassador to Central America, has concluded that
there is now an opportunity for meaningful co-operation in trade and
agriculture. Belize once gained substantially from transhipment of exports
and imports for southern Mexico.
'Belize could prosper from the fact that it is English-speaking and could be
an entrepot such as Panama was,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of
Barclays Bank in Belize. 'This country could, for example, warehouse
material for distribution to Central America. There are opportunities for
Belize to be Europe's gateway to North American Free Trade Area.'
The next stage in Belize's efforts at being a good neighbour, however, will
be determined by others. The Guatemalan government's proposals for resolving
the territorial dispute are being contested in a constitutional court. Much
hangs on the court's decision. Belize's relations with its Central American
neighbours still hinge on its ties with Guatemala.
