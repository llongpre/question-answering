MR Manuel Esquivel, a 53-year-old businessman, is to be sworn in by the
weekend as prime minister of Belize, following a narrow victory by his
United Democratic party in the general election on Wednesday.
Preliminary results yesterday gave the UDP 15 of the 29 seats in the Central
American state's assembly, with 13 for the People's United party of Mr
George Price, the long-serving prime minister. A recount was under way in
one constituency.
The result suggests a miscalculation by Mr Price, who called the election 15
months before it was due. He had hoped to be returned to office on the basis
of steady economic growth in the former British colony. Also, the PUP had
done well in recent by-elections.
In the month-long campaign, however, Mr Esquivel's UDP closed the gap,
arguing that Mr Price's administration was corrupt. He charged the
government with having given Belizean citizenship and voting rights to
thousands of refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador,in a bid to win the election.
Mr Esquivel also proposed free education, from primary school to university,
as well as income tax concessions.
The PUP's loss has raised questions over the political future of Mr Price,
who has dominated the politics of the country of 200,000 people for 40
years, and has been its political leader for all but five years since 1954.
If Mr Price steps down as PUP leader, he is likely to be succeeded by Mr
Said Musa, foreign minister, or Mr Florencio Marn, a former deputy prime
minister.
Mr Esquivel, who was prime minister in 1984-1989, is not expected to bring
any great political changes to Belizean domestic affairs.
During the campaign, however, he accused the Price administration of making
too many concessions to Guatemala in an effort by the government to bury for
good a 130-year-old Guatemalan territorial claim on Belize, which Guatemala
recently declared that it had relinquished.
The opposition leader suggested the suspension of legislation which grants
Guatemala access to the Atlantic Ocean through Belizean territory.
