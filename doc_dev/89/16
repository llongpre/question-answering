THE opposition in Belize has accused the government of having no alternative
plans for the country's defence after British troops leave. Local economists
are also expressing concern about the impact of the pull-out, announced by
the British government last week.
The garrison of 1,400 troops was stationed in the central American country
to deter neighbouring Guatemala, which threatened many times to invade the
former British colony in pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim. The
overall responsibility for defence will pass to the 600-strong Belize
Defence Force.
Britain said it was closing the garrison, but would leave 150 soldiers in
Belize and use the facilities for training. The move follows agreements
between Belize and Guatemala in the past two years which have cleared the
way for a diplomatic end to the dispute.
The contingent is a significant contributor to the Belize economy.
Maintaining the garrison in Belize costs the British government about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. Economists say the country earns Dollars
35m a year (about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product) from the
presence of the garrison.
The government denied it was unprepared for the British decision.
