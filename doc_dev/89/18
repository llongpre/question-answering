  [Text] Henry W. Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala, 
yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations 
on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a 
commission has been created for this purpose and only the final 
details must be settled. 
  The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's 
independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border 
dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope 
will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the 
organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is 
considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan 
Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the 
dispute. 
  Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural, 
and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of 
Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us 
to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson 
said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of 
the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will 
participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. 
  He also referred to the role played by the media in the 
case, 
which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere 
necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala 
and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an 
independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on 
the region's maps, will represent a great step forward.
