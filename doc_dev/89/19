  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday 
acknowledged that there are Guatemalan settlers residing in 
Belizean territory; however, he explained that no pressure has 
ever been exerted on the peasants by Belize to get them to leave 
the area. Land is being sought to transfer them into those 
protected areas, he added. [sentence as published] 
  De Leon Carpio explained that his government's plan is to 
have the families living in the Chiquibul region leave the area, 
because it is a nature reserve. He added that studies are being 
conducted with the authorities of the National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform (INTA) to transfer these people to an area that 
meets their basic living requirements. 
  Nevertheless, he reiterated that Belizean troops are not 
driving these people out, as had previously been reported. He 
also said there is no final deadline for the withdrawal of the 
settlers. 
  "The government is taking all necessary measures for those 
peasants to settle in lands that will enable them to raise their 
crops. It is necessary for them to withdraw from Chiquibul, 
because this is a national park. But certainly, it is not 
because Belize is pressuring them to leave," De Leon Carpio 
noted. 
  In light of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Antonio 
Monzon assured that the Guatemalans will be transferred in 
September to the Dolores municipality in Peten, located several 
kilometers from where they are currently settled. He explained 
that the trip will be sponsored by INTA, the Peten Land 
Committee, and the National Fund for Peace. 
  This issue caused several reactions last week when Carlos 
Asturias, former governor of the northern department of Peten, 
disclosed that Belizean troops had set a 25 June deadline for 
the settlers to withdraw from the area. 
  Asturias recently said the report had been received by a 
parish priest in the region, explaining that a group of soldiers 
who patrol the border area "are threatening them constantly."
