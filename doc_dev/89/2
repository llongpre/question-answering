MR Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize, is to ask Britain for further
assurances of military support if the Central American country is threatened
by neighbouring Guatemala.
Mr Esquivel, who will visit Britain between Sunday and Wednesday of next
week for discussions with government officials, said he was increasingly
concerned at continued instability in Guatemala, where the congress and the
supreme court have rejected a demand from President Ramon de Leon Carpio
that they resign.
'All this could provide an opportunity for those elements in Guatemala which
always want to raise the issue of Guatemalan claims to Belize,' Mr Esquivel
said. 'All this concerns us as it could result in the overturning of former
President Jorge Serrano's recognition of Belize.'
Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim to Belize was ended last year by
a pact between the then-president Serrano and Mr George Price, the former
premier of Belize, in which Guatemala recognised Belize as an independent
nation.
Worries that the Guatemalan military might invade Belize in pursuit of the
territorial claim led to the stationing of a 1,500-strong UK garrison in
Belize. Earlier this year the British government said it intended to
withdraw the garrison, but would use the facilities for military training.
The garrison has contributed significantly to the economy of Belize. Mr
Esquivel said a new budget next month would take account of the impending
loss of income, as well as under-estimated expenditure and overstated
revenue in the previous budget.
