  [Text] The National Council on Belize [Consejo Nacional de 
Belize], CNB, was formally constituted yesterday after President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio signed a decree creating this consultative 
and advisory organization under the Foreign Ministry. 
  Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman will chair the CNB, 
and its members are: Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, Roberto 
Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Carriola, Edwin Fernando 
Guzman Ovalle, Alberto Herrarte Gonzalez, Roberto Herrera 
Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, Oscar 
Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Jorge Skinner 
Klee, and Francisco Villaran Kramer. These 12 individuals will 
be sworn in shortly. 
  The CNB was created by government Decree 259-94 that asserts 
that the territorial difference with Belize and the search for a 
solution that conforms to the Constitution's precepts is a 
matter of national interest. The purpose is to modernize and 
reorganize the CNB as a study, planning, consultative, and 
advisory office of the Foreign Ministry for everything related 
to the territorial disagreement with Belize. 
  According to the decree, the CNB will be authorized to 
appoint permanent or temporary commissions or sub-commissions as 
well as take the necessary measures to regulate their work. The 
decree will take effect when it is published in the official 
daily.
