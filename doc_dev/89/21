  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jan (PL) -- The Belizean Armed 
Forces this year allotted $10 million to strengthen its military 
so it will be prepared to defend national sovereignty, 
government sources disclosed today. 
  This announcement is related to a statement made last 
November by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, who said that the 
imminent withdrawal of British troops from this state would 
probably encourage its Guatemalan neighbors to reclaim this 
territory, a former colony of the United Kingdom until 1983. 
  According to reports received in Mexico, spokesmen for the 
Belizean Government assured that the government is planning to 
gradually increase its troops in response to the withdrawal of 
the British, who defended the country until last 31 December. 
  The withdrawal of 1,200 men and combat equipment, including 
several squadrons of planes of various models, practically 
concluded on 1 January 1994. 
  According to official data, Belize has 1,000 armed men, 
while 
Guatemala has an army of 30,000 soldiers. 
  A representative of the Armed Forces said the objective was 
to add 1,500 men in 1994 and attract more recruits in the 
following years, depending on the state budget, while making 
structural changes in the corps. 
  Diplomatic sources in Belmopan said the internal situation 
was calm, even though Guatemala has on previous occasions tried 
to annex the territory. 
  Julio Roberto Herrera, Guatemalan vice consul in the 
neighboring Mexican city of Chetumal (southern state of Quintana 
Roo), said that from the times of the administration of Jorge 
Serrano Elias, his country has ruled out a military intervention 
in Belize. 
  After pointing out that Guatemala has other priorities, the 
diplomat said: "We respect the sovereignty of Belize, and even 
though we claimed that territory at one time, it doesn't mean we 
are planning an invasion."
