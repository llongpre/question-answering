BELIZE holds a general election today with the ruling party trying to play
down concerns that the country's security is threatened by political
uncertainty in neighbouring Guatemala and a planned pull-out by British
forces.
The election was called by the prime minister, Mr George Price, 15 months
before it was constitutionally due. The election follows the removal from
office of Guatemalan president Mr Jorge Serrano, with whom Mr Price had
reached an accord - yet to be ratified - ending the 130-year-old Guatemalan
claim on Belize.
In a bid to calm fears over Guatemala's attitude to the agreement, Mr
Antonio Castellanos, ambassador to Belize, issued a statement at the weekend
saying that 'the new Guatemalan government will respect and honour all
international agreements.'
Mr Price's People's United Party is expected to retain a majority in the
assembly, but to be closely challenged by main opposition United Democratic
Party led by Mr Manuel Esquivel. The opposition accuses the government of
having no plans to defend the country following last month's British
decision to withdraw a 1,400-strong garrison.
