  [Text] The National Council on Belize, which will be in 
charge of conducting a general and thorough evaluation of the 
dispute over that territory, was officially installed today. 
  An agreement to update and reorganize the National Council 
on 
Belize specifies that the entity will do studies and planning 
and will advise the Foreign Ministry on all matters related to 
the territorial dispute with Belize. 
  The Council will be headed by Foreign Minister Gladys 
Maritza 
Ruiz de Vielman and will be made up of the following persons, 
who will work without compensation: Fernando Andrade Diaz 
Duran, Roberto Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Arriola, Erwin 
Fernando Guzman Ovalle, (Alberto Errarte Gonzalez), Roberto 
Herrera Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, 
Oscar Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Mario 
Quinonez Amezquita, Jorge Skinner Klee, and Francisco Villagran 
Kramer. 
  The 8 June agreement states that the territorial dispute 
with 
Belize and the search for a solution within the framework of the 
Constitution and the principles of international law are matters 
of national interest. The document recognizes the 
appropriateness of the Foreign Ministry receiving the advice of 
qualified citizens who, based on their knowledge and 
capabilities, can help formulate an adequate policy to resolve 
the territorial dispute with Belize.
