   Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel and
former leader George Price conducted a flurry of campagining on the
eve of the nation's general elections Monday.
   All campaigning, including television and radio commercials,
officially ended at midnight Sunday _ seven hours before the polls
open for 11 hours.
   Voters will cast ballots for the 28 seats in the lower house of
the legislature and the party that wins the most seats will name the
prime minister. Terms of office are for five years.
   Esquivel, of the conservative United Democratic Party, said
during the campaign that his administration brought economic
recovery to Belize and efficient government.
   Price, leader of the centrist People's United Party, was defeated
by Esquivel in the 1984 election. His campaign slogan was
``Belizeans first,'' and he accused Esquivel of giving too much to
foreigners to gain investments and tourism.
   Price was the top Belizean official when the country was a
self-governing British colony before it became independent in 1981.
   No public opinion polls were taken but political observers said
they belived Esquivel held a slight edge.
   His party holds 21 seats in the lower house and the United
Democratic Party the remaining seven.
   Elections officials say 82,589 of the country's 160,000 residents
are eligible to vote.
   Initial results are expected about midnight Monday.
   In his criticism of alleged foreign influence, Price attacked a
program that allows foreigners to purchase $25,000 bonds and then
apply for citizenship. If the applicants don't qualify for
citizenship they can redeem the bonds but if they do they can become
citizens and the bond is to be repaid without interest in 10 years.
   The plan is aimed mainly at residents of Hong Kong, a British
colony that is to revert to China in 1997. Many Hong Kong residents
are expected to flee the colony rather than accept control by
communist China.
   Esquivel has said that during the past five years prices for
sugar, fruits and other major exports have been stable and foreign
investments and tourism have doubled.
   Belize has a bicameral legislature with an elected House of
Representatives and appointed Senate. The house determines which
party will form a new government.
   Belize, smaller than Connecticut, is on the Central American
mainland but maintains closer cultural ties with other
English-speaking former British colonies in the Caribbean than with
its Spanish-speaking neighbors.
   Neighboring Guatemala maintains a territorial claim against
Belize, formerly British Honduras, and British troops are stationed
in the country in case of hostilities with Guatemala.
