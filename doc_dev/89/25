  [Text] Human Rights Ombudsman Dr. Jorge Mario Garcia 
Laguardia requested the Army's and the Foreign Ministry's 
intervention to protect the nation's territorial integrity and 
the lives of Guatemalans settled along the Belizean border. 
During his visit to the region, the ombudsman personally 
learned about the threats that Belizean soldiers issued against 
35 families who live at the border town of Rio Blanco, Dolores, 
Peten Department. The high-ranking official met with peasants 
of the aforementioned town and the mayor of Dolores who gave a 
detailed account of the threats issued by the Belizean military. 
  Sebastian Tux, a peasant, asked the ombudsman to clearly 
demarcate the boundary with Belize, because last year Belizean 
soldiers also forced them to abandon their land, where they left 
behind a crop of approximately 2,500 quintals of beans and 2,000 
quintals of corn. He added: If necessary we, the peasants, 
offer our labor to build a boundary along the border. We have 
looked for another place to relocate, but have not found one. 
He said they would rather stay than emigrate from the lands 
they have tilled for many years. 
  Moreover, Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia said it all began when 
former President Jorge Serrano accepted Belize's independence 
and established diplomatic relations with its government, an 
unconstitutional act that would have never been accepted by the 
Guatemalans if a referendum had been held on the issue. 
  However, he added, two key institutions have to intervene: 
the Army and the Foreign Ministry. Besides, the Armed Forces 
are duty bound to maintain strict control of the border, which 
it has apparently neglected; and the Foreign Ministry has to 
mediate with the Belizean Government through diplomatic channels 
to prevent these actions. Referring to this, he asked the Army 
to permanently protect the border zone and guarantee Guatemalan 
rights; and he asked the Foreign Ministry to mediate 
diplomatically to put an end to hostilities and provide 
guarantees to the Guatemalan citizens, so they may live in their 
country and exercise their rights.
