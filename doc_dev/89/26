Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean
territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the
two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston.
The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter
sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former
British colony would come only with a final treaty.
