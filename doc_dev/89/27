  [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Government and Army today rejected the "ultimatum" given by the 
Belizean authorities to 18 Guatemalan families who have been 
ordered to withdraw from lands they are occupying. 
  According to the Belizean Embassy, the peasants, who have 
established themselves in the "Chiquibul" national park, have 
been given 15 days to clear the area with a deadline that 
expires on 10 March. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said Guatemala does 
not acknowledge the Belizean Government's authority to give 
alleged "ultimatums" to Guatemalan families living in border 
areas. 
  Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez 
asserted that the Army will not tolerate any "meddling" on 
Belize's part in Guatemala's national sovereignty, much less the 
"intimidation" of Guatemalan citizens. 
  Enriquez added that the Belizean authorities are "being 
unreasonable" and that they cannot set deadlines for families to 
abandon the area in question because Guatemala still disputes 
ownership of that territory. 
  Belize gained its independence from Great Britain in 
September 1981, and the administration of deposed Guatemalan 
President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993) recognized it as a state. 
However, Guatemala has maintained its claim on the region for 
over a century and a half. 
  The defense minister said the Army is prepared to support 
the 
Guatemalan families living in the "Chiquibul" national park, 
where they have built their homes. Enriquez dismissed the 
possibility of clashes with Belizean soldiers.
