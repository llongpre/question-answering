FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (3): A dominating personality - Politics

FOR MORE than 40 years, the politics of Belize has been dominated by one man
and one party. Mr George Price helped to form the People's United Party in
1949. This move - a response to the devaluation of the British Honduras
dollar which hit the pockets of Belizeans - established an anti-colonialist
party which the British originally viewed with suspicion.
This suspicion lifted over the next 15 years, and Belize would undoubtedly
have claimed full independence in the 1960s were it not for the Guatemalan
claim over Belize. In 1964, the country became self-governing, except for
foreign policy, defence and internal security. Full independence was gained
on September 21, 1981.
The PUP won the six general elections held from 1954 to 1979, losing to the
opposition United Democratic Party in 1984. Against the odds, it narrowly
won the 1989 general election - with a narrow 15-13 majority in the House of
Representatives. Its majority was strengthened after one opposition deputy
switched to the government benches.
Unmarried, austere and a devout Catholic, Mr Price, 73, is seen as likely to
fight the next election, which must be held by 1994. The prime minister, the
last of the generation of post-independence commonwealth leaders, has no
obvious successor within the party. Those seen as most likely to succeed him
are Mr Said Musa, foreign minister, and Mr Florencio Marin.
Although the party rhetoric would suggest otherwise, the policies of the two
main parties have proved hard to distinguish. Although ostensibly more
populist than the pro-market UDP, the PUP in government has followed similar
policies in favour of privatisation and continued investment.
This has calmed the disquiet among investors following the 1989 election
which the PUP won by appealing to nationalist sentiment with the slogan
'Belizeans first' and charges that the UDP had allowed foreign speculators
to dominate the economy. The US embassy's assessment of the investment
climate in the country remains 'excellent'.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, the UDP leader and former prime minister, agrees the
'PUP were more effective in fighting the election than we were'.
Since the election the opposition has split over the aimed-for settlement
with Guatemala, which Mr Esquivel's party has supported. A faction, led by
Mr Philip Goldson, a respected senior politician, has ceded from the UDP and
formed a new party, the National Alliance for Belizean Rights.
Mr Esquivel says his party sacrificed 'party integrity in favour of national
integrity' in supporting the government over the Guatemalan settlement. 'We
felt this was an opportunity to end this problem once and for all by making
a minor concession to solve a major problem.'
This may add to his problems in fighting the municipal elections in March.
But he says that in the the long run the UDP will not be hurt, since the
NABR is a one-issue party.
