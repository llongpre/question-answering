   A Guatemalan gunboat fired a shot after a British
naval vessel refused its order to halt off the Central American
country of Belize, the Foreign Office said today.
   A spokesman said the government will bring up Sunday's incident
with the Guatemalan authorities, but he could not say whether a
protest would be filed.
   ``We'll have it taken up with them. What form that will take,
frankly I don't know,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. ``We'll have to talk with them first.''
   He said the HMS Fawn, an 800-ton inshore survey vessel, was in
the territorial waters of Belize when the Guatemalan gunboat ordered
it to stop.
   When the Fawn ignored the order, the gunboat fired a shot. Two
Royal Air Force Harrier jet fighters flew to the area, and the
Guatemalans agreed to withdraw their ship after telephone contact
with British authorities, said the official.
   Belize, a former British colony, gained independence in 1981 but
requested British troops to remain until a territorial dispute with
neighboring Guatemala is resolved. About 2,000 British troops are
stationed in Belize.
