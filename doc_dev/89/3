  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Dec (AFP) -- The UK Embassy in 
Guatemala today confirmed that the Belizean Government will 
assume responsibility for its own defense as of 1 January 1994, 
and announced that it had started the "immediate" withdrawal of 
the UK troops stationed in that country located in the Central 
American isthmus. 
  Lourdes Taylor, the UK Embassy's cultural attache, asserted 
that the process will be completed by September 1994. She 
added, however, that a small UK military detachment would remain 
in Belize to operate a jungle training installation. "This 
action (the troop withdrawal) reflects the UK Government's trust 
in the much-improved relations between Guatemala and Belize and 
the determination of the governments of both countries to 
resolve their bilateral differences peacefully," Taylor asserted. 
  The official's statements alluded to Guatemala's historic 
claims to Belizean territory. The tone of those claims eased 
after former Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano recognized 
Belizean independence in 1991. 
  AFP talked on the phone to the spokesperson of Prime 
Minister 
Manuel Esquivel in Belmopan, and he explained that the UK troop 
withdrawal will be a gradual process, which was planned over the 
past seven months. It will be "a change of style in UK 
assistance" to Belize, Carlos Perdomo, who is Esquivel's private 
secretary, asserted. The official added that after the 
approximately 1,800 soldiers leave Belizean territory, the UK 
will maintain 100 military advisers to operate a special 
training school and that a changing number of UK soldiers will 
come to be trained at that school. 
  Last week, Prime Minister Esquivel stated that the frequent 
raids by Guatemalan soldiers on Belizean territory could be "a 
bad sign" and indicative of a possible invasion. Guatemalan 
authorities denied this possibility. Perdomo disclosed that 
there is no "immediate" fear that the Guatemalan Army will take 
advantage of the UK troop withdrawal to take their demands by 
force. 
  The prime minister's statements, explained his secretary, 
were triggered by the fact that Guatemalan opposition sectors 
have insisted on disavowing all the actions taken by former 
President Serrano, including his agreements with Belize, and 
declared them as unconstitutional. "If an opposition government 
sets in, it is possible that it will act differently from 
Presidents Serrano and (current President) De Leon Carpio have 
acted. This was the reason for the prime minister's 
statements," he added. 
  Belize obtained its independence from the UK in 1981, but UK 
troops have remained on the territory as guarantors of its 
territorial integrity. Ten years later, when it recognized 
Belizean independence, Guatemala renounced a large part of its 
demands for the territory of the young nation. It, however, 
maintains its intentions to negotiate a passage to the Caribbean 
sea through the Belizean Province of Toledo. Guatemala already 
has access to the sea in the extreme southeastern part of its 
territory. Negotiations for the opening can only be initiated 
when the recognition of Belizean independence is ratified by a 
referendum in Guatemala.
