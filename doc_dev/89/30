WHILE civil war ravaged the rest of central America in the 1980s, Belize
remained an oasis of calm. As heavy debt and economic crisis engulfed Latin
America, Belize achieved high growth and single-digit inflation. In a zone
with a history of military regimes and political instability, Belize offered
democracy and respect for the rule of law.
Belizeans are proud of what differentiates them from their neighbours; but
their destiny will probably lie as much with the Hispanic countries
surrounding them as it does with their traditional allies in the
English-speaking Caribbean.
Belize is becoming, ethnically at least, more like its neighbours. An
estimated 40,000 people - a fifth of the population - have arrived from
neighbouring states over the past decade, fugitives from civil war or
economic deprivation. The influence of the creoles - the Afro-European group
that has traditionally dominated Belizean society - has meanwhile weakened
because of emigration.
This has caused tension: the newcomers have provided the manpower for
agriculture, the engine for growth in the 1980s. But they have put pressure
on health services and schools.
The prime minister, Mr George Price, who with his People's United Party has
dominated Belizean politics for 40 years, has spoken of the country as a
bridge between central America and the Caribbean. This is a long way from
reality, but it is part of a growing recognition among the mini-states of
the two sub-regions of the costs of isolation.
Until last year, practical co-operation with the rest of central America was
impossible because of Guatemala's claim over the territory of Belize. The
claim delayed independence of Belize - known until 1973 as British Honduras
 -until 1981 and was the reason for Britain's maintenance of a garrison of
1,800 men and a squadron of Harrier jets.
Following guidelines hammered out between the two sides, Guatemala last year
recognised Belize's independence. A final settlement will require further
steps, including ratification in a referendum in Belize and concessions to
guarantee Guatemala access through the Gulf of Honduras to the Caribbean.
These moves have allowed a lifting of the veto on Belize's membership of the
Organisation of American States, to which it acceded in January 1991. Belize
will also join the InterAmerican Development Bank in November.
The garrison still provides 8-10 per cent of the country's GDP, but its
departure will not necessarily mean an end to the British military presence.
As a training ground, Belize's jungle terrain is excellent.
A withdrawal would anyway have less economic impact now than in the past
thanks in large part to the growth of agriculture. Agriculture and
agro-processing account for a quarter of GDP, 40 per cent of employment and
nearly 70 per cent of exports. However, four-fifths of all Belize's exports
benefit from preferential market arrangements, some of which are threatened.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Belize exports to EC markets at low tariffs
under the Lome convention. Its agricultural products also have tariff-free
access to the US under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the country
also belongs to the Caribbean common market, Caricom.
The North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico is
one threat. It may encourage Mexico to become a big citrus producer. A
further extension of US free trade agreements to other countries in Latin
America, proposed under President George Bush's Enterprise for Americas
Initiative, would also erode the special position of CBI countries.
According to Mr Ralph Fonseca, minister of state in the ministry of finance:
'The main tenet of our trade policy has been gradualism. We are saying give
us to the year 2000 and we can take on anybody.'
This approach recognises the country's still heavy dependence on a few
export products and its chronic trade deficits. Remittances from overseas -
estimated to bring in USDollars 15m to Dollars 17m a year - help balance
this. So does tourism, which has grown to become the country's second most
important source of foreign exchange.
Tourist attractions - rain forest, long expanses of coral reef and important
Mayan sites - have potential for further development. Belize has, however,
neither the desire, the labour force nor the beaches necessary to become a
mass tourist destination.
The country also provides a positive reception for foreign investment. There
are constraints such as a small labour force and mixed infrastructure: good
telephones but poor roads and no access for large ships. Electricity is
costly: 21 US cents per kilowatt-hour, almost three times that of the US.
It can also offer stability. Government handovers of power in 1984 and 1989
were achieved without big shifts in policy. The Belize dollar has been fixed
since 1976 at two to the US dollar and inflation has been low. The
government is fairly free of corruption. According to one businessman: 'The
worst thing you can say is that occasionally it favours its friends.'
However, the bureaucracy is often slow. One businessman describes it as
'expert in procrastination' and Mr Fonseca says the government recognises a
need to modernise it.
The government is also selling commercial assets. The telephone company has
been privatised, although the government retains a significant stake, and
plans to sell the electricity company are being finalised. The privatisation
programme has critics. Mr Manuel Esquivel, leader of the opposition, says
that it risks being dominated by one company: Belize Holdings, controlled by
Mr Michael Ashcroft, the controversial chairman of the British car auction
and security group, ADT.
The government has also attempted to speed up development by increasing
capital spending. This and its pay award to public sector workers of an
annual 10 per cent for the next three years have increased anxieties that
the government is forgetting its traditional fiscal conservatism.
Mr Keith Arnold, the central bank president, is worried that the
government's revenues are falling behind its spending: 'The government has
sufficient funds for the next two to three years, but beyond that it will
have to take care.'
This will accelerate talk of fiscal reform. Although legislation has been
passed to enable imposition of a value added tax, the government has been
reluctant to implement it. Yet the tax system is outdated: most revenue is
raised through taxing international trade.
The government also faces growing social problems. As migrants put pressure
on health and education services, emigration to the US is tearing at the
social fabric. Into this environment, cocaine has found its way. Belize has
resolved one drugs problem - in the 1980s it was one of the top five
suppliers of marijuana to the US; now most of the plantations have been
eradicated. But it has developed another: on a line between Colombia and the
US, Belize is used for cocaine trans-shipment. The Belizean middle men are
paid in kind and they have seen to it that a cocaine habit has developed. As
a result, crime, particularly in Belize City, is on the increase.
Yet, in spite of these problems, it is possible to be optimistic about the
future. With per capita income of USDollars 2,000 a year and a reasonable
income distribution, Belize is a richer and more just society than many of
its neighbours. Its institutions - its judicial, political and educational
systems - work reasonably well. As Mr Geoffrey Hart, manager of Barclays
Bank in Belize, says: 'This country is not going to be a Singapore. It's no
tiger but it has a lot going for it.'
