<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman reported 
yesterday on her participation in the 11th Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] Ministerial Conference held recently in Cairo, Egypt. She 
explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting 
inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of 
support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, 
thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute. 
  Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to 
safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM 
Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon 
Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which 
had not been achieved at this forum previously. She asserted 
that the government agreed with the NAM statement because 
Guatemala's position had not been omitted. To the benefit of 
both parties, the declaration backed the negotiations and, by 
not polarizing the situation, established the necessary climate 
for it, she added. 
  She highlighted as special achievements her participation as 
vice president of the conference and Colombia's selection to 
chair the next NAM presidential summit of member countries to be 
held in 1998. Above all, we managed to get a special 
pronouncement in favor of Guatemala -- something that is 
uncommon -- to support the efforts being made by De Leon Carpio 
to further the democratization and peace processes, she 
emphasized. 
  On ending, Vielman stated that the officials who attended 
the 
NAM Ministerial Conference had attempted to redefine the 
movement's role in the new international context and had 
reaffirmed its objective of furthering the developing countries' 
struggle to advance. 
  The meeting was attended by 130 delegates, of which 109 were 
from member countries. We took advantage of this situation and 
held bilateral meetings with most of the representatives at the 
meeting, she added.
