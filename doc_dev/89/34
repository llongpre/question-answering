  [Text] Belize City, Nov 25, CANA -- Belize and Mexico this 
week signed a memorandum of understanding on health. The 
memorandum relates to medical emergencies and high-complexity 
illnesses. 
  The memorandum was signed at the start of a meeting of 
health 
officials from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. The memorandum 
states that the general hospital in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, 
Mexico will be made available to Belizeans who need emergency 
medical care. 
  Under the agreement, the health care for medical emegencies 
and high complexity pathologies to persons referred by the 
Belize Ministry of Health will be delivered according to the 
physical capacity of the general hospital. 
  Belizean patients, the memorandum stated, will be charged 
according to their socioeconomic capacity and will be 
responsible for costs and expenses incurred for lodging and 
boarding while being treated in Chetumal. Persons unable to pay 
for the medical attention would still have access to the 
treatment and the Mexican Governmnt would take on full 
responsibility for the payment of the treatment. 
  The Belizean and Mexican health officials agreed that if a 
Belizean patient cannot be attended at Chetumal's general 
hospital, he will be referred to other health facilities in the 
state of Quintana Roo or other hospitals in Mexico. 
  Speaking at the start of the meeting, Belize's prime 
minister, Manuel Esquivel, said his government's health policy 
recognises health as a basic human right and a fundamental part 
of the development process. 
  "The policy accepts that it is government's responsibility 
to 
ensure that every Belizean has access to the best level of 
health care available, appropriate for his or her health needs, 
regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status. and 
political or geographic distinctions," Esquivel said.
