  [Text] It has been confirmed on-site that Guatemalan Army 
troops have been sent to the Peten-Belize border area where 
Belizean soldiers and civilians are harassing the Guatemalans 
who live there. 
  The small town of Rio Blanco in Dolores, Peten Department, 
is 
the one most seriously affected by these actions. The homes of 
the residents -- who are mostly Quekchi Indians from Alta 
Verapaz -- have been burned by the invaders. This situation is 
nothing new in this village that was settled 15 years ago. The 
pressure by Belizean troops, however, began nine years ago. 
According to Salvador Jimenez, a man from Jalapa who has been 
living in this village for 15 years, a black woman came to this 
village several weeks ago and threatened to leave them with 
nothing during the corn harvest. 
  Francisco Javier Chen, a young Quekchi Indian who is a 
community leader, added that the Belizean soldiers have told 
them they are inside Belizean territory and that if they remain 
there their homes, crops, and even their lives are at stake. 
  The village, on the banks of the crystal-clear waters of the 
Blanco River and a little further out than Chiquibul, seems to 
be like the garden of Eden. There is abundant agricultural 
production, the weather is very nice, and the river waters are 
fresh. One can hear the cry of the Saraguate monkeys in the 
distance. 
  Speaking in Quekchi, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez 
Morales held a lengthy conversation with the residents of the 
Rio Blanco village in Dolores, Peten, who complained of the 
actions by the soldiers from Belize. Guatemalan peasants 
wearing ragged shirts and rubber boots came down nearby paths, 
as well as women who were wearing the native outfit from Alta 
Verapaz and adolescents who wore colorful necklaces and carried 
sweaty children. 
  Likewise, sweaty soldiers walked down the same paths. They 
were wearing dirty camouflage uniforms because they have been in 
the area for a long time. Some of them carried light artillery 
weapons. Others carried M-16 rifles, while another carried radio 
equipment. 
  Enriquez, speaking in their language, urged the peasants to 
respect the law and not cross the border. "The Army is here to 
give you a helping hand. If for any reason you have to abandon 
the area, the government will find land to give you," he said. 
  The peasants said that they "harm no one and work in their 
fields." On some occasions they said they have found tombs, but 
they never touch them. They always leave them where they are. 
They complained that the Belizean soldiers accuse them of 
"opening the Maya tombs, but this is not true." 
  The dialogue between Enriquez and the community leader was 
interrupted several times when 10 persons speaking at the same 
time explained that they "are Guatemalans and they hope their 
government will do something for them at this time -- the worst 
of their lives -- because there has never been anything like 
this before in the jungle." 
  The troops from Military Zone No. 23, stationed in Santa 
Elena but with jurisdiction in Peten Department, are arriving at 
the border area between this department and Belize.
