<F P=106> [News conference by Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez </F>
with unidentified reporters on the agreement reached by the 
Guatemalan Government and the General Command of the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, to create the Commission for 
Historical Clarification, CEH; place and date not given; 
broadcast in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Enriquez] ...a historical event. As President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio visited -- I believe -- the Roosevelt 
Hospital, he was asked the same question. I believe my reply 
will be the same. I must tell you that the Guatemalan 
Government's political resolve is shown once more. Reaching a 
full and lasting peace is our objective. We believe the work 
done by the government's peace delegation in Oslo was excellent. 
I congratulated them for their almost 15 days of hard work. I 
can tell you from experience that this type of work is 
exhausting. However, this work was not completed in vain, 
because we took two more steps toward achieving the peace we all 
desire. 
  [Reporter] Is the Army satisfied with the agreement reached 
by the government and Army representatives? 
  [Enriquez] I do not think any military members disagree with 
accepting and signing certain agreements. What we are doing 
here has national resonance, and those things that could affect 
the Army have institutional resonance. I refuse to believe 
someone will place his personal interests above national and 
general interests. As I said earlier, this situation does not 
prevail in the Army. Of course, there may be someone who is 
unsatisfied because it was once said that the Army would never 
hold talks with armed groups. This was even said at Esquipulas 
II. However, the Guatemalan Army is an institution that always 
respects the Army General Commander's mandates. On that 
occasion, it was said that there were going to be talks with 
subversives, and we held talks with them. There are even Army 
members currently holding talks with subversives. From the 
institutional and my personal point of view, I can tell you that 
the two agreements are good enough to lead to reconciliation and 
peace in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Have the objectives of the Guatemalan armed 
conflict been accomplished by creating this commission? You 
said on repeated occasions that there would not be an avenging 
commission? Could you.... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] ....I believe you are completely 
right. We always said, even when I was a member of the Peace 
Commission, that the CEH [Commission for Historical 
Clarification], which was initially called the Truth Commission, 
did not intend to seek revenge. Its goal was to learn what 
really happened to ensure that new generations will not make the 
same mistakes and to prevent Guatemalan society from becoming 
polarized to the extreme of starting to kill each other again. 
These last 34 years have been very painful years of mourning, 
death, deception, and polarization. It has been a very long 
night for Guatemala; we now believe a dawn is coming for 
Guatemala. The CEH meets the equanimity, justice, and 
impartiality requirements, but, above all, the commission seeks 
no revenge. This is why the cases will not be handled 
individually, but collectively. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what can be concluded from a number 
of recommendations made by General Victor Manuel Argueta 
Villalta? 
  [Enriquez] In reference to what? 
  [Reporter] In reference to his statement that those sectors 
that wanted to question him legally lacked moral authority. 
  [Enriquez] I think the Guatemalan Army, as a legitimate 
armed 
group established to defend the State, fulfilled completely its 
constitutional duties during these 34 years. All Guatemalans 
must be proud of the Guatemalan Army because thanks to this 
Army, this legendary Army with high morale but very poor 
resources, Marxist-Leninism was not established in Guatemala. 
  If it were not for the Guatemalan Army, we would now be 
regretting the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Guatemala. 
Because of the Guatemalan Army, we have a better Guatemala. It 
is not as developed as it could have been if the subversives had 
not undermined progress in Guatemala. However, we anticipate a 
better Guatemala. We must all recognize that there is poverty 
in the country, and we must work to achieve better standards of 
living for all people. We, Guatemalans, must work to achieve 
this goal. We cannot sit around and wait for money and 
happiness to come from the heavens. We must all work harder and 
with greater integrity, tolerance, and understanding to attain a 
happy society in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, changing the subject, the human 
rights ombudsman has requested that the Army defend the 
sovereignty of Guatemala, which is being challenged by Belize. 
Will you do this? 
  [Enriquez] That is our duty. We will fulfill our 
obligations, but we also know Belizean reality and the reality 
of what is currently taking place. I know this reality first 
hand because I have traveled there, and if necessary, I will go 
there again. 
  There is no problem between Belize and Guatemala at this 
time. There are no definite borders; there is [word indistinct] 
between El Peten and Belize. This situation will have to be 
defined according to the recommendations made by this newly 
installed Belize Council, as stated by the foreign minister and 
the president. This Council will conduct a study and will make 
recommendations to the president on a referendum or popular 
consultation to end this territorial claim of Guatemala, which 
is recognized by Belize, England, and the world. 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, what will the Guatemalan Army do about 
the threat from Belizeans to expel Guatemalans, whom you had a 
chance to visit, from the neighboring area? Is there Guatemalan 
Army presence there? 
  [Enriquez] We have soldiers there; there are also soldiers 
from the Belizean Army. We have talked to the Guatemalans 
residing there. They have not been forced to leave the area. 
We coordinated efforts with the INTA [National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform] president. The commander of Military Zone No. 
23 is aware of these efforts, and he was instructed to assist 
these people. But they will not be removed from the area. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct]? 
  [Enriquez] This cannot be done. That could create a more 
serious conflict in the area. 
  [Reporter] What will happen if the Belizean Army wants to 
expel these Guatemalans? This is our concern. 
  [Enriquez] My answer to that is the following: The chief of 
the Belizean Army spoke to [name indistinct] Rodriguez, and he 
told him that they were not interested in evicting these 
Guatemalans. He said that they should leave once they obtain 
land, that they will be offered transportation to move to their 
own land, and that they will not be moved from one place to the 
other. They will leave that area, which is an ecologically 
protected area. There is a Maya cemetery in the area. 
  [Reporter] In the meantime, you will not allow that they 
be... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] Listen, our main duty is to protect 
our fellow citizens, and we will give our lives for our fellow 
citizens. You can rest assured of this. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, going back to the Truth Commission 
issue, people's sectors have expressed violence could increase 
while [words indistinct] is approved. What is the opinion of 
the Army? 
  [Enriquez] Well, the accords for the creation of the 
Commission were already approved and signed. 
  [Reporter] Yes, but these groups fear violence may increase 
before the Truth Commission begins operating. 
  [Enriquez] I know this Commission will begin working 
immediately after the final accord is signed.
