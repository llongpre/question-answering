The British government said yesterday it would begin pulling its troops out
of Belize this weekend, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
The UK, which announced last May that it would end its 45-year military
presence in the former British colony, has about 1,350 troops there. By the
end of next September all but 50 will be gone, the government said in a
statement issued by the British embassy in Guatemala City. Those remaining
will run a jungle training school for British troops.
British troops have been stationed in Belize to counter possible aggression
from Guatemala, which claimed the country as its own until recognising
Belize's sovereignty in 1991. A border dispute continues but the British
government said the pull-out reflected confidence in improved relations
between the two countries.
