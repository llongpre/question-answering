  [Text] Melchor de Mencos, Peten -- As Belizean Prime 
Minister Manuel Esquivel broadens his anti-Guatemala campaign, 
Army troops of that former colony are patrolling the border area 
and warning Peten families not to enter their territory. 
  More than 3,000 Belizean soldiers are maintaining permanent 
surveillance along the alleged [supuesta] borderline. In fact, 
they built a wide highway that allows them to move easily from 
Cayo San Ignacio to Corozal, which is near the area that borders 
Peten. 
  It was reported that soldiers from the former colony 
frequently enter Peten territory and that they even harass 
peasants who have lived and worked there for many years. 
  Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel has started an 
anti-Guatemalan 
campaign and ordered the expulsion of numerous families with 
years of residence in the territories under dispute although 
many of them already filed requests before the immigration 
authorities to reside legally in Belize. 
  In order to win support within the Belizean community, 
Esquivel maintains a hostile attitude toward Guatemalans and 
points out that there could be an invasion anytime. 
  In a recent meeting with Queen of England Elizabeth II, 
Esquivel advised the sovereign on the need to maintain English 
troops in the former colony, but his efforts were unsuccessful. 
The monarch, however, assured him that the British will use the 
Belizean jungle as a training ground for some soldiers. 
  Peten authorities in Melchor de Mencos said that Guatemala 
maintains minimal surveillance along the border and this could 
facilitate new incursions by Belizean soldiers. They added that 
more than 3,000 Guatemalans have been expelled since Esquivel 
became Belizean president, although his grandparents hail from 
San Miguel, a town across from the Island of Flores. Esquivel 
also admitted that he has relatives residing in Santa Elena (a 
Peten community) but has never met them. The authorities noted 
that his hostile attitude toward Guatemalans is inexplicable.
