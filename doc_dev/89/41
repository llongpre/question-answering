  [Text] After it was confirmed that Belizean troops had 
entered Guatemalan territory, yesterday, Army spokesperson Major 
Edith Vargas de Marroquin reported that the Army is prepared to 
defend the country militarily. Nevertheless, Vargas said this 
problem must first be solved politically and that the Guatemalan 
Foreign Ministry has started to take specific actions to this 
end. "The defense minister visited the area and listened to the 
local residents' complaints and fears. He told them the Army is 
prepared to defend them, as it is its responsibility," she said. 
  According to the Army's official version, the problem is 
that 
there is no definite border between Guatemala and Belize. This 
has not led to an armed confrontation between the two armies, 
however, the source said. Maj. Vargas reported that the 
Guatemalan and Belizean troops stationed along the border area 
hold "peaceful" relations and avoid incidents. 
  It has been reported from Peten that combined British and 
Belizean troops continue to harass and intimidate hundreds of 
peasant families living in the area. The source added that 
these two armies have used sophisticated equipment, such as the 
Harrier plane, specially designed for heavy fighting. 
  On Tuesday, the peasants intimidated by these actions 
presented to the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office a petition 
reporting that foreign troops had entered their communities to 
evict them and seize their property. Sebastian Tux, leader of 
the affected communities, told this newspaper that Belizean 
soldiers arrived at their homes and ordered them to leave 
because the territory belonged to Belize.
