  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Belizean troops 
have raided Guatemalan territory, demanding peasants from this 
country abandon their lands in the northern border areas, local 
Guatemalan authorities charged today. 
  "The soldiers gave us a 15-day deadline to fall back; or 
otherwise suffer the consequences," said Carlos Ovando, mayor of 
the Guatemalan hamlet of Los Dolores in northern Peten 
Department. The official told the Guatemalan Congress that 
Belizean soldiers threatened to kill the peasants in the area if 
they remain in the border region. Ovando asked for the 
Guatemalan Government's intervention to exercise greater control 
along the border in light of what he labeled a Belizean invasion. 
  Last year in October, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry 
confirmed that Belizean soldiers had raided Guatemalan territory 
on several occasions; however, the Belizean Government ruled out 
an "erosion" of diplomatic relations. On 16 February, residents 
of the De Melchor de Mencos municipality in Peten, approximately 
10 km north of here, charged that soldiers from the neighboring 
nation had entered Guatemalan territory, destroying maiz and 
rice fields. 
  Guatemala maintains -- since the time Belize was a British 
colony -- a demand on this territory that gained its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1971.
