  [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said Central America will 
present joint proposals at the Fourth Ibero-American summit. 
The proposals will deal with sustained development, ecological 
defense, and the review of the Cuban and Haitian cases. 
  The Central American countries "are taking a joint proposal 
on the urgent need to form an alliance for sustained development 
in the region and ecological defense, which we hope the rest of 
the Ibero-American nations will join," De Leon Carpio said. 
  The president traveled to San Jose, Costa Rica, at 1430 
[2030 
GMT] to meet with his Central American counterparts to adopt a 
united position on these topics. De Leon expressed optimism 
about the positive results of the Ibero-American Summit to be 
held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June. 
  He added that the meeting of government leaders from Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and 
Panama, which begins today and ends tomorrow in San Jose, has 
the primary objective of establishing a "common front" for the 
defense of the region's interests. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Ministry sources told NOTIMEX that during 
the Cartagena summit the presidents will sign a document on the 
importance that greater trade integration has for the 
hemisphere's economies. A diplomat indicated that during the 
Ibero-American Summit the Central American presidents want to 
meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera to discuss a free trade agreement 
between those two countries and Central America. [passage 
omitted] 
  De Leon also said the Central American presidents will 
propose the review of the current crises in Haiti and Cuba. The 
Guatemalan president said that in Cuba's case, the island's 
return to the OAS must be conditioned on respect for human 
rights. 
  The president expressed concerned over the Haitian 
situation, 
indicating that the current economic blockade has been 
insufficient to restore a democratic regime and that, in 
addition, the threat of a military invasion is looming over 
Haiti. The violence in the Haitian capital due to the 
international sanctions against General Raoul Cedras' regime 
"greatly worries us, and we must seek effective solutions," De 
Leon added.
