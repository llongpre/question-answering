It's not exactly a cargo cult, but William Branigan of the Washington Post 
reports that residents of the Central American country of Belize are going 
bonkers for the Chicago Cubs: 
</P>
<P>
"Through a quirk of geography and satellite technology, Belize has more Cub 
fans per capita than any place outside greater Chicago, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"It started in 1981, when local businessman Arthur Hoare introduced television 
to Belize (population 180,000), the only English-speaking country in Central 
America. Many Belizeans already had television sets by then, but used them to 
watch rented videotapes. The enterprising Hoare capitalized on the ready market 
by launching Channel 9, which captured Chicago's WGN station on a satellite 
dish and relayed it to local viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Then aren't the broadcasts pirated? 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. broadcasters consider the Belize market so small that trying to stop the 
operations would not be worth the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
According to Branigan, Belizeans take the view that, as one resident put it, 
"Out of the sky we get sunshine, we get rain and we get TV signals. Whatever 
drops out of the sky is an act of God."

Crying wolf: Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, once known for his quick wit, has 
developed a new image -- that of a hand-wringing poor-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
After his top-ranked Irish had defeated Michigan State Saturday, Holtz moaned 
about Notre Dame's next opponent, Purdue. It was his understanding, Holtz said, 
that the Boilermakers had beaten Notre Dame whenever the Irish were reigning 
national champions. Sorry, Lou, no sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC radio's Jim Healy, based on research by sports expert Dwain Esper, 
informed his audience Monday night that in nine seasons after Notre Dame 
championships, Purdue has won three times, the Irish have won three and three 
times the teams didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Sept. 27, 1936, what future Dodger manager played in his only 
major league game? 
</P>
<P>
Strictly business: The Boston Red Sox unceremoniously made it clear Monday that 
former stars Jim Rice, 36, and Bob Stanley, 34, won't be in Red Sox uniforms 
next year. Both are in final years of long-term contracts that included club 
options for 1990. Rice earns $2.34 million for this season, Stanley $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the Red Sox plan to do with the money they save on the contracts, 
General Manager Lou Gorman told Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant: "A lot 
of it will go to Mr. Esasky, if we can sign him." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Nick Esasky will become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Walter Alston, as a late-inning substitute at first base for 
Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals. Alston made one error in two chances 
and struck out in his only time at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, on the possibility of the 
club's winning the National League East title while playing in Montreal: 
'There's something un-American about clinching a pennant in a foreign country."
