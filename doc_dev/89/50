  [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan 
will change his itinerary and visit the Bahamas after winding up 
his trip in Honduras Friday [28 January], Jason Hu, 
director-general of the Government Information Office, said 
Thursday. 
  Lien originally planned to leave Tegucigalpa Friday and 
return home via San Francisco. 
  The Bahamas, however, had been keen to have Lien visit while 
he was in Latin America, and so Lien agreed to a one-day 
stopover, according to Chang Ping-nan, the ROC ambassador to the 
Bahamas. 
  Lien and his 17-member entourage attended the inauguration 
of 
new Honduran President Carlo Roberto Reina on Thursday. The 
ceremony was held at Tegucigalpa National Stadium and lasted 
four hours. 
  Lien later met with Nicaraguan President Violeta de 
Chamorro. 
He greeted Chamorro on behalf of President Li Teng-hui and 
expressed his appreciation for Nicaragua's support of the ROC in 
the international community. 
  Nicaragua and six other Latin American countries submitted a 
letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali, 
asking that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the 
General Assembly in September. The request was later voted 
downed. 
  Chamorro said that she was honored to be able to speak up 
for 
the ROC in the international community and said she would 
continue to do so. She also invited Li and Lien to visit 
Nicaragua. 
  Lien also met briefly with Belize President Manuel Esquival 
and Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Esquival 
expressed the hope that relations between Belize and the ROC 
could be cemented. He also said that Belize's vice premier and 
foreign minister will visit the ROC soon.
