   Continental Airlines announced Monday it will
have access to each of the seven Central American countries with
its inaugural nonstop service to Nicaragua from Houston's
Intercontinental Airport.
   The nonstop service to Managua, Nicaragua, is scheduled to begin
July 1.
   ``Houston's new international terminal to open in May provides
the perfect focal point for our Central American service,'' said
Mickey Foret, Continental's president. ``The addition of the
Nicaragua route brings all of Central America into our growing
global air system.''
   Continental currently offers nonstop service from Houston to
Guatemala City, Guatemala; San Salvador, El Salvador; and Belize
City, Belize, with continuing service to San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
   The airline plans to start nonstop service to Panama City,
Panama, with continuing service to San Jose, Costa Rica, on May 15,
the first day of operations at the new international terminal in
Houston.
   Houston-based Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., is
the largest U.S. carrier to Mexico, with service to eight cities.
In May it will be the largest U.S. carrier to Central America.
