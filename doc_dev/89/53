FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to seek Belize statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is to demand a statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, about reports that Britain is poised to withdraw the garrison of
up to 2,000 troops in Belize to help provide peace-keeping troops in the
former Yugoslavia.
Shadow defence minister Mr George Foulkes said such a move would be 'an
outrageous thing to do in this volatile part of the world'. He said it could
have been avoided 'if the government had taken our advice to suspend all the
Army cuts that had been announced'.
