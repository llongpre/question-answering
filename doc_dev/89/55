  [Text] The Army has reiterated it opposes the creation of a 
truth commission, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales 
has stated. The ranking officer said, "I would like to banish 
the topic altogether, although it may be debated in the future." 
  Enriquez Morales, who is accompanying the president on a 
visit to Mexico, said that, despite the imminent signing of an 
overall agreement on human rights, the question of creating a 
truth commission is dubious because it would depend on what is 
to be decided in the next round of negotiations. 
  The Army's position remains unchanged; it cannot accept the 
creation of the truth commission for reasons already explained. 
According to the defense minister, the accord on human rights is 
wide-ranging and is not limited to this issue. In addition, 
General Enriquez Morales announced Guatemalan troops were 
deployed along the border with Belize to protect 20 families 
that are reportedly being harassed by Belizean soldiers trying 
to expel them from the area. 
  The 20 families live in an area known as "Rio Blanco," and 
they claim they are under pressure to evacuate the area. He 
added that in addition to protecting them, the Army's mission 
also seeks to determine whether the area they occupy 
is considered a nature preserve. 
  He concluded his remarks by noting that during his stay in 
Mexico he will be meeting with his Mexican counterpart, and he 
ruled out he will offer support in combating the Zapatist 
guerrillas.
