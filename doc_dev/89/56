FT  26 OCT 93 / The Cyprus communique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commonwealth heads of government met in Cyprus from October 21 to 25. Of
the 47 countries that attended the meeting, 36 were represented by heads of
state.
GLOBAL TRENDS AND PROSPECTS
Heads of government welcomed continued easing of global tensions and
expressed conviction that the United Nations was now better placed than ever
before to fulfil its role. . . They underscored the complementary role which
the Commonwealth and regional organisations could play in supporting the
efforts of the UN.
They reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, fundamental human rights, the
rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and just and honest
government as essential ingredients of the Commonwealth's fundamental
political values.
Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom
were inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing.
Commonwealth leaders stressed the need to strengthen international security
through disarmament and non-proliferation.
They noted the world economy faced grave uncertainties but believed the
current climate of low inflation and declining interest rates presented
opportunities for economic recovery.
They welcomed the broadening political consensus on market-friendly
measures, combined with human resource development and poverty reduction.
They acknowledged special difficulties of sub-Saharan Africa and noted the
performances of many countries were constrained by weak commodity prices and
deteriorating terms of trade. Big efforts were still required throughout the
developing world to overcome institutional, economic and financial barriers
to stronger growth; they also recognised these reforms should be supported
by an appropriate blend of adjustment and external financing.
They expressed disquiet at the continuing debt problems of many developing
countries and called for measures to cut the debt burden to sustainable
levels and for the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms.
They noted with concern that official development assistance had fallen in
real terms and called for action to reverse the fall in aid flows.
Commonwealth leaders noted with appreciation numerous practical measures
undertaken by the Secretariat to promote the Commonwealth fundamental
political values, including monitoring elections in seven member states.
SOUTH AFRICA
Commonwealth leaders agreed that developments had marked irreversible
progress to democracy.
They endorsed lifting of sanctions but the arms embargo would remain until a
new post-apartheid government was established with full democratic control
and accountability. But the communique recognised that the process remained
fragile and agreed the pre-eminent need was to help ensure a united,
non-fragmented, democratic and non-racial South Africa.
They agreed the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa should remain
in South Africa until after the election planned for April 1994 when the
situation would be reviewed.
MOZAMBIQUE
Leaders expressed concern at recurring delays in implementing the October
1992 peace accord and called on the Renamo opposition party to comply fully
with its terms, including despatch of its personnel to UN-administered
assembly points. They urged all concerned to co-operate in ensuring
multi-party elections are held by October 1994 and called on Renamo to
co-operate with the government in the speedy completion of an election law.
ANGOLA
They deplored continuation of the civil war and called on Unita to end
hostilities. Failure on the part of Unita to comply with UN Security Council
resolutions on Angola would justify further sanctions and other measures.
CYPRUS
Commonwealth leaders reiterated support for the independence, sovereignty,
territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus.
They stressed the importance of securing compliance with all the UN
resolutions on Cyprus, divided when Turkey invaded the northern part in
1974. Lack of progress would prompt the Commonwealth secretary general to
request the UN Security Councilto consider alternative ways to promote
effective implementation of the UN resolutions.
MIDDLE EAST
Commonwealth leaders welcomed the agreement of September 13 1993 between the
government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and expressed
the hope that the momentum for peace would be sustained.
BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA
They expressed deep concern at the continuing hostilities and urged the
international community to make all efforts to arrive urgently at a just,
equitable and comprehensive political settlement based on strict adherence
to Security Council decisions, international law and preservation and
protection of the legitimate rights and dignity of all the Bosnian
community.
BELIZE
Support was reaffirmed for the security, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Belize. The leaders urged Guatemala and Belize to resume and
successfully conclude their dialogue.
