  [Text] David Heathcoat-Amory, UK deputy secretary of state 
for foreign and commonwealth affairs, met with Bernardo Arevalo, 
then-acting deputy foreign minister, on 15 March. 
Heathcoat-Amory asked the Guatemalan official about the recent 
letter of reservation sent to the UN secretary general, within 
the framework of national reclamations over Belize. 
  Arevalo said the nonspecific portion of the letter was 
addressed, adding the UK official requested an expansion of the 
existing information on the official reservation the country has 
made before the important organization. 
  "The requested information was explained to them, and the 
issue was not further elaborated," the official explained. 
Arevalo also reported the points of the bilateral agenda 
discussed with Heathcoat-Amory during the meeting. 
  He said among the topics of discussion was the so-called San 
Jose X Meeting between Central America and the European Union, 
which will be held in Athens. Arevalo remarked Foreign Minister 
Marithza Ruiz de Vielman will participate in the meeting, 
because it will take place within the framework of the foreign 
ministers meeting of both blocs to discuss economic and 
cooperation matters. 
  In addition, during the meeting Heathcoat-Amory and Arevalo 
exchanged letters establishing the elimination of visa 
requirements for tourists traveling to and from the United 
Kingdom to Guatemala. 
  The UK official's activities also included the inauguration 
of the Anglo-Guatemalan Institute, as well as visits to the 
Defense Ministry chief of staff, the human rights ombudsman, and 
the head of the Government Peace Commission.
