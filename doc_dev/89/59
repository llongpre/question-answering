   The Central American country of Belize braced for
Tropical Storm Karen, spinning clockwise around the western
Caribbean with 40 mph winds, forecaster said Saturday.
   Storm warnings were lifted for Cuba, which was drenched with
rain before the rare, but weak, late-season tropical storm veered
south. The government of Belize extended a tropical storm watch
from its offshore islands to the entire country Saturday, the
National Hurricane Center said.
   At 5 p.m. EST, Karen's center was near 17.4 degrees north
latitude and 85.7 degrees west longitude, about 160 miles east of
Belize City, after being stationary for much of Saturday.
   A strong frontal trough was expected to push the storm toward
the northeast and deeper into the Caribbean, but no significant
change in strength was expected, said officials at the hurricane
center in suburban Coral Gables.
   On Thursday, the system surprised forecasters by reaching
tropical storm strength, defined as a storm with winds above 39
mph. At its peak, Karen's top winds hitting 55 mph.
   Reports from Cuba said Karen dumped more than 14 inches of rain
on Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth, more than 7 inches in
Matanzas and nearly 5 inches in Havana.
   While the hurricane season officially starts June 1 and ends
Nov. 30, hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.
   Belize is on the northeast coast of Central America and has a
population of 160,000.
