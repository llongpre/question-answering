  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 3 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, 
Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman said the 
Guatemalan Government is interested in resuming the stalled 
negotiations on the more than 150-year-old territorial dispute 
between Belize and Guatemala. 
  The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the 
failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge 
Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony 
until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and 
established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many 
political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his 
position. 
  Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the 
following: "As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction" in 
recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say, 
however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under. 
  She pointed out that the "Belize Council," a new council 
comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal 
with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory 
role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to 
the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose 
appointment will be announced next week, will make 
recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch 
"in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them." 
  The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but 
said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated 
solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.
