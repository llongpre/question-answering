<F P=106> [Report by Andres de Leon -- live] </F>
  [Text] Thousands of our Emisoras Unidas listeners have been 
calling to report the presence of military personnel along the 
streets and avenues of the capital. We must inform you this is 
part of the crime prevention operation to provide security for 
the Guatemalans traveling into the city from various points 
around the countryside. 
  Police, the Treasury Guard, and the Guatemalan Army are 
guarding access routes. No abnormal activity has been reported; 
everything is under control. Military personnel have been 
assigned to assist the police, and the Treasury Guard is 
checking those coming in from the countryside or leaving 
Guatemala City via one of the main access routes. 
  We have also learned military units are controlling the main 
entrance routes, specifically Puente de Belize, Incienso, and El 
Trebol, as well as key electricity high-tension pylons in the 
capital city, as prevention measures against terrorism. We 
hereby inform Guatemalans there is nothing abnormal going on in 
the country. The military personnel are assisting with security 
for those moving in an out of the city.
