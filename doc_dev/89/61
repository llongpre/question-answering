  [Text] Rigoberta Menchu, the 1992 Nobel Prize peace 
laureate, stated in Geneva recently, that the [U.S.] military 
presence in Guatemala was detrimental to the people of her 
country. She, thus, asked President Ramiro de Leon Carpio not 
to maintain U.S. troops in the country. 
  Menchu won the coveted prize a year ago. At that time, the 
then government of President Jorge Serrano Elias concocted a 
plot to stop her from receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, although 
it was the first time a Guatemalan citizen received the peace 
prize. Writer Miguel Angel Asturias won the Nobel Prize in 
literature a few years ago. 
  Nevertheless, Jorge Serrano's government refused to 
recognize 
Miss Menchu as the most worthy representative of the country and 
managed to get the important award to remain in Mexico, where it 
still remains. 
  Rigoberto Menchu gave President Ramiro de Leon Carpio her 
personal support but withdrew it a few months later. She 
alleged the current president had let down the Guatemalan people 
and withdrew her support. She continues to observe events in 
the country. 
  For this reason, when she was in Geneva recently, Menchu 
reported that U.S. soldiers had established several camps and 
were carrying out joint military operations in the country. She 
said: "The U.S. Government has decided to send thousands of 
soldiers to interfere in Guatemalan politics. We are denouncing 
this and ask the Guatemalan president to immediately withdraw 
the U.S. troops."
