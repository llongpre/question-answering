<F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio with </F>
unidentified reporters on 7 June; place not given; from the 
"Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How is the Jorge Carpio Nicolle case 
coming along? 
  [De Leon] This investigation has proven very difficult for 
the executive branch, and it has had a high cost. We have 
located a weapon, at least one weapon, which is essential 
evidence that can lead us to the perpetrators of this damnable 
crime. Ballistic tests were carried out, and it was proven that 
this weapon was at the scene of the crime, and, therefore, this 
is an unquestionable lead. This lead might take us to criminals 
here or in any part of the world. 
  These investigations have shown that the evidence we have 
against these people is such that, in my opinion, their arrests 
were warranted, and indeed this was the case. We contributed 
and even requested the Army's assistance in arresting these 
people. 
  Today, however, we see that the judge inexplicably has 
ordered the provisional release of these three people. I cannot 
interfere in a different branch of government, and I respect its 
independence. Nevertheless, one really cannot explain how these 
three people can be released today because of a lack of 
evidence, according to the judge. I repeat, the weapon that was 
fired at the crime scene has been identified, and this has been 
proven through ballistics. 
  These are the kinds of things that disappoint the people of 
Guatemala, because justice is neither swift nor adequate. These 
disappointments are what can cause increased violence and 
sometimes cause people to take the law into their own hands. It 
is very sad. 
  Again, I do not want to interfere, and I do not want this to 
be misinterpreted. I am not a judge, and I do not have the case 
file in my hands. This is the judge's responsibility. He 
issued this ruling under his own authority, but for the 
Guatemalan people, this is a slap in the face -- something that 
takes away hope and prompts the people to ask whether justice is 
fair. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what hope do the people have 
if 
the judicial system fails them in cases as important as this one? 
  [De Leon] This is the question one has to ask. If this 
happens in such a highly publicized case because of the stature 
of the individual killed, someone like Jorge Carpio -- a 
political leader, a media director -- and in a case supported by 
such a detailed investigation, as well as a case backed by 
pressure from every sector, and then the justice system goes 
ahead and rules as it did, then we must ask ourselves what can 
ordinary citizens expect. What can Indians expect from the 
justice system? It is truly disappointing. 
  I learned of the ruling through the press. If this is 
disappointing and exasperating for the president of the 
Republic, how must the Guatemalan people receive the news? 
  [Reporter] The human rights ombudsman has requested an end 
to 
military conscription because of violations even to minors 
[words indistinct]. What decision will be reached? 
  [De Leon] This is an issue that has been under discussion 
for 
a long time. There is a draft bill aimed at resolving certain 
anomalies that the defense minister himself mentioned a few days 
ago. Regrettably, once more we fall into the hands of Congress. 
Look how long ago this draft bill was presented. It has been 
sidetracked, and we have no hope that this law will be debated 
during this term of Congress. We will have to wait. 
  Nevertheless, we are going to meet with the defense minister 
and review the evidence the human rights ombudsman says he has 
in connection with certain cases. We agree that there have been 
anomalies. Nevertheless, the influx of volunteers to the 
military service over the past few months is incredible. You 
cannot imagine the number of young people who have signed up. 
In most departments, forceful conscription is unnecessary, and 
therefore we are surprised by these reports. We must accept, 
however, that these anomalies still take place, which is 
something the defense minister has accepted. We are going to 
meet with the High Command to analyze this situation and to take 
appropriate steps. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] No. No. Nothing of the sort. That is something 
that must be ruled out since we are still confronting a 
situation of armed internal conflict. Anyone who suggests 
eliminating the Army or refraining from upgrading or modernizing 
it is naive, because they are looking for us to remain without 
an Army at a time when subversive groups are still operating in 
the country. It is impossible to do that at this time. The 
Army is an issue that is included in the Constitution; in 
addition, the armed internal conflict is a reality. Acts of 
sabotage are still taking place. Yesterday they blew up an 
electricity tower in Esquintla and Taxisco. That proposal can 
be taken care of. 
  [Reporter] [word indistinct] 
  [De Leon] Keep in mind that military service is incorporated 
in Guatemala's political Constitution, and it is also every 
citizen's right and duty. The Constitution does not ask whether 
it should be done. It is a patriotic duty according to the 
constitutional norm that establishes it. When that is modified, 
then we can proceed to disband it. However, as long as it is 
not modified, it is the patriotic duty of every youth who has 
reached 18 years of age. 
  [Reporter] What programs were you referring to during your 
address in.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] In the United States? 
  [Reporter] Yes, that is correct. 
  [De Leon] That was a television program in the United 
States. Exactly what program, I can't recall. 
  [Reporter] What did you.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] By the way, I would like to say 
that, in this respect and despite the numerous problems the 
government has had, at this time it has been able to coordinate 
activities with representatives from the religious and the 
economic sectors. It was precisely the business sector that 
called my attention to this struggle against the television 
stations, or against the unjustified attacks that are being 
fabricated against Guatemala. In order words, efforts are 
currently being coordinated among the religious, military, and 
economic sectors. In this new phase we have had excellent 
relations with the business and workers sectors, always seeking 
common ground and avoiding confrontations. We are only awaiting 
the new Congress and the new Supreme Court in order to also 
begin a new relationship with the political sector. We are 
looking forward to a new National Congress, which will only be 
responsible to the Guatemalan people. We continue to abstain 
from interfering, because that is not my administration's 
policy. However, we do expect to maintain a relationship with 
the Legislative Branch in order to legislate -- even if it is in 
that congress' last year -- for the benefit of the Guatemalan 
people. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] in the conflict with Belize. 
Who are the ones causing it, and what is expected of it? 
  [De Leon] I do not know exactly.... [pauses] I just signed 
the agreement not long ago, but at this time I don't have the 
specific details at hand, or all the names. Rather than mislead 
you, I would rather give you the information afterwards. At any 
rate, the agreement has already been signed. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] During the next few days. We are only awaiting 
the return of Foreign Minister [Gladys Maritza Ruiz de] Vielman. 
She should be arriving at any time. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] you said that there are my 
sectors.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] No, I said that there are 
individuals 
who have proceeded to gather and form radical groups. 
Unfortunately these radical groups still exist. I have even 
mentioned, at one time or another, that the political will of 
some subversive groups within the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] are not interested in peace. We do not 
know if they are prepared for it. We believe that they 
themselves may feel that they are not prepared and would 
possibly prefer to postpone the signing of a peace agreement. 
Even though these are radical groups, fortunately they are 
becoming a minority. 
  [Reporter] When will the peace agreement resume? 
  [De Leon] I understand that sometime at the end of this week 
both sides will again meet. The talks are scheduled to begin 
with discussions related to the issue of displaced people. 
After that they will travel to Oslo where talks will continue. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
  [De Leon] Thank you.
