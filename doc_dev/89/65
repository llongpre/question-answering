financial services

THE steady expansion of Belize's economy over the past decade has placed new
demands on its financial services sector.
Changes are being made to domestic banking and the government is putting
into place legislation to develop an offshore financial services sector.
The 20-year-old Banking Act has worked well, says Mr Keith Arnold, governor
of the central bank, but aspects of it need to be updated. The new act,
similar to legislation in the Caribbean islands, will be completed by the
end of next year.
'We are making sure that we do not encounter any problems, and we have
learned lessons from developments such as those which have accompanied the
operations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,' says Mr
Arnold.
The new legislation will strengthen the central bank's supervisory systems,
allow greater protection of the clients of financial institutions, and
changes mandatory capital requirements. The impending changes, officials are
keen to emphasise, are merely protective.
Belize's one bank closure recently was that of a branch of a state-owned
Mexican institution which was divested. There are four commercial banks, two
of which are locally owned. 'The country is adequately banked and is
well-served by the number of banks it has,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the
manager of Barclays Bank in Belize.
New legislation is also planned to improve the country's offshore financial
services sector. 'We need to look at the possibilities of offshore banking,'
says Mr Arnold. 'We recently had a few inquiries about setting up offshore
banks in Belize but our legislation does not provide for these institutions
and we need the regulatory framework.'
The indications of interest in offshore banking followed the opening of an
International Business Companies register in 1990, similar to that of the
British Virgin Islands. The 350 companies registered so far do not pay taxes
and are not allowed to do business in Belize.
The emergent offshore business sector has also had success with its shipping
register which lists 129 vessels. New legislation has been enacted to
encourage the creation of trusts. 'This new law . . . applies to all trusts
including charitable, non-charitable purpose trusts and offshore trusts,'
explains Mr Glenn Godfrey, the attorney-general. 'The trustee is regarded as
non-resident in Belize for the purposes of exchange control.'
Thought was given by the government to the creation of a stock exchange, but
there was not enough business to support a market. An alternative was found
in the creation of public investment companies .
