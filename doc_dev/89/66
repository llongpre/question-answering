flavour - Forestry

THE CHANGING tastes of gum chewers are playing a small part in the
revitalisation of Belize's once valuable market for forest products.
The country had been a significant supplier of chicle, the base for chewing
gum, but lost the market to synthetic substitutes. Chewers again favour the
natural material and Belize is looking at an increase in chicle production.
There is unlikely to be any similar expansion in the export of other
forestry products, including hardwoods and dyes, which were once the
mainstay of the economy.
This activity, and the use of 'slash and burn' techniques by peasant
farmers, damaged significant areas of woodland. Now there is a more
enlightened approach with the emphasis on sustainable development which
seeks a careful balance between exploitation and natural and artificial
regeneration of the forest.
The concerns were dramatically illustrated a few years ago when
environmentalists objected to plans by the Coca Cola Company of the US to
grow citrus on a large tract of land it had bought in Belize.
There were threats to boycott Coca Cola products internationally. The
company balked and presented the land as a nature reserve to the Programme
for Belize, a private, non-profit corporation which is trying to achieve a
balance between conservation and sustainable economic development over the
200,000 acres which it manages.
'We are trying to get sustainable forest projects in which there is a
balance between the business aspect and concern for the environment,' says
Ms Joy Grant, managing director of the Programme for Belize. 'For example,
we would like to extract chicle and manufacture gum locally.'
Belize's forests are also being put to work by the growing tourist industry,
in particular, for holidays with an environmentalist theme. Officials say
nature trails have become more popular and that Belize has a growing
reputation among bird watchers and nature lovers.
Traditional forest industries still continue, but at a reduced level. 'There
is production of pine, mahogany, rosewood and a range of hardwoods,' reports
Mr Joe Smith, director of agricultural projects. 'These are used for local
industry and some for export. Resin from pine is being extracted and
exported for use in chemicals and adhesives.'
Exports of sawn wood products last year reached 3.8m board feet, 65 per cent
more than 1990 exports. The trend is continuing, with exports in the second
quarter of this year being 25 per cent higher than the same period of 1991.
The government is keen on adding value to exports by increasing the quantity
of processed wood and furniture, while reducing shipments of sawn timber.
The production of wood veneers has started, but the forestry sector suffers
from inadequate curing milling and facilities.
'It is the concern over the indiscriminate use of the forest which has
caused the decline in the export of forest products over the past few
years,' explains Mr Smith. 'The forest has not yet fully recovered from
exploitation. Our approach to forestry now is more enlightened because of
our concern over the impact on the environment.'
