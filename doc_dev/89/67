  [Text] Belmopan [dateline as received] -- Belizean Prime 
Minister Manuel Esquivel today announced that at the upcoming 
meeting of the Caribbean Common Market [Caricom] scheduled for 
July, he will propose the creation of a regional commission to 
establish a dialogue with the Haitian military. 
  Esquivel voiced his desire for such a commission to serve as 
mediator in the search for a solution to the crisis that Haiti 
has been experiencing since 30 September 1991, when a military 
junta overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Esquivel, who is taking part in a meeting of representatives 
and governors of Central America, the Caribbean, and the United 
States, said the proposal may be supported by other countries of 
the region, including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and 
others. Delegates of 13 Caricom member-states, Central American 
economics ministers, and eight governors from U.S. southern 
states are participating in the two-day meeting. 
  Esquivel said there is a great deal of resistance on the 
part 
of the Haitian military, perhaps because it views the United 
States as a great power. With the creation of the commission, 
which would not attempt to displace Washington, "there could be 
other alternatives," he said. 
  He added: "It is perhaps easier for the Haitians to talk 
with 
the small countries of the region rather than with the United 
States. The message would be the same; only the messenger would 
be different." 
  He believes the U.S. Government has dealt with the problem 
well. He said: "Its ideas are good. The problem is that the 
United States is the world's most powerful country. It is 
difficult for it to talk with one of the smallest countries in 
the region. I think it is also easier for the rest of the 
countries to talk with one another than with a larger country."
