  [Text] Police headquarters in Belmopan has launched a top 
flight investigation into the activities of its Belize City 
Special Branch Squad after discovering more than ten kilos of 
confiscated cocaine worth more than $350,000 on the black 
market, missing from its strong vault in Eastern Division 
Headquarters. 
  Reports say the heat is being focused on two veterans of the 
Force, both trusted members of Special Branch, who have become 
crooked cops. 
  Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga Wednesday appointed a top 
brass investigative team headed by Assistant Commissioner Ornell 
Brooks. The two others are Senior Superintendent Alvan Rowland 
and Superintendent Raymond Thimbrell. Two officers who have not 
been identified have been detained, and reports say, one or more 
arrests are imminent. 
  Police Commissioner Zuniga has promised he will hold a press 
briefing when the investigations are complete. 
  Police first knew that something was seriously wrong on 
Tuesday when a package of 2.1 kilograms of confiscated cocaine 
with special police markings to identify it turned up on the 
streets of Belize City. 
  Last Tuesday night the police busted three guys who were 
trying to peddle the stuff in front of the Fort George Radisson. 
During some intense questioning police learned the name of at 
least one officer working with the Crimes Investigation Bureau. 
  The investigation has been expanded to include the police 
Sergeant in charge of the Police strong room where confiscated 
drugs are kept under lock and key. 
  The Police image has been tarnished time after time by 
crooked cops who commit crimes and get off with just a rap on 
the wrist. This time however there is every indication that 
Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga will press criminal charges 
which could lead to extended jail sentences for the guilty 
officers.
