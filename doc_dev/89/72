<TEXT>
Belize Holdings, the Nasdaq-quoted company headed by the businessman Mr
Michael Ashcroft, chairman of ADT, yesterday took a first step in what the
company said was a strategy aimed at expanding its operations into central
America and the Caribbean.
The group bought for Dollars 13.5m a 75 per cent stake in Panama Holdings, a
new company established in Panama to invest in infrastructure projects in
that country.
Privatisation and a restructuring of companies there 'offer timely prospects
for entry into these businesses,' the company said.
Mr Ashcroft owns more than 50 per cent of the shares of Belize Holdings,
which held assets of Dollars 137m at the end of last year.
