<HEAD>US Citizen And Belize Citizen Arrested After Emergency Plane Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. citizen and a Belize citizen
were being held after their small plane made an emergency landing
on the Caribbean coast, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
   A ministry statement identified the American as Arthur Burton,
37, and the Belize citizen as Abimael Castillo Canur, 38. No
hometowns were given.
   The men were taken into custody after their Aerocommander plane
suffered a gas leak when it made an emergency landing Saturday at
Puerto Cabezas in Zelaya Norte province, 186 miles northeast of
Managua.
   ``Given the irregularity and strangeness of the case, Nicaraguan
authorities have decided to retain the crew members of the plane,''
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
   The two will remain in custody ``until we clarify their
identity, the ownership and nationality of the plan and the reasons
they were traveling without any documents,'' the statement said.
   It said neither man nor the plane carried documents and that a
flight plan had not been filed.
   A U.S. Embassy source in Managua, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would only say that a U.S. consular official had visited
Burton.
   The statement by the Nicaraguan government did not say where the
men were being held.
   The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. and Belize governments had
been notified of the case and asked for their cooperation in
clearing up the affair.
