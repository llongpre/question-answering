  [Text] "The mere fact Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado 
has strangely delayed the ruling on Mayin Correa's case for an 
illogical period of time clearly proves the official's high 
degree of evident partiality and disqualifies him for that 
post," it was stated yesterday by Jaime Padilla Beliz, president 
of the EL SIGLO Publishing Company. 
  The judicial scandal provoked by this clever decision will 
have continental repercussions, he added. The statements were 
given within the context of a meeting among various parties to 
consider the measures and actions that will be adopted when the 
unfair and absurd ruling occurs; and it will undoubtedly 
threaten the elections scheduled for 8 May. 
  Padilla Beliz has explained he attended most of the 
sessions, 
which were extended for two weeks, and no documents or any other 
evidence were presented to prove Mayor Mayin Correa had 
committed the electoral crimes with which she was charged. The 
only thing done was to present depositions signed by her sworn 
enemies, without any proof or evidence, and it was proved most 
of them lied. This was personally admitted in public by 
Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado (Pico), who was in charge of 
the proceedings. 
  Padilla Beliz continued: "Despite all this, Magistrate 
Marquez Amado insists on sentencing her, and he has prepared a 
ruling of approximately 32 pages, sentencing and disqualifying 
her for public posts for several years. He also suspended her 
prison sentence, given the lack of a criminal record, as was 
done in the case of former Attorney General Rogelio Cruz." 
  No decent person in the country will accept such a 
monstrosity, Padilla Beliz has said. "This is a country where 
lowly feelings and shameful cowardice abound. Politicians know 
Mayin is right, and she is already the city's mayor-elect with 
74 percent of the votes, according to the latest poll. 
Nevertheless, they do not dare protest because they are afraid 
of the Electoral Tribunal, and they state cunningly: "They are 
the judges, and you cannot go against them." 
  They are also the ones who will tally the votes, and they 
can 
really screw us if we oppose them in Mayin's case." That is the 
reasoning used by men who have no courage, honor, pride. I 
would rather die defending the truth and reason then to 
humiliate myself and kneel before the powerful." 
  It is known a magistrate had stated he will not sign the 
document, because he attended the trial and no one proved Mayin 
was guilty of anything." 
  Padilla Beliz asked: How, then, can Mayin be sentenced? It 
was learned the president of the Republic has personally 
threatened one of the magistrates, saying he will fire the 
magistrate's wife from a position to which she was recently 
appointed, if he rules in favor of Mayin. This happens because 
a degenerate midget who was one of General Manuel Antonio 
Noriega's intimate friends and who changed sides when he 
realized the gringos would oust him has become director of First 
Lady Ana Mae Diaz de Endara's campaign for mayor. He recently 
fabricated a poll that shows the president's wife leads in the 
polls. 
  Consequently, the president believes his wife will be mayor 
of the capital if he eliminates Mayin. 
  Padilla Beliz concluded: "They are toying with the people's 
patience, however, and anything -- for example, the Christian 
Democratic magistrate's ruling -- could unleash violence and the 
cancellation of the elections. 
  "I ask the Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates to 
meditate 
well what they can do. Set aside personal and partisan hate and 
lead the country to honest and clean elections."
