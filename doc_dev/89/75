   Central American countries need at least
$350 million to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in the
war-tattered region, according to a three-year plan released
Tuesday at an international conference.
   Delegates from 56 nations and 36 representatives of
international organizations are attending the U.N.-sponsored
Conference on Central American Refugees that opened Monday and ends
Wednesday.
   Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Costa Rica submitted the three-year plan to be considered. Details
were not released.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people, most of
them women and children, have been ``innocent victims of conflicts,
the roots of which lie in the unjust socio-economic structures in
the region,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
in opening the conference.
   Guatemala President Vinicio Cerezo told a news conference his
government has been able to help Guatemalan refugees who return
voluntarily in small numbers but is not prepared for a repatriation
of thousands.
   He said at least 43,000 Guatemalan refugees are living in Mexico
while some 200,000 refugees, most of them from Nicaragua and El
Salvador, are living in Guatemala.
   ``Their massive return could be grave because we do not have the
physical and economic capacity to solve their problems,'' he said
of the Guatemalan refugees.
   Cerezo said democray in Guatemala would be ``complete when the
Guatemalan refugees have been able to return and live in their
nation, enjoying liberty.''
   Guatemala returned to elected civilian rule three years ago
after years of military control. Cerezo's government has survived
two coup attempts.
   According to the United Nations, 146,000 registered refugees are
in Central America and Mexico, and 893,000 Central Americans are
living illegally throughout the region. About 872,000 people have
been displaced inside their countries. The U.N. figures show 61,500
refugees have been repatriated.
   Representatives of several groups helping refugees held their
news conference Tuesday and complained that their groups had not
been invited to the conference.
   Rolalinda Tuyc, president of the Commission of Those Displaced
by Violence, said her organization had asked Guatemala to allow it
to participate but was told the United Nations had made up the
guest list.
   Oswaldo Enriquez, a member of the Guatemalan Human Rights
Commission in Mexico, said, ``We reject the manipulation by the
government over the problem of refugees and people displaced by
violence.''
   He said the Guatemalan government has not improved conditions
sufficiently to encourage the Guatemalan refugees living in Mexican
camps to return home.
   A delegation of Miskito Indians from Nicaragua made public a
letter they said had been sent to the U.N. Office of High
Commissioner for Refugees asking that the Indians be reclassified
as refugees.
   It said that during the past few years the U.N. agency had
helped Nicaraguan Indians classified as refugees return to their
homeland from camps in Honduras.
   The letter said ``there persists a climate of repression against
us'' in Nicarauga, and this and ``other circumstances motivated the
return to Honduras of the great majority of those who had been
repatriated.''
