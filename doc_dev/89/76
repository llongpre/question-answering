<LEADPARA>  MY HUSBAND and I reserved our first live-aboard diving vacation, off Belize,
with a great deal of trepidation.;    The prospect of paying what seemed like
an astronomical sum to spend a week on a boat with a bunch of strangers,
living, eating and sharing bathrooms with them in a confined space, gave us
both the jitters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We promised one another there would be no recriminations if it didn't work
out.;    But after that trip, on a boat named the Isla Mia at Belize's famed
barrier reef, we were sold. The diving was stupendous, the trip was a terrific
bargain and we escaped into an ocean of peace and quiet. Since then, we have
never seriously considered a land-based diving vacation.;    Our first
misconception was the one about being squeezed in with intolerable boatmates.;
   The three boats we've been on range in length from 65 feet to 120 feet and
are surprisingly roomy. Most of them have an area for cabins (generally
doubles) as well as an upper deck for sunbathing, a salon for meals and
lazing, and, usually, a shaded outside deck. We also found most fellow divers
to be congenial and interesting.;    If worse comes to worst, there's always
the option of reading in your cabin, going for another dive or stretching out
in a deck chair with a towel draped over your face.;    The second
misconception was that we'd be bored.;    As it turned out, nothing could have
been further from the truth. We spent a lot of time diving and a lot of time
reading. Neither of us likes the casino-disco scene. After dinner, we much
prefer to read or sit on deck and look at the stars.;    In addition, many of
the live-aboard boats have video equipment. On the Okeanos Aggressor, at Cocos
Island in the Pacific Ocean off Costa Rica, and the Little Cayman Diver, off
Little Cayman Island, the between-dive and after-dinner entertainment included
film of the day's dives and movies from the boats' libraries.;    On the Isla
Mia, my husband used the video equipment to edit an underwater film he had
shot with a rental camera on board. Video and still cameras can be rented on
many boats, and many also offer photo processing.;    Initially, we thought
that the cost of a live-aboard vacation would be beyond our means. A
land-based vacation seems far less expensive, until you start figuring in the
add-ons.;    Many land-based packages include only three dives a day, while a
lot of live-aboards promise as much diving as the decompression tables or your
computer that charts nitrogen saturation will allow, sometimes even five or
six a day.;    Also, the cost of most live-aboard vacations includes room,
board, airport transfers and the cost of diving, excluding air fare and rental
of equipment if you don't own it.;    Land-based diving vacations have a way
of piling up an add-on here and there: a dinner, a lunch, a night dive, an
extra dive, a night out and so on.;    By our computations, the cost per dive
is much more attractive on most live-aboards and when it's not, you're
probably talking about a vacation so breathtaking that the extra cost is well
worth it.;    For example, seven nights and six days aboard the Belize
Aggressor off Belize cost $1,295 per person. The maximum number of dives is
27, which works out to $47.96 a dive.;    By comparison, seven nights at the
Turneffe Island Lodge, on Turneffe Islands, Belize, is $1,095 per person. The
maximum number of dives is 17, which works out to $64.41 a dive.;    We also
had misgivings about going to a faraway land and then leaving that land by
boat, ensuring we wouldn't find out much about the country the boat docks in.;
   However, all three of our boats offered island stops. And, whenever
possible, we extend our stay by a few days on either end to explore the land.;
   On the Belize trip, we spent a week on the Isla Mia -- three days doing
land-based diving off the small island of Ambergris Caye and five days in a
rented Jeep exploring, from the jungles and the jaguar preserve to the Mayan
ruins. At one point, we surprised the Belizean Army on maneuvers in tennis
shoes.;    One of the best things about live-aboard diving is getting away
from it all, visiting a realm that is wilder and purer than anything most
people will ever see from a land-based dive.;    Many of the boats run far
offshore, in places inaccessible to land-based divers because of the distance
from the mainland. There, the seas are full of creatures that don't yet know
enough to fear divers or approach them for handouts.;    We enjoyed Bonaire,
where we took classes for our scuba certification. But it wasn't long before
we were very tired of yellowtails begging for food and fish so much like
trained pets that the dive masters had given them names.;    In Belize, the
undersea life we saw off Ambergris Caye didn't compare with the profusion of
marine life we found out near the open sea at Lighthouse Reef on our
boat-based dive.;    At Cocos Island, the waters were teeming with life,
ranging from small tropical fish through medium-sized wonders like frogfish
and jumbo moray eels, to vast schools of sharks, small pods of dolphins and
even a huge, sinuous marlin.;    Live-aboard divers need to understand their
physical limitations better than divers on shore-based vacations.;    First,
although the levels of difficulty vary widely, the diving on a live-aboard
trip may be tougher because of the currents, uncharted territory, the
possibility of low visibility and other conditions.;    In addition,
boat-based divers need to know their limitations because of the relative
inaccessibility of immediate medical care, and thus boat-based diving is not
often recommended for novices.;    Increasingly, dive specialists are
recommending that live-aboard divers take time off in the middle of an
intensive week of diving to allow the body to rid itself of excess nitrogen.; 
  Many boats either rent or recommend the use of diving computers that are
worn on the wrist or attached to other diving gear. These will help calculate
the body's nitrogen saturation. It is an electronic baby sitter for those who
might go beyond the bounds of safety.;    Don't forget to take some means of
combating motion sickness, especially if you have never been at sea for any
length of time. Scopolamine patches, which are applied behind the ear, seem to
work especially well.;  (check) IF YOU GO -- See &amp; Sea Travel in San Francisco

on the boat recently. Things can change very fast in this business.  </TEXT>
