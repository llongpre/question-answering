   A 72-year-old man who was one of the U.S.
Marshals Service's ``15 most wanted'' fugitives was arrested Sunday
in the Central American nation of Belize, the marshals said.
   William Moore Pegram had been wanted by the marshals since July
1986 for federal parole violation. He fled when he was released on
bond while appealing an April 1986 grand larceny conviction in
Brownsville, Tenn., for which he was sentenced to six years in
prison, the marshals said.
   At the time of the larceny conviction, he was on parole with 10
years of time remaining to be served from a conviction in Oxford,
Miss., for bank robbery, interstate transportation of stolen
firearms and assault on a federal officer, the marshals said in a
statement.
   Deputy U.S. marshals developed information several days ago
indicating that Pegram was hiding in Belize. He was located
Saturday and kept under surveillance until his arrest Sunday
afternoon by local police, the marshals said.
   Pegram then was taken into the custody of deputy marshals and
placed on a commercial airliner bound for Houston. He was to be
returned to the federal prison system to serve the balance of time
left on prior convictions.
   Pegram, originally from New Albany, Miss., recently was featured
on the television program ``America's Most Wanted.''
   His first felony conviction was for violation of Tennessee state
liquor laws in 1940. Other convictions have been for firearms
violations, violations of internal revenue laws, bank robbery and
conspiracy, burglary of a post office, assault on federal officers,
interstate transportation of stolen property and shooting with
intent to kill a police officer.
