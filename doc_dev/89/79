   President Vinicio Cerezo said in a letter
to the U.S. ambassador that Guatemalan security forces may be
linked to the June decapitation of an Illinois man in northern
Guatemala.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Dickmeyer confirmed on Saturday
that Ambassador Thomas Stroock had received the letter, dated Sept.
6.
   ``People linked to the security forces could be responsible for
the death of U.S. citizen Michael Devine,'' Cerezo said in his
letter, a copy of which was obtained Friday night by The Associated
Press.
   ``It is our aim to pursue every investigation to determine such
responsibility, and if that's the case, find those responsible for
the act and apply the sanctions the law establishes,'' Cerezo said.
   Devine's body was found on June 9, one day after his wife,
Carole A. Moore, reported her husband's disappearance.
   Devine, 49, of Belleville, Ill., was owner of the Xobel de
Poptun inn and served as a guide for tourists. He also worked
transporting merchandise between ranches in the Poptun region near
the Guatemalan border with Belize.
   He was transporting goods when he disappeared, and he was robbed
of an undisclosed amount of money and his wristwatch.
   His body was found in a clump of bushes about two miles from the
town of Poptun, located 240 miles northeast of Guatemala City in
the province of Peten. It was bound and showed signs of
mistreatment.
   Cerezo said he has ordered the national police to clear up the
case as soon as possible, and has asked the Defense Ministry to
assist in the investigation.
   He said he has asked that arrest warrants and legal proceedings
be expedited.
   Diplomats in Guatemala have been pressuring Cerezo to put a lid
on violence.
   The Central American nation of 8 million people has been torn
apart by 28 years of leftist insurgency and brutal military tactics
to crush it.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department put out a travel
advisory for Guatemala that warned of indiscriminate terrorist
attacks, crime and fighting between the armed forces and rebels.
   Cerezo blames the latest violence on right-wing elements trying
to destabilize his centrist administration. He has been the victim
of two military coup attempts that had conservative backing.
