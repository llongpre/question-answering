  [Text] Athens, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Belize today abandoned 
the 10th Central American and European Union [EU] Foreign 
Ministers' Meeting after Greece, the host country, withdrew its 
observer status. 
  The incident occurred after the Guatemalan delegation asked 
Theodoros Pangalos, current chairman of the European Council of 
Ministers, to withdraw Belize's status as observer at the 
ministerial meeting. 
  "Belize's participation in the San Jose meetings will depend 
on the context of negotiations on the territorial dispute," it 
was stated to NOTIMEX by Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys 
Marithza Ruiz de Vielman. 
  Guatemala and Belize established diplomatic relations in 
1981, although the two countries have yet to settle a 
territorial dispute. 
  "We were invited by the council's chairman. We do not 
consider this the place to discuss differences between Guatemala 
and Belize," said Ursula Brown, Belize's ambassador to the 
United Kingdom, shortly before her departure. 
  A participant in the meeting said Greece made "a mistake in 
formalities" when it invited Belize as an observer without first 
consulting with the Central American country. 
  The problem arose when the Belizean representative stood 
close to the EU and Central American foreign ministers when 
posing for a group picture of the meeting, which is currently 
being held at an elegant hotel on the outskirts of the Greek 
capital. 
  Belize, with a population of 200,000, achieved its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1986, and Guatemala has 
demanded the return of part of their common border since then. 
  Although Belize had been invited to participate as an 
observer in other international forums on Central America, this 
was the first time it had been invited to participate in the San 
Jose Summit.
