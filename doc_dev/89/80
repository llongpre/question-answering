   The civilian government of President
Vinicio Cerezo said it thwarted a coup attempt today by air force
officers and soldiers.
   Government spokesman Carlos Anleu said troops loyal to Cerezo
arrested an undetermined number of air force personnel who
participated in the coup attempt, which lasted about two hours.
   ``Everything is under control,'' Anleu said. He said the coup
was put down with no shots fired.
   The attempt was staged by a tactical unit of the air force based
south of Guatemala City in a military section of the international
airport, Anleu said, and was led by retired military officers. He
did not identify them.
   The coup attempt was stopped when soldiers loyal to the
government entered the city in tanks and helicopters, the spokesman
said.
   About 6:30 a.m. troops and soldiers, many wearing the blue
handerkerchiefs that are a sign of loyalists, surrounded the home
of the defense minister, Gen. Alejandro Gramajo. Military planes
and helicopters flew overhead and tanks were parked strategically
nearby.
   In May 1988, a military coup attempt failed when Gramajo refused
to join it and backed the civilian government.
   By 8:30 a.m., most of the troops had returned to their barracks
and the aircraft returned to their bases. Morning rush-hour
activity had returned to normal in the capital. Radio stations
played military music during the attempt, then returned to normal
programming.
   In Washington, a State Department official said reports from the
U.S. Embassy and from Guatemalans also indicated the coup attempt
was unsuccessful. The official said the coup attempt may have been
aimed not at Cerezo, whose whereabouts were unknown, but at Granajo
or other cabinet ministers.
   Cerezo took office in January 1986, heading the first elected
civilian administration in 16 years. He had been under attack from
the right wing for opening talks with the leftist insurgency, the
Revolutionary Union, which has been conducting a guerrilla war for
30 years.
   During the attempted coup by army officers on May 11, 1988, two
columns of troops marched on the capital to seize power. But their
attempt was quashed without a shot being fired. Six officers were
arrested.
   On April 16, Cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for a
growing wave of violence and said they threatened the nation's
democracy. ``Democracy is being put in danger by the recklessness
of some groups and people who constantly violate the law,'' he said
in a nationally broadcast address.
   The president blamed the right-wing groups for the death of Irma
Esquivel de Lara, 37, a criminal court judge who was gunned down on
a street in the capital earlier in April.
   ``There exist some groups traditionally of the extreme right
that aren't happy with democracy. They don't like it that we are
satisfied with a democratic government,'' Cerezo said at the time.
   Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, is due to leave office in 1991.
   The Central American nation of 8.5 million people, about the
size of Tennessee, is bounded on the north and west by Mexico, the
south by the Pacific Ocean and the east by El Salvador, Honduras
and Belize.
   Guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment. It
is widely agreed that civilian authority exists because of military
consent and supervision.
   Guatemala was widely shunned by the international community
while the country was under the military rulers of the early 1980s.
The armed forces and death squads linked to the military were
blamed for killing tens of thousands of people. The army denied the
charges.
   Thousands of Indians were killed or driven into the hills. More
than half the population is made up of Indians who speak two dozen
Mayan dialects.
   Former President Carter cut off U.S. aid to the country, but
non-military aid was restored under the Reagan administration.
