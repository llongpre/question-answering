Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the forces.
But several ex-colonial duties (Belize, Bermuda, Hong Kong) are soon to
disappear, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind means the geographical extension,
the fourth place in the global pecking order will not last long.
Some Tories say they are not convinced by Mr Rifkind's claim to appreciate
the value of breadth.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, says the
government fails to see the advantages of deploying troops overseas.
'I am extremely angry about our withdrawal from Belize,' he said yesterday,
claiming that the UK was losing an important area of influence.
Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare, said the quality of British
servicemen was enhanced by the wide range of locations in which they
operate.
'I would like to see our servicemen train in every climate and zone to which
they might be deployed,' he said.
Mingled with an attachment to the legacy of empire that is tinged with
sentiment, there is a more substantial point. Yesterday's document
repeatedly suggests that the quality of Britain's armed forces is one of its
principal assets in the international market-place.
To borrow a phrase coined by Mr Douglas Hurd, a high-performance army is one
of the things that enables Britain to 'punch above its weight' in world
affairs.
As Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out,
this is a new argument for the defence establishment as it takes on the
Treasury. It is a strong argument: the selection of Britain to train South
Africa's new defence forces, and the prominence of British forces in Bosnia
are two recent examples of the prestige the UK has earned through the
pursuit of military excellence.
If defence chiefs can convince Whitehall that they represent one of
Britain's comparative advantages in the world, the UK can still play a role
far beyond its shores long after all its colonial business is finished.
