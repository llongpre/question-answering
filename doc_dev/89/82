   A sharp increase in opium production in
Guatemala has prompted the State Department to add that country to
its list of ``drug problem'' countries, an administration official
said Tuesday.
   According to official estimates, the Guatemala acreage devoted
to opium is sufficient for a 12-ton yield. Any country with a yield
of 5 tons or more is automatically placed on the State Department
list.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said that
inclusion on the list does not constitute criticism of Guatemala's
efforts to curb drug trafficking.
   He said smugglers send raw opium from Guatemala to Mexico where
it is refined into heroin for shipment to the United States.
   Guatemala joins 10 other Latin American and Caribbean countries
on the list - Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, Jamaica, the Bahamas,
Belize, Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Panama. Fourteen Asian and
Middle Eastern countries are also on the list.
   The only other hemispheric country where there is sizeable opium
production is Mexico. But production in Mexico and Guatemala is
minuscule next to such countries as Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and
Laos, according to official statistics..
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman in Guatemala City, James Dickmeyer,
said the Guatemalan government has tried to curb opium poppy and
marijuana production and to curtail cocaine shipments from
Colombia.
   Diplomatic sources said President Vinicio Cerezo is being urged
to use the Guatemalan military to stop cocaine trafficking through
Guatemala.
   Two prominent citizens were killed recently in what appeared to
be incidents linked to drug trafficking.
   Heavily armed men shot banker Ramiro Castillo Love to death at
his home on Aug. 24.
   ``He refused to launder drug money,'' former vice president
Mario Sandoval Alarcon, a friend of Castillo's, said.
   Danilo Barillas, head of a commission investigating corruption
in the Christian Democrat party and widely believed to have found
links to the Colombian cartels, was killed on Aug. 1.
