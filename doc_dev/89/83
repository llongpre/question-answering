   Wendy Davis hasn't slept well since leaving
Belize six years ago to come to the United States illegally, but
she expects that to change once she receives her papers under the
federal amnesty program.
   ``I had insomnia. I worried at night that someone could come and
take me away. When my papers come, I'm going to sleep at night,''
said Mrs. Davis, one of thousands of illegal aliens who jammed
Immigration and Naturalization Service offices in south Florida on
Wednesday, the last day to apply for residency under the law.
   The law permitted people who came to the United States illegally
before Jan. 1, 1982, and lived in this country continuously to
apply for temporary resident status. They later must apply for
permanent status and can eventually apply for citizenship.
   Immigration officials expected up to 125,000 aliens to apply in
Florida. By Wednesday morning, 112,000 had done so, and
applications were pouring in as the midnight deadline neared, said
Richard Smith, deputy director of the Miami INS office.
   Like Mrs. Davis, many said they waited until the last minute
simply because they procrastinated. Lines were long at the INS
office here, but most of the waiting people were smiling.
   ``They say this place is bad, but it's the best there is,'' Mrs.
Davis said, referring to U.S. citizens who complain about their
government.
   But as an illegal alien, ``I didn't have a life of my own,
control of my destiny,'' said Mrs. Davis, 19, who married Judd
Davis, a Chicago native, last July 4. The newlyweds moved recently
to Miami Beach, which reminds her of Belize City, which she
couldn't risk visiting as an illegal alien for fear of not being
allowed back into the United States.
   A sister and two brothers in Belize ``keep writing, asking me
when I'm going to visit. I wanted to go but I couldn't. I'd say I
was going soon as I get my papers,'' she said, beaming at the
prospect of receiving a work permit next week and residency status
this summer.
   Mrs. Davis' mother, a nurse, moved illegally to the United
States when her daughter was 3. Almost 10 years later, she sent for
her children, and friends smuggled three of them into the United
States via Mexico.
   ``I went right through the border. They just asked if we had
fruits,'' she said. She lived in Chicago with her mother, who
applied for amnesty Tuesday, and attended the Kenwood Academy there.
   Her husband, who works at a Miami Beach apartment complex, said
his wife's easy entry compounded her immigration woes. ``They say
she couldn't have gotten through the border. It'd be easier if we
said she swam across the Rio Grande.''
   The couple said they were advised it would be faster for her to
receive a work permit by seeking amnesty rather than applying as a
citizen's spouse. When the papers come through, the Davises plan to
save up, buy a home on Miami Beach, and visit Belize often.
