   The bound and decapitated body of an
Illinois man who worked as a travel guide has been found in a
remote area of northern Guatemala, a police officer in the region
said.
   The body of Michael Vernon Devine, 49, of Belleville, Ill., was
discovered June 9, the officer said in a telephone interview. The
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Devine's money
and watch were missing but that he did not know if robbery was the
only motive for the killing.
   The body was found about two miles from the town of Poptun, 240
miles northeast of Guatemala City in the province of Peten, the
officer of the provincial capital of Flores said.
   The tied-up body was found in a clump of bushes, the policeman
said.
   He did not say who found the body.
   The disappearance of Devine, a tourist guide who owned the Xobel
de Poptun inn, was reported by his wife, Carole A. Moore, the
officer said.
   Devine also transported merchandise between ranches in the
Poptun region near the Guatemalan border with Belize, the officer
said.
   The victim was transporting goods when he disappeared, the
officer said. He did not identify the goods or say whether Devine's
vehicle was taken.
   Officials at the U.S. Consulate in Guatemala City said it did
not have any information on the case.
