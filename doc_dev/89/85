  [Text] The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda 
Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] recently abducted 
three traditional leaders in Belize District, Cabinda Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] In fact, three 
traditional leaders were abducted by FLEC-FAC recently. I do 
not know what the causes of the abduction are. I cannot say 
anything else because I am still investigating the issue. It is 
only known that they have been detained. Maybe it is because 
they are traditional leaders linked to the government. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] According to reports you have, 
are they in a good health? 
  [Official] Well, recently we received a message from the 
Belize District administration saying that they are being 
ill-treated and run the risk of being killed. Two days ago, 
however, I received a report from the Belize administrator 
saying that they are in good health and have a limited freedom, 
but they are still in the hands of FLEC. [end recording]
