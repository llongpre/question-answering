   Tropical storm warnings were posted early Sunday
for the Caribbean coastlines of Mexico and Belize as forecasters
predicted Tropical Storm Diana could strengthen.
   The storm warnings extended from Cancun, Mexico, to Belize City,
including offshore islands, according to a statement by the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. Up to 5 inches
of rain is possible in sections of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   Heavy rainfall was also possible along the north coast of
Honduras, the center reported.
   Forecasters predicted Diana could intensify Sunday as it moves
through the western Caribbean. Maximum sustained winds early Sunday
were near 45 mph.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Diana was centered near 17.7 north latitude and
85.4 west longitude, or 250 miles south southeast of Cancun. It was
moving northwest at 14 mph, and that motion was expected to
continue through Monday.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Cesar was crossing the mid-Atlantic
with 50 mph winds and posing no threat to land.
   Cesar was centered at 6 a.m. EDT near 24.2 north latitude and
46.7 west longitude, or about 1,250 miles east southeast of Bermuda.
   ``Cesar is really not of any concern to anybody ... except for
maybe some shipping,'' Noel Risnychok of the hurricane center said
Saturday.
   The storm was moving northwest at 12 mph.
