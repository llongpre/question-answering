  [Text] San Jose, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rica has 
abandoned the "banana war" it was waging with other Latin 
American nations against the European Union (EU) and accepted an 
offer shortly after the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Bernd Niehaus as OAS secretary general. Roberto Rojas, Costa 
Rican foreign trade minister, told ACAN-EFE that this agreement, 
negotiated last week with Rene Steichen, EU commissioner for 
agricultural matters, "has nothing to do" with Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general. 
Rojas assured that the largest banana producers in the 
Caribbean, such as Belize and Jamaica, voted for Costa Rica on 
Sunday in Washington and that the agreement with the EU 
safeguards the advantages it has always granted to these small 
nations. 
  At the OAS election, some Caribbean nations, as well as 
Panama and Ecuador, which had committed their votes to Costa 
Rica, broke their pledges at the last minute and voted for the 
Colombian president. This gave Gaviria the victory to lead the 
OAS for the next five years. 
  These events caused strong misgivings in Costa Rican 
diplomatic and political circles because, according to Rojas, 
vigorous U.S. pressure in support of Gaviria included the use of 
the banana issue as a negotiating tool. Nevertheless, the Costa 
Rican minister assured that the "banana war" did not have a 
bearing on changes in OAS votes, although there was an attempt 
to link the "banana war" to Foreign Minister Niehaus' bid to 
become OAS secretary general. Neihaus lost to Gaviria by a vote 
of 20-14. 
  The European commissioner today appeared satisfied with the 
agreement which, besides resolving the dispute, "assures that 
the EU's objectives in regulating banana imports will continue 
to be respected." For Steichen, this guarantees respect for the 
interests of EU banana consumers and producers, as well as of 
the producers of the fruit in Africa, the Caribbean, and the 
Pacific. 
  Costa Rica was the most ardent challenger -- followed by 
Colombia -- of the EU restrictions that have been in force since 
July. Costa Rica now will benefit the most by this agreement. 
The agreement grants Costa Rica a 23.4 percent share (25 
million cases) of the quota established for all banana imports 
from Latin America. Of the 2.1-million ton quota for this year 
and 2.2-million tons for next year, Colombia will obtain 22 
percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent. 
  The agreement also includes a reduction in (import) tariffs 
from 100 ECU's [European Currency Units] ($112) per ton to 75 
ECU's ($75), as well as granting 70 percent of the import 
licenses to the producing nation. This was one of the most 
controversial issues in the Latin American-EU dispute. 
  Europe imposed a quota system on Latin American banana 
imports on 1 July, reducing its purchases from 2.5 million to 2 
million tons. This unleashed charges from the Latin Americans -- 
led by Costa Rica -- before the GATT, which ultimately ruled in 
favor of the producers, claiming that the EU system violated 
basic GATT principles. 
  The other four nations -- Ecuador, the world's largest 
producer that will have a smaller quota to export to the EU; 
Panama; Honduras; and Guatemala -- will continue their struggle 
before GATT. Of these nations, only Guatemala is a full member 
of this trade agreement, while Honduras is in the process of 
joining. 
  After a meeting with the Costa Rican producers, Rojas said 
this agreement will allow Costa Rica to arrive feeling satisfied 
at the signing of the Final Document of GATT's Uruguay Round on 
15 April in Marrakesh, Morocco. Rojas stated: "This agreement 
will create market and price stability while resolving this very 
difficult controversy for Costa Rica and the producers." At the 
same time, Rojas highlighted the importance of the European 
market for his country. 
  Rojas assured that his country will remain a member of the 
Union of Banana Exporting Countries and will attend all meetings 
in which this matter is studied. Nevertheless, he made it clear 
that the bloc that had negotiated with the EU has been 
dissolved. In this regard, Rojas said Costa Rica will attend the 
meeting of producing nations to be held in Panama on 8 April to 
explain the reasons for and the terms under which Costa Rica 
accepted the EU's proposal.
