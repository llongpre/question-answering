   Tropical Storm Miriam turned away from the
Pacific coast after heavy rains cut short a cycling race in
Guatemala and sent children home from school early in southern
Mexico.
   Guatemala, El Salvador and southern Mexico, barely affected by
the storm that left at least 111 dead in five other Latin American
countries, called off states of alert that had been in effect
Sunday and Monday.
   As Hurricane Joan, the storm killed 21 people in Costa Rica,
four in Panama, 25 in Colombia and 11 in Venezuela. It also claimed
50 lives in Nicaragua as it tore from the Atlantic to the Pacific
before being downgraded to a tropical storm and renamed Miriam.
   The storm affected all Central American countries except tiny
Belize and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
   Forecasters had feared it would regain strength and become a
hurricane again as it reached the warm waters of the Pacific, but
it did not.
   At 11 a.m. EDT, Miriam's center was near latitude 14.8 north,
longitude 94.2 west, or about 75 miles off the coast of Mexico in
the Gulf of Tehuantepec, according to the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of near 50
mph and was expected today to resume heading west northwest at
about nine mph. A storm becomes a hurricane when maximum sustained
winds reach 74 mph.
   Flash flood and mud slide warnings remained in effect today for
Guatemala and El Salvador.
   About 1,500 people living near coastal rivers in El Salvador
were evacuated Monday. The airport opened Monday morning after
being closed Sunday.
   In Guatemala, bicyclists competing in the rain during the fifth
day of a two-week cycling tour were excused from 10 miles of the
race because of the rain. Despite light flooding in southern
Guatemala, officials said evacuations were not necessary.
   Nicaragua suffered the most from Hurricane Joan as it lashed the
Caribbean coast and then ripped its way over land to the Pacific.
   The Nicaraguan government said about 300,000 people were
homeless and at least 40 people were missing.
   Bluefields, a Nicaraguan port city on the Caribbean with a
population of 38,000, was in tatters with at least 6,000 homes
destroyed and few buildings still with roofs. Officials said at
least 21 people were killed in Bluefields.
   In Managua, the storm toppled electrical towers and tore down
telephone lines and trees. Many people living beside riverbeds lost
their homes.
   Much of the Nicaraguan capital remained without electric power
or drinking water Monday and the government ordered schools to
remain closed so schoolchildren could help with reconstruction work.
   In an interview broadcast on state radio Monday, Agrarian Reform
Minister Jaime Wheelock said floods and strong winds caused the
heavy damage to three basic foods _ rice, beans and bananas _ and
also affected export crops such as coffee, cotton and sugar cane.
   The storm destroyed almost all 2,470 acres of coconut palms and
80 percent of the African palm plantations in southern Nicaragua
and 40 percent of the banana plantations, he said.
   The first relief flights arrived in Managua and Bluefields on
Sunday, carrying doctors, food and medicine from Cuba. The Mexican
government flew in relief supplies Monday, Mexican television said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater claimed
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua was using the storm tragedy as
propaganda against the Reagan administration's support of rebels
fighting the country's leftist Sandinista government.
   Fitzwater said no request for U.S. aid had been received from
the Nicaraguan government and none was expected.
   Nicaragua appealed for international aid but Ortega said ``the
best humanitarian the United States could give us would be to stop
its terrorist policies against Nicaragua.''
   The Nicaraguan government estimates that the 7-year-old war with
the rightist rebels, known as Contras, has inflicted $12 billion
worth of damage on the country.
