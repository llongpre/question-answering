THE ANGRY resignation of Argentina's interior minister has brought out into
the open a bitter row over President Carlos Menem's drive to amend the
constitution so he can stand for a second term, Reuter reports from Buenos
Aires.
Mr Gustavo Beliz, a 32-year-old lawyer sworn in just nine months ago as a
symbol of clean government, stormed out on Monday after accusing some of Mr
Menem's closest aides of dirty tactics in their campaign to change the
constitution.
Mr Beliz, who has close links to leaders of Argentina's Roman Catholic
church, said in his letter of resignation that unidentified senior officials
were generating 'an unacceptable state of suspicion' by the way in which
they tried to further Mr Menem's goal.
The outgoing minister had also charged in an interview published on the eve
of his resignation that some of Mr Menem's aides were prepared to buy
opposition votes in the 257-seat lower house of parliament, which must
approve by a two-thirds majority any proposal to change the constitution.
Although Mr Beliz never named any of his targets, one of his aides singled
out Mr Eduardo Bauza, Mr Menem's influential chief of staff and his main
political operator.
Mr Menem, who took over from his predecessor Mr Raul Alfonsn at the height
of a bout of hyperinflation in 1989, will have to step down in July 1995 if
he cannot get the constitution changed.
He says his team's success in reining in inflation must be given a further
lease of life with a second term in office.
