<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has filed a 
lawsuit against Jaime Padilla Beliz, editor of the newspaper EL 
SIGLO, alleging slander and libel. 
  The president has voiced his anger over a report published 
today in EL SIGLO. The report refers to statements by 
journalist and attorney Jaime Padilla Beliz who said it was 
learned the very president of the Republic was threatening one 
of the Electoral Tribunal magistrates with firing his wife from 
a position to which she was recently appointed if he rules in 
favor of Mayin Correa, Panama City mayoral candidate, in a case 
at the Electoral Tribunal. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] I am suing him for slander, 
because it is absolutely false I threatened an Electoral 
Tribunal official with dismissals or any other measure. The 
meetings and conversations I have held with Electoral Tribunal 
officials have dealt with what the president can do to benefit 
the elections. 
  The conversations with Electoral Tribunal officials have 
been 
limited to budgetary concerns, special credits, and making their 
job easier. That is the only relationship I have maintained 
with the Electoral Tribunal magistrates. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the fact your wife is 
also running for mayor of Panama City may create a conflict of 
interest; what is your opinion? 
  [Endara] I definitely have an interest. I am not going to 
lie and say I have no interest. I have an interest, but as 
president of the Republic I will not do anything in favor of 
that candidacy. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Jaime Padilla Beliz, EL SIGLO editor, is out of 
the country and is unavailable for comment on the president's 
lawsuit. 
  On the other hand, Endara Galimany said he met with labor 
leaders of the ports and tourism taxi association as well as 
employees of the duty-free shops to analyze the crisis generated 
by the closing of the so-called duty-free shops. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] The solution is for them to sell 
items that interest tourists. As is known, here in Panama there 
are a series of items, electronics, calculators, radios, tape 
recorders, etc., in which tourists are especially interested. 
The import duty on these items is nearly zero, precisely to 
attract tourists. Those shops must sell items for tourists. 
[end recording] 
  The president expressed his optimism over the results of 
this 
meeting, but he did not specify when he will define the status 
of the duty-free shops.
