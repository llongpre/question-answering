<LEADPARA>  The students at Addison School should be able to garner another 100 acres of
land by the time summer vacation starts in two weeks. These Palo Alto
schoolchildren are not land barons, however. They're just on a quest to do
what's environmentally correct.;    Last year, the students chipped in $3,690
to buy 123 acres of rain forest in the tiny Central American nation of Belize.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 350 students hope to raise $3,000 to buy more land this year, said Jan
Fliegel, the parent who started the program at Addison.;    Klutz Press in
Palo Alto has pledged to match the amount the school raises, up to $4,500. The
contributions will be turned over to the Nature Conservancy, which in turn
will add to the $7 million international goal to purchase 110,000 acres of
privately owned rain forest along the Rio Bravo in western Belize. At $30 an
acre, the land is a bargain by Palo Alto standards.;    And as any Addison
student will tell you, preservation of the rain forest is imperative. With
hundreds of acres of rain forests surrendering to progress every day,
scientists have warned, the Earth is vulnerable to global warming. Besides,
400 birds and animals, many of them endangered, reside in the Belizean rain
forests.;    Addison is "by far the leading donor among student groups and
schools," Nature Conservancy officials said in a letter to the school.;    The
students plan to continue the project next year. "We just can't get the kids
interested in something and then drop it," Fliegel said. They are also
planning to do something closer to home, like working to preserve the wetlands
or clean up the Bay.;    NEW MAN IN TOWN: Mountain View City Manager Kevin
Duggan has picked Milpitas park and recreation director David Muela to be the
city's first community services director. The $77,000 position was created
under the November reorganization by Duggan to streamline City Hall.;   
Muela, who also teaches municipal park and leisure services administration at
San Francisco State, will oversee Shoreline park, the new performing arts
center, recreation and parks. He was picked from a pool 100 applicants. He'll
report to work on June 28.;    WHAT TO DO: What to do with Moffett Field in
post-Cold War Pentagon belt-tightening is a subject that can provoke many
suggestions. If the airfield is closed, should NASA and Lockheed Missiles &amp;
Space retain the free use of the runways? Should local governments assume
control of the land and develop much-needed housing for the area? Or perhaps
build a new Candlestick Park there? The issue will no doubt dominate local
politics in the near future.;    A local cable TV show is trying to examine
the possible uses for the naval base. Scheduled to appear on "Citizen
Democracy in Mountain View" are Robin Parker, a Sunnyvale councilwoman and
chairwoman of the Sunnyvale-Mountain View Joint Council Committee on Moffett
Field; Tim Cuneo, superintendent of the Whisman School District; Lenny Siegel,
director of the Pacific Studies Center and chair of the New Moffett Committee;
and Larry Milov from the NASA Ames Research Center. The show, with host Gary
Bond, will be on Mountain View Community Television cable channel 30 on
Wednesday, June 5, between 6 and 7 p.m.  </TEXT>
