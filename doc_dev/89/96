  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The agreement 
on human rights reached in Mexico by the Guatemalan Government 
and the guerrillas is the greatest outcome in three years of 
negotiations and opens the possibility for President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio to meet his objective of pacifying the nation. 
  The former human rights ombudsman -- who became Guatemala's 
president on 6 June 1993 in the midst of a terrible political 
crisis originated by ousted President Jorge Serrano's failed 
self-coup -- has paved the way to peace with the signing of an 
overall agreement on human rights with the rebels. 
  The Government Peace Commission (Copaz) and the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity's (URNG) "military command" reached 
this agreement in Puebla (Mexico) after overcoming several 
obstacles throughout three years of conversations. 
  The agreement with the rebels strengthens Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio's administration, which during his 10 months in power has 
lost credibility and the support of the diverse sectors of 
society that demand an end to the conflict and better living 
conditions. People's leaders consulted by ACAN-EFE indicated 
that light can now be seen at the end of the tunnel and that 
even though the agreement has been signed true hope lies in its 
fulfillment and the beginning of the end of the massacre. 
  "The signing of the agreement is a victory for the whole 
community that pressured the government and the guerrillas. It 
is not a voluntary gift, although it fell on Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio," stressed Rosario Pu, leader of the Committee of Peasant 
Unity (CUC). 
  Meanwhile, Rosalina Tuyuc, leader of the National Commission 
of Guatemalan Widows (Conavigua), told ACAN-EFE that a first 
step has been taken for a constitution of civilian communities 
[pueblos civiles] and that this agreement will stimulate and 
support the people. "For us the signing of this accord is very 
important because it opens up a space for society," she 
highlighted. 
  Meanwhile, Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia 
Laguardia said the agreement gives "a new glimmer of hope to the 
population" because the parties have demonstrated their 
democratic calling to reach an understanding. Garcia recognized 
that the work of Frenchman Jean Arnault was a key to reaching 
the accord, with which the incipient democracy will be 
strengthened in the medium- and long-term. For the human rights 
ombudsman now "it is necessary to form a national front of peace 
to discuss an agreement of social conditions as the only way to 
end the instability." 
  Nineth Montenegro, president of the Mutual Support Group 
(GAM), also told ACAN-EFE that after 34 years of war the 
agreement represents "a significant step forward" in the 
attainment of peace. "I am very happy to hear there is talk of 
democratizing and demilitarizing the country," the human rights 
leader remarked. 
  The issue of human rights was the most complex one of the 11 
points on the agenda agreed upon in Mexico in 1991 by the 
government and the URNG under the mediation of Catholic Bishop 
Rodolfo Quezada Toruno. According to Quezada Toruno, who was 
dismissed from the negotiations by de Leon Carpio, who in turned 
requested the UN mediation, under his mediation the parties were 
nearing the signing of an accord, but the foiled coup 
perpetrated by Serrano on 25 May 1993 ruined all the efforts. 
  The peace negotiations became bogged down several times 
during the coupist government of Serrano, and although de Leon 
gave new momentum to the process, it was not until last January 
that his representatives were able to meet for the first time 
with rebel leaders in Mexico. 
  De Leon removed the main players of the government in the 
process and appointed Hector Rosada to head the government 
delegation. Rosada has been charged with exerting pressure to 
force Quezada Toruno's removal and dissolve the National 
Reconciliation Commission. 
  The signing of the human rights accord and its international 
verification mark the end of a 34-year-old armed confrontation 
in Guatemala, the only country in Central America where tension 
remains. The undeclared civil war has left more than 150,000 
people dead, some 250,000 widows, and 45,000 missing persons due 
to political reasons, as well as thousands of refugees.
