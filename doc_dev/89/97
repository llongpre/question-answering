   Several soldiers were being held in
connection with the decapitation of an Illinois man who ran a
tourist lodge in Guatemala, an army spokesman said Wednesday.
   Col. Carlos Fernando Duran said the soldiers were at the Santa
Elena military base in the northern province of Peten.
   He refused to say how soliders were being held, but several
local newspapers and a television station reported there were four.
   Michael Devine, 49, was found slain on June 9 two miles from
Poptun, a town about 240 miles northeast of Guatemala City near the
border with Belize.
   The Belleville, Ill., man owned the Xobel de Poptun Inn. He also
worked as a tourist guide and transported goods for ranches in the
area.
   Duran said the soldiers were being held on the order of a judge
in Flores, the provincial capital. He did not say if other suspects
also were being sought.
   Earlier this month, President Vinicio Cerezo said in a letter to
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Strock that ``people linked to the security
forces could be responsible'' for Devine's death.
   The president said he had changed the posts of military
authorities ``so that for no reason can obstacles to development of
the investigations or judicial process crop up.''
   Also this month, the U.S. State Department issued a travel
advisory for Guatemala, citing ``indiscriminate terrorist
attacks,'' crime and fighting between the armed forces and rebels.
