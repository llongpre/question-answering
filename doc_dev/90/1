<LEADPARA>  IN 1857, Elisha G. Otis invented the passenger elevator. Fifteen years later,
William LeBaron Jenny designed the first skyscraper, a 10-story structure.;   
Naturally, someone had to invent the elevator before someone could build a
skyscraper, but the same year that gave us the skyscraper gave us the
commercial electric fan. Cool.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If these seemingly disparate historical tidbits attract you, then leaf
through "The New York Public Library Desk Reference," a book full of
surprises. It is based on the more than 5 million questions the library and
its 82 branches answer each year.;    Vartan Gregorian, former president and
chief executive officer of the library, writes in his preface, ". . . unlike
annuals and almanacs that need revising and updating each year, the Desk
Reference (Stonesong Press, $34.95) holds a considerable amount of true
reference information, unchanging basic facts and background.;    "We also
hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to browse through.";    It
is.;    For instance, if you know Thomas Alva Edison invented the phonograph
in 1878, you will be pleased to know L.O. Colvin  invented the milking machine
the same year, and James J. Ritty  invented the cash register the year after
that.;    These were heady times, a veritable cascade of brainstorms. But
every year was like that.;    For instance, last year was the 110th birthday
of the hearing aid, and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button. It also
was the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway. It was
the 90th anniversary of the paper clip.;    This year is the 100th birthday of
the flashlight (by England's Bristol Electric Lamp Co.), the aluminum boat (by
Switzerland's Escher Wyss &amp; Co.) and the zipper (by Whitcombe L. Judson).;   
The Desk Reference has less esoteric fare. It tells you how to write your
member of congress and how to call toll-free for rental cars and hotels. There
are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe.;    There is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and one on
how to play board games from backgammon to Scrabble or cards  from blackjack
to solitaire.;    There is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols,  from extinct
animals to semaphore, from etiquette to legal forms, from animal first aid to
a directory of poison control centers.;    It's also a settler of arguments.
Take religion: The book says there are 648 million Hindus, 18 million Jews,
840 million Muslims, 158 million Orthodox Catholics, 307 million Buddhists and
5.6 million followers of Confucius.;    In the United States, there are 31
million Baptists, 2.7 million Episcopalians, 13.5 million Methodists, 2.8
million Mormons, 8 million Lutherans and 700,000 Jehovah's Witnesses. But
worldwide, there are 900 million Roman Catholics, the largest Christian Church
in the world. It takes 6 1/2 pages to list all the popes.;    One thing that
strikes the reader is how long ago some of the inventions sprang from the
human mind. And what in the world did mankind do before they came along?;   
We were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by unknown
gunsmiths.  </TEXT>
