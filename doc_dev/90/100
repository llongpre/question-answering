   The economy rolled through June at its greatest growth rate since last December, the nation's purchasing managers said. 

   The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that both production and new orders grew at a "brisk pace." 
At the same time, vendor deliveries slowed considerably, reflecting tight supplies of many commodities. 
Prices, meanwhile, rose for the 21st consecutive month. 

   "The brisk increase in new orders, unquestionably spurred by the magnificent gain in export orders, suggests the second half will at least begin with strong economic growth," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee. 

   The prospects for stronger growth also focus attention on several potential inflation "hotspots," including lengthening lead times and shortages of some basic materials that could pressure prices throughout the production pipeline. 

   The purchasing managers' index jumped to 59.3% in June from 55.1% the previous month. 
The index measures new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment. 
A reading above 50% indicates that the economy is generally expanding while a reading below 50% signals the economy is generally declining. 
June marks the 23rd consecutive month in which the gauge topped 50%. 

   The June level raised the average for the index to 55.8%. 
The purchasers said experience indicates that if that average were to hold for the rest of the year, it would be consistent with real growth in the gross national product of about 3.6%. 
Real gross national product is the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services. 

   The survey is compiled from data provided by more than 250 purchasing managers. 
It looks at several economic measures and asks whether each category strengthened or weakened from the previous month. 

   Exports continue at a healthy clip, according to the group. 
Of the 68% of members who export goods, 38% reported higher export orders in June, up from 35% the previous month. 

   Deliveries, however, slowed further. 
The difference between members reporting slower deliveries and those reporting faster receipt of supplies grew to 27% from 14% the previous month. 

   Meanwhile, inventories declined and the purchasers reported a growing list of commodities that are rising in price and shrinking in supply. 
They listed a long string of materials that rose in price -- ranging from corrugated shipping containers and other paper products to plastic resins and vegetable oils. 
They didn't note any materials that fell in price.
