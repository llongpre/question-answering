   Elmer Booze strides onto the concert stage for
another virtuoso performance, but nobody applauds. He shares the
spotlight but never takes a bow. His name doesn't even appear in
the program.
   So what? The guy spends most of the evening staring at the sheet
music and wetting his thumb and forefinger. Big deal.
   Any pianist, though, will say that Elmer Booze really is a big
deal. He is a professional page turner, one of the most
indispensable _ and most anonymous _ figures in the musical world.
   Booze, 57, a small, soft-spoken man who wears gold-rimmed
glasses, has turned the pages of musical scores for Aaron Copland,
Rudolf Serkin, Andre Watts, Leon Fleisher and Bella Davidovich and
hundreds of other musicians for nearly a quarter-century.
   He turned pages for opera singer Leontyne Price's accompanist at
a White House recital for President Carter. He's been a consultant
and resident page turner for the annual summer Newport (R.I.) Music
Festival for the past 14 years.
   He's a regular at concert series at the National Gallery of Art,
the Canadian Embassy, the Kennedy Center and the Library of
Congress in Washington. He has flown to New York and London to sit
at the elbow of concert pianists who insisted that only Elmer Booze
would do.
   An accomplished pianist himself, with music degrees from two
universities, Booze is content to labor in the shadows of the
keyboard giants.
   A colleague at the Library of Congress, where Booze works during
the day as a senior reference librarian in the music division,
proudly calls him ``a world-renowned page turner.'' Booze modestly
dismisses such extravagant praise.
   ``For me, it's a job that anybody can do,'' he said. ``But
apparently that's not entirely true. I've talked to pianists who
say they can't turn pages. It makes them very nervous.''
   By contrast, Booze sits on the edge of his chair with
unflappable ease as the pianist struggles through stormy
fortissimos and crashing arpeggios.
   ``Pianists want someone with them in their greatest moment of
need, when they've gotten to the last note on the page,'' he said.
   That's the moment when Booze shifts into a low crouch and, with
a lightning thrust of the arm, flips to the next page and returns
to his seat. His movements are so unobtrusive that one pianist
calls him ``the ghost.''
   A good page turner must be skilled in reading a musical score,
Booze says, and a rehearsal is helpful to become familiar with the
pianist's eccentricities.
   Does he memorize the score? (Chamber music is rarely played from
memory, Booze says.) Are the pianist's jerks and nods a signal to
turn the page, or is he simply getting carried away with the music?
Are the pages old and brittle? Do they stick together?
   Onstage, he says, a page turner should keep his eyes on the
music and maintain ``a certain decorum'' to put the pianist at ease.
   ``If there's panic in your eyes, you can believe the pianist
will panic, too,'' he said. ``The last thing he needs is a spastic
page turner.''
   Despite the page turner's best efforts, disasters do happen.
Booze recalls the nightmarish evening of the missing paper clip.
   His pianist had promised in the dressing room of the Kennedy
Center Concert Hall to insert a paper clip in the score of a
devilishly complex work by Franz Liszt for two pianos. At the point
when Booze was supposed to turn back 20 pages for a repeat in the
second movement, the paper clip wasn't there.
   ``It was something to behold,'' he said. ``He was going like a
bat out of hell. His arms were in my way and mine were in his,
trying to find the exact page. Both pianists stopped playing, and
the whole thing came to a screeching halt. It was not a good show.''
   Booze has left his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned during concerts ever
since he rose from his chair to turn a page for Aaron Copland and a
button popped onto the keyboard while the composer was performing
at the Library of Congress.
   Booze turned another anxious moment into a tour de force that
garnered the first and only ovation he has ever received from an
audience.
   When he and a pianist took their seats at the Newport festival,
they discovered that the piano's music rack had been removed and
was nowhere to be found. So Booze became a human music rack,
holding up photocopies of each page of the score.
   When the piece was finished, the festival president leaped to
her feet. ``Let's all clap for Elmer,'' she shouted, and the page
turner shyly emerged from the shadows to accept his acclaim.
