   Dave Stevens has an acute eye for art.
   He also has great acuity of vision _ 20-17 to be exact _ which
enables him to paint tiny portraits on grains of rice, watch faces
and the heads of pins.
   His miniature portrait of St. Louis Cardinal shortstop Ozzie
Smith on a grain of rice is enshrined in the St. Louis Baseball
Hall of Fame.
   Now his attention has turned to bigger things: portraits of
Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog on baseballs.
   ``Herzog has a banquet coming up at the end of May. I have to do
seven dozen portraits in seven weeks,'' he said, dipping a tiny
brush into a palette.
   The Alton artist painted 100 baseballs with Herzog's likeness
for the manager last year. Herzog auctioned them off to benefit the
YMCA.
   A baseball card serves as Stevens' inspiration and he creates
his art on a TV tray in his living room. It takes Stevens about one
hour to paint Herzog's portrait on the back of a regulation
baseball.
   ``I do it over and over so they're not identical, but I want
them as close as possible,'' he says.
   Stevens collects $25 per portrait, not including the cost of the
ball.
   He doesn't limit his subjects to baseball players or baseballs.
His favorite effort: a grinning Mickey Mouse on the head of a
straight pin.
   ``I've done portraits on old lockets and inside pocket watch
covers,'' he said. ``Once I took the crystal out and painted a
player in the batting stance on the face of a watch. I made the bat
on the big hand and the ball with all the stitchings on the end of
the small hand,'' he said.
   Steven's smallest painting is a skull and crossbones on the tip
of a paper clip for a motorcycle rider.
   ``I read the smallest painting in the world is on the head of a
pin, so I used the paper clip. The wire tip is as small as a shaft
of the pin,'' the artist said.
   Most of his ideas come from customers who want, for example, a
portrait of an anniversary couple on rice or a color drawing of a
favorite car encased on a belt buckle, Stevens said.
   Stevens began creating miniature art six years ago out of
boredom.
   ``It was one of those weekends in August when nothing was on TV
and I had been asleep on the couch,'' he said. ``I painted a scene
on a stone the size of a quarter and it snowballed after that.''
