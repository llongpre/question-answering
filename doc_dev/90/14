<LEADPARA>  LAST WEEK I mentioned that no one, no scientist or teacher, knows precisely
why the Earth behaves like a giant magnet. But we have learned a lot about
magnets in general, ever since our ancestors thousands of years ago unearthed
some strange black rocks that seemed to hold an invisible and mysterious power
over any particles or pieces of iron.;   The Greek philosopher Thales
(THAY-leez) was one of the first to study the properties of this mineral, and
since he obtained his samples from an area called Magnesia, he called the
mineral "magnes," from which we get our word "magnet" as well as the modern
name for this iron oxide, "magnetite."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In more recent centuries this material was known as "lodestone," which
meant a "leading stone," because when it was allowed to move freely, it would
point in a northerly direction, and so could "lead" ships on their proper
course.;   Having a compass and a bar magnet or two around the house is a
great way to tap your children's innate curiosity about the physical world,
and to encourage them to investigate and experiment with "hands-on" science as
well. It also provides parents a way to practice a set of behaviors that will
encourage children to learn for themselves.;   Amazing phenomenon the first
time;   The first time that children see a magnet pick up a thumbtack off a
table from an inch or two away, they will be amazed, but they will not have an
uncontrollable need to know the scientific explanation for this phenomenon.;  
Parents who launch right into a discussion of "lines of force" and "magnetic
poles" will miss the opportunity to have their children experience for
themselves the effect that this magnet has on a variety of materials. But if,
instead, you try the magnet on objects -- a wooden match, a paper clip,
various coins, some staples, toothpicks, safety pins, stamps, whatever is at
hand -- and preface each trial with a question like "What do you think will
happen if we try . . . ?" then your children will get a feeling for what
magnetism is. And, you will get a feeling for asking encouraging, open-ended
questions.;   We all have to make a conscious effort at developing this
questioning skill, precisely because it is so easy to lean in the other
direction and "tell" rather than "ask." Sometimes we phrase our questions so
that we are really "telling" instead of "asking" at all: "Isn't it true that .
. . ?" "Don't you think that . . . ?" or "Wouldn't it be better if . . . ?";  
Ask questions that lead to thinking;   These questions don't lead the child to
do any thinking at all, but questions that call for a prediction, and
questions like "What do you think is happening here?" certainly do. Let your
children feel the tug between two bar magnets, then turn one magnet around and
have them experience for themselves what the words "repel" and "repulsion"
feel like and mean. (How about repulsive?);   Hang a chain of paper clips or
tacks from the ends of your magnet. Can you make the same length chain closer
to the middle? How many will hang from the exact middle? "What do you think
will happen if . . . ?";   Have them see whether the magnet's power to move
tacks or clips will extend through various substances such as glass, plastic,
water and wood. "What materials do you think might block the magnet's power?";
  There are many books in the 538 section of the juvenile collection of your
library that will describe other experiments you and your children can do with
magnets and with a compass. There are no books, however, that will tell you
what questions to ask in each instance, but with a little practice, you won't
need them, either.  </TEXT>
