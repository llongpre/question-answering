   Taking a rare active role in an ongoing
federal investigation, President Reagan told top law enforcement
officials Thursday to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get the
facts in a burgeoning Pentagon fraud investigation.
   Reagan, who told Congress two years ago that he did not want
lawmakers ``scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet'' in the
defense budget, was described by spokesman Marlim Fitzwater as
``very concerned'' about allegations of bribe-paying and kickbacks.
   ``I think we're all aware of the wide scope of this
investigation,'' Fitzwater said, ``and it certainly poses an
internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that
have to be dealt with forthrightly.''
   ``I'm just not at liberty to expand on any of the details,'' he
said when asked to elaborate.
   Federal investigators armed with evidence from two years' worth
of wiretaps and this week's coast-to-coast raids are preparing to
approach witnesses who now may be forced to cooperate in the probe.
   The investigation has turned up ``rampant bribery in the
government'' and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of
cars and payments of bills for government employees, Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican member of the Armed
Services Committee, said Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said Reagan believes this is a matter ``that deserves
his attention, and that everyone involved should know of his
feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds
of crimes that have been committed here.''
   Government sources familiar with the probe said searches of
offices of 15 defense contractors on Tuesday stemmed from wiretaps
on the offices of two top Pentagon officials. The bugs have been in
place for much of the two-year investigation.
   Reagan in 1985 created a commission to study ways to streamline
Pentagon operations. The panel, headed by industrialist and former
Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard, recommended a stronger hand
for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a new civilian
office to oversee Defense Department purchasing.
   The commission also recommended that there be less
``micromanagement'' of the Pentagon by Congress _ and Reagan said
he agreed with that.
   ``Instead of scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet,
Congress should give more thought to our overall defense needs and
strategy,'' he said.
   On Thursday, Reagan met with Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
FBI Director William Sessions and top Justice Department
prosecutors. He had met Wednesday with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   Reagan seldom has involved himself directly in investigations of
alleged wrongdoing, although he was interviewed by a commission
that probed the Iran-Contra affair.
   Fitzwater said the president had not been told about the
Pentagon investigation at its outset, but was not disturbed by that.
   ``The FBI starts hundreds of investigations that are carried out
over a long period of time. The White House is not aware of most,
if not all of, those investigations,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said ``there always comes a time when any
investigation, when it's presented to the Justice Department for
criminal action or whether it's presented to a grand jury for
possible indictment, it becomes known to the civilian authority,
whether it's the president or the head of the agency or the bureau
or whatever.
   ``I'm sure that in this case, it was simply their judgment that
this was the right time to make it known to the Defense Department
and the White House,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the president was ``satisfied that the bureau has
acted with the Naval Investigative Service quickly and effectively
and pursued this investigation.''
