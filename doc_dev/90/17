   FBI agents seized items that could be used to
make a pipe bomb such as those that killed a federal judge and
civil rights lawyer during a search of property owned by a man
convicted 18 years ago of possessing a similar bomb, a newspaper
reported.
   The Atlanta Constitution quoted federal sources it did not
identify in today's editions as saying laboratory tests are pending
to establish whether the items found on the property of Walter
Leroy Moody Jr. match the two bombs that exploded in December.
   Moody denied any connection with the bombs, his lawyer said.
   The bombs sent through the mail killed U.S. Circuit Court Judge
Robert Vance in Alabama and lawyer Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga.
Two other bombs were safely intercepted.
   Investigators confiscated 2{-inch pipe, six-penny nails, rubber
bands, alarm wire, flashlight bulbs, bolts, paper clips,
gunpowder-packed bullets and welding machinery _ all similar to
items used to make the mail bombs, the newspaper said.
   Also seized were adhesives, brown paper, labels, tape and
``old'' string, the paper reported. Similar materials _
particularly a unique string that has not been manufactured for
about seven years _ were used on the packages in which the four
bombs were mailed.
   The Constitution, in a story also copyrighted by The Atlanta
Journal, reported that agents seized the following:
   _Seventeen 25-cent ``flag over Yosemite'' postage stamps in the
pocketbook of Susan McBride, who lives with Moody. That stamp was
used on all four package bombs.
   _A desktop copier. Photocopied, typewritten letters from a
purported group calling itself ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System'' were sent after the bombings.
   _Highlighted newspaper clippings about the FBI's investigation
of Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, an Enterprise, Ala., junk-store owner
whose home and business were searched last month and who has been
questioned repeatedly. O'Ferrell denies any knowledge of the bomb
attacks.
   _Two typewriters that were examined on the scene and determined
not to match the ones used by ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System.''
   Moody, reached at his Clayton County home, referred inquiries to
his attorney, Michael C. Ford.
   ``I don't see anything there that I see as significant,'' Ford
said of the seized items. ``They found brown paper. Well, I hope
they don't search my office. I probably have some of that, too.''
   Ford said two motions were filed in federal court Monday seeking
the return of Moody's property and attacking the searches as
faulty. He said Moody has no connection to the bomb attacks.
   Moody, 55, a self-employed literary consultant, was convicted in
1972 of possessing a pipe bomb that the newspaper's sources said is
very similar to the December package bombs. He was acquitted on a
charge of building the bomb, which injured his then-wife, Hazel, in
their Macon, Ga., home.
   In his appeals in that case, court records show Moody was
extremely critical of the attorney, judges and government agents
associated with his case.
   During an interview Friday with WSB-TV, Moody said,
``Criticizing the court is not an unhealthy practice, I don't
think. I think it's unhealthy when you say, `If you don't rule my
way, then I'm going to send you a bomb.' That's ridiculous.''
   Moody served nearly three years in the Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary on the bomb possession conviction but maintains his
innocence. He is representing himself in asking the U.S. Supreme
Court to throw out his conviction after an 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals panel denied his third appeal in June. Vance was not on
that panel.
