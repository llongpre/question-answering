   In addition to the facts and figures formally
found in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988
features fun, in the form of a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the
most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said Tim
McClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agency
GSD&amp;M, which designed the report.
   The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95
million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from
the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble
Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out last year
during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texas
and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually
painted plane, with assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint:''
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''
   Even though Southwest previously has taken a light approach to
its reports, McClure said it was a little difficult this year to
sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, ``once someone
punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.''
   He said he persuaded Southwest that the unusual idea would
become enticing. ``Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up
for one.''
   ``I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really
shows the personality that Southwest is,'' McClure said.
   Southwest, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people,
is based at Love Field near downtown Dallas and operates a
distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.
