   A 22{-foot-tall paper clip was unveiled
outside a business college Monday to honor the Norwegian who
invented the office helper 90 years ago.
   The paper clip, weighing a desk-crushing 1,320 pounds, is a
faithful copy of Norwegian Johan Vaaler's 1899 invention, said Per
Langaker of the Norwegian School of Management.
   ``The paper clip is 100 percent accurate and fully functional if
anyone has big enough paper,'' said Langanker, 23, of the school's
student committee.
   The paper clip was made from steel tubing and is mounted on a
6-ton concrete base outside the institute in Baerum, an Oslo suburb.
