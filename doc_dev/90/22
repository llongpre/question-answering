<LEADPARA>  IT'S A sign of our comfort-seeking times: Since the '80s, the trend has been
to furnish work spaces with residential and personal touches. But a good third
of the nation's workforce, 35 million Americans, have decided to bring
business home.;   For parents, the option of full-, flex- or part-time work at
home is welcome. Early retirement has created another home-office workforce.
The personal computer boom has generated a wave of home-office wannabes, and
the advent of modems and faxes has further expanded the home-office network.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Corporations such as AT&amp;T are helping employees move their offices to
attics, basements or spare bedrooms. Some people are even forsaking their tax
deduction (the IRS requires a separate room for a legal deduction) and are
setting up offices in portions of living and dining rooms, master bedrooms and
master baths.;   Just five years ago, if you needed furniture to set up shop
at home, your choices were greatly limited. The focus was more on the
utilitarian -- a no-frills clerical look rather than executive.;   Today,
you'll find a range of pieces designed for home-office spaces. There are
drop-leaf, wall-mounted desks that can be installed in a kitchen corner and
can moonlight as mini-bars, as well as basic black laminate office systems
tucked into converted bedrooms. There are lateral file cabinets in a rainbow
of colors, even in marbleized and granite-look finishes. You'll also see
elegant mahogany desks and nail-studded leather chairs.;   You can create an
instant office by shopping in department stores; specialty stores, such as
Crate &amp; Barrel; or even in catalogs. Spiegel's fall and winter catalog
features 12 pages of office furnishings. J.C. Penney has a 16-page pullout.
And the 5-year-old Chicago-based Reliable Home Office, whose catalog reaches
10 million consumers, mixes standard commodities such as fax machines and
electronic Rolodexes with arts and crafts-inspired desks that double as dining
tables, glass-topped desks with Greco-Roman stonelike pedestal bases, chairs,
lamps, and snazzy supplies such as marbleized file folders, lavender legal
pads, neon orange paper clips and hot-pink staplers.;   Whatever space you've
designated as your home office demands the same design courtesy as any other
room -- especially if it's in a high-traffic, high-visibility spot.;   Of
course, the electronic age has brought challenges. Hiding the computer,
peripheral equipment and cables has become as much of a design challenge as
stashing away the television set.;   Much of the furniture designed specially
for computers has been, until recently, largely uninspired. Most of it fell in
the category of ready-to-assemble.;   "Some of these are so chintzy-looking
and badly designed that people wouldn't even put them in their basements,"
said one furniture executive. "They're looking for the same detailing and
hand-worked finishes they have in their other furnishings.";   However, things
are looking up. The down-sizing of computers and components is prompting
manufacturers to modify proportions and deliver more style.;   With its spring
catalog, J.C. Penney discovered that consumers are hungry for style -- desks,
chairs and cabinets whose design, finish and details wouldn't seem awkward or
inferior. A group of traditional executive-style furniture in cherry finish
with brass-finished hardwood was featured at $499.;   "The response surprised
us," said Patricia Treiber Shaw, home-furnishings consultant for the catalog.
"The group has done very, very well. There obviously is a need for people who
are working at home. They don't want to have ugly stuff sitting in a corner.
They want their furnishings to go with the rest of the home.";   Even the
styling of the basic desk chair has gone beyond the swivel. A recent model by
Girsberger Industries, for example, has a rounded silhouette and vivid red
upholstery. But it has more than streamlined form: A triple-jointed mechanism
allows the chair to move freely (it also can be locked into position), and it
has pneumatically adjustable height (a gas cylinder makes the adjustment at
the touch of a lever), all designed in an elastic material with a thinner
profile. It retails for $800 to $1,300, depending on materials and whether the
chair has arms.;   Still, some consumers say furniture designed for the office
is too hard-edged for the home and that residential furniture can't quite get
down to business, so they opt to customize their home offices.;   The results
can be smashing. Chicago interior designer Vassa started with an old-fashioned
banker's desk in an office she planned for a family in a contemporary suburban
home. But she gave it an non-traditional look with modern materials -- a
metallic laminate that matches the bookshelves that line two walls; the top is
inlaid with leather.;   Actually, a fabric was the starting point for the
design.;   "The geometric-pattern, with its metallic gray, bronze and zippy
blue, gave us an Old World flavor as well as a contemporary feeling," said
Vassa, who coined the term "hoffice" to describe this kind of space that she's
designed for eight years.;   Vassa makes sure there is adequate lighting,
always on dimmers. Both residential and contract office furnishings
manufacturers sell lighting. Task lighting in the form of a desk lamp is
essential.;   Halogens (those tiny low-voltage lights that are popular not
only for their sexy looks but because people like their white light), come in
a variety of architectural or sculptural styles with high-tech looks. Some
offer dimmers. There are classic banker's lamps, in brass or black, some
updated for halogens.;   Stylish home offices demand equally fashionable
accessories. That means everything from desk blotters to tape dispensers to
paper-clip holders, even the phone itself.;   "We've taken the approach of the
humanized home office," said Bette Frank Rosenberg, home fashion director for
Spiegel Inc. "It's important to bring a little personality into the home
office. Nobody likes to work in a sterile environment. Pretty picture frames,
fun executive toys (electronics, gadgets), small-screen TVs and, yes, even art
-- are very important. We want to offer a functional environment that's
organized, uncluttered and convenient, yet expresses someone's personality."; 
 So if you shop wisely, you'll soon be sitting pretty in your home office,
probably thinking, "There's no place like hoffice."  </TEXT>
