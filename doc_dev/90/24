Coming from South Africa to manage Berger Aus Berg, manufacturers of metal
drum closures in Peterlee, Co Durham, Richard Swart arrived with fresh eyes.
He was immediately aware of the UK's different seasons and dark winter
afternoons, plus the toll they take on energy consumption - not least of all
in his factory.
At the same time, Swart discovered that while environmental issues are not
as high on the South African agenda, in the UK his company was operating in
the packaging industry - which is acutely environmentally conscious. Linking
the need to tackle Berger Aus Berg's energy consumption with a need to learn
more about environmental issues, he decided it was time to review the
company's environmental practices.
Increasingly, companies are paying more attention to their environmental
performance. While many do it to ensure they are meeting UK and EC legal
requirements, others are interested in quantifying their environmental
impact and using the information to maintain good relations with their local
community, customers, suppliers or even investors. Companies which have
their sights set on achieving BS 7750 - a recently published British
standard for Environmental Management Systems - or other similar schemes,
know they must first set their house in order.
Ironically, when Hedda Bird formed Conservation Papers in Reading in 1988
the last thing she thought about was 'making the company greener than
green'. This was despite the fact that it was operating in an
environmentally conscious area, marketing recycled paper to the business
community. Yet within six months her attitude changed. 'Everyone - including
us - rapidly became much more sophisticated and knowledgeable about
environmental issues,' she recalls.
Three years later, Dorothy Mackenzie formed the London-based marketing
consultancy Dragon International, which is run on environmentally friendly
lines. 'We provide environmental consultancy,' explains Mackenzie, 'and to
have credibility with clients we needed to practice what we preached.'
Although all three companies have analysed their environmental practices,
only Berger Aus Berg has paid for an independent environmental review. Last
summer it commissioned Groundwork Foundation's Environmental Review Service
to see what environmental improvements could be made. The review took three
days with Groundwork - which is supported by the Department of Environment,
BP and the Countryside Commission - looking at energy use, waste management,
legal compliance, recycling and potential cost savings.
Swart has already implemented several of Groundwork's recommendations. For
example, it advised the company to reduce its energy consumption by altering
the factory's lighting. The factory had previously had to have all its
lights on when only half were needed. Swart expects future electricity bills
for lighting to be 50 per cent less and will recoup his investment within
eight months.
Groundwork also advised the company to take pallets and bags it receives
from suppliers and re-use them when sending products to its customers. This
it has done with impressive results. In the past, most transport packaging
costs were passed on to customers. By re-using packaging the costs have been
significantly reduced. Customers have been informed about this reduction in
charges.
At Conservation Papers, staff had been running the company along
environmental lines to the best of their abilities. However, in 1992 they
adopted a more formal approach and joined an Environmental Business
Challenge, launched by Reading Borough Council, to help companies develop
and implement an environmental policy. 'It gave us a structure to work
with,' says Bird, 'and most of the changes we've made have been as a result
of it.' In an attempt to reduce its energy consumption by up to 15 per cent,
Conservation Papers has taken some simple steps, turning down thermostats
and switching off heating at weekends.
'At Dragon International, Mackenzie and her colleagues assessed the
environmental impact of all they did from the first day. Setting the company
up, they purchased second-hand 'recycled' furniture - furniture which does
not contain tropical hardwoods, bought a photocopier for double-sided copies
and decided against supplying company cars. Staff are encouraged to use
bicycles or public transport.
The company buys recycled non-chlorine bleached paper, re-uses scrap paper,
re-cycles its paper and laser printer toner cartridges, fits long-life light
bulbs, uses environmentally sensitive cleaning equipment and supplies china
rather than disposable cups.
Being environmentally sensitive brings costs with it. Berger Aus Berg has
spent Pounds 600 on an electrician's bill and Pounds 150 on Groundwork's
fees. Conservation Papers spent Pounds 70 on automatic door closures. Dragon
International's main expenditure will be on better insulation and a more
efficient boiler for its offices costing several hundred pounds.
Although all the companies have spent several hours discussing environmental
practices with staff, none has found the process disruptive. 'Everyone
starts thinking along the same lines,' explains Mackenzie. Swart has seen
his employees change their attitudes. 'At first they were curious about the
review,' he says. 'Now they tell me what we can do to make further
environmental improvements.'
There are other benefits too. All the companies have reduced their overheads
by implementing energy saving measures and all expect to recoup the
investment within two years in lower energy bills.
Perhaps what is surprising is how many benefits have been gained through
relatively few changes. To a large extent these companies have simply made
sure their housekeeping is in good order - albeit under an environmental
umbrella.
Although none has gone out of its way to promote the changes, all the
companies expect that one day they will have to justify their environmental
practices. To that end they are continuing their environmental programmes.
EASY STEPS TO IMPROVING A COMPANY'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES
Review energy efficiency. Reduce consumption by turning down the thermostats
and turn off un-needed lights and equipment.
Encourage employees to re-use as much equipment as possible - paper-clips,
scrap paper, elastic bands, bull-dog clips etc.
See whether there are ways to reduce waste or generate a further income by
selling your waste as scrap.
Reduce vehicle use. Encourage staff to use public transport or walk. If
employees live locally, set up a company bike scheme.
Review purchasing policy. For example could you save money or improve your
public image by consider purchasing recycled paper. Only buy ozone-friendly
products and cleaning materials which are free of phosphates and are readily
biodegradable.
Reduce paper usage. Encourage staff to write on both sides of any paper and
use double-sided photocopies when sending long memos.
Recycle paper, glass, plastics and cans.
