FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: Cleaning up your act at work - A more effective
way to shuffle her papers

When you get to the office in the morning, do you make yourself a cup of
coffee and start sorting through a pile of papers? 'I must ring X about that
and I'll sort that one out later.' There are papers on your desk and more on
the floor.
In your drawer, along with an umbrella and a tin of shoe polish there are
more papers, but the important fax you were sent yesterday seems to have
disappeared.
It sounds like you do not know how to work. You are in good company.
Inefficiency is rife at all levels.
According to the OECD, productivity of white collar workers barely changed
in the 1980s despite the introduction of computers, while that of factory
workers rose by 75 per cent.
People are trained to do every other aspect of their jobs, but when it comes
to organising themselves they are usually left to their own devices.
Changing bad habits is not easy, but it is possible, according to Jay
Hurwitz of the Institute for Business Technology. His training company
claims to have made 40,000 office workers more productive using what is
grandly described as a 'Personal Efficiency Programme.'
Its ideas are so simple it is hard to believe that people pay good money for
them.
DO IT NOW
The PEP golden rule and a principle that even the most inefficient person
knows to be a good one.
However, simply saying those three words is one thing, living by them is
another. PEP graduates have impressed on them that if they Do It Now they
will
Handle things only once and so save time
Have fewer distractions and concentrate better
Catch problems while they are small
Not have to worry about not doing things or waste time explaining to others
why you have not done so
Once this has really sunk home, you can move to the next principle
GET RID OF CLUTTER
Clear out all your drawers and files. With each piece of paper ask yourself:
have I ever used it and do I reasonably expect to use it? If I throw it
away, and unexpectedly need it, will I be able to get another copy?
Create a 'reference' filing system for papers that pass this test, and
another 'archive' for things that you do not need, but have to keep for
statutory reasons.
Set up tree trays on your desk: In, Out and Pending. The last is not for
things that have been put off, but those that cannot yet be completed.
Use the middle drawer in your desk - or somewhere else close at hand - for
all current work. Divide the work into different projects, each in its own
folder.
Make sure that you have all the other things you need - from telephone
directories to paper clips - to hand.
PLAN YOUR DAY
Don't let yourself be a slave to the in-tray. According to some recent US
studies, managers receive five times as much information as they actually
need. Managers waste too much time reading unnecessary material and clog up
their filing systems with the rest.
Set up a new filing system for every day of the coming month. It should
contain all the relevant papers for that day's meetings and details of
delegated work that is due to be finished on that day. That way you do not
have to clog up your mind with things to remember.
Make yourself a realistic plan for the day-week of priorities for work, and
mark yourself off against them.
Delegate more. According to Hurwitz, most bosses spend 20 per cent of their
valuable time doing things that could be equally well done by their
secretaries.
Do not agree to meetings that are not likely to be useful to you, or that
will make it harder for you to meet your own targets for the week.
It is all easily said. But it seems habits can only be changed under duress.
The PEP team stand over each employee, breathing down their necks, to make
sure they really are throwing away the contents of their drawers.
One man had 20 cardboard boxes in his office containing the papers from
previous jobs. Persuading him to throw them out 'took three days and was a
very painful experience for that individual', says Hurwitz.
The trainers go back after a few weeks and then after a few months to keep
the pressure on. Each time they draw up a written contract against which to
mark the employee. But does it last? 'There is some slippage, but they do
not ever go back to where they started from,' says Hurwitz.
As for me, I was planning to clear out my desk drawers after my conversation
with Hurwitz, but I have not got round to it yet.
