   EDITOR'S NOTE - There is a fascination for some, usually the
doers of crossword puzzles and fans of Trivial Pursuit, in trifling
information. Here is a book of facts great and small, distilled
from millions of questions asked of the New York Public Library by
people who can't take ``don't know'' for an answer.

   In 1857, Elisha G. Otis invented the passenger
elevator. Fifteen years after that William LeBaron Jenny designed
the first skyscraper, a 10-story structure.
   Naturally, someone had to invent the elevator before someone
could build a skyscraper, but the same year that gave us the
skyscraper gave us the commercial electric fan. Cool.
   If these seemingly distended historical tidbits attract you,
then leaf through the New York Public Library's Desk Reference, a
book full of surprises. It is based on the more than 5 million
questions the library and its 82 branches answer each year.
   Vartan Gregorian, former president and chief executive officer
of the library, writes in his preface, ``...unlike annuals and
almanacs that need revising and updating each year, the Desk
Reference (Stonesong Press, $34.95) holds a considerable amount of
true reference information, unchanging basic facts and background.
   ``We also hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to
browse through.''
   It is.
   For instance, if you know that Thomas Alva Edison invented the
phonograph in 1878, you will be pleased to know that L.O. Colvin
invented the milking machine the same year, and James J. Ritty
invented the cash register the year after that.
   These were heady times, a veritable cascade of brainstorms. But
read further. Every year was like that.
   For instance, last year was the 110th birthday of the hearing
aid, and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button. It was also
the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway.
It was the 90th anniversary of the paper clip.
   This year is the 100th birthday of the flashlight (by England's
Bristol Electric Lamp Co.), the aluminum boat (by Switzerland's
Escher Wyss &amp; Co.) and the zipper (by Whitcombe L. Judson). So much
for the snap button.
   The Desk Reference has less esoteric fare. It tells you how to
write your congressman, how to call toll-free for rental cars and
hotels. There are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere
from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe.
   There is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and how to
play board games from backgammon to Scrabble or cards from
blackjack to solitaire.
   There is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols, from
extinct animals to semaphore, from etiquette to legal forms, from
animal first aid to a directory of poison control centers.
   More than an almanac or a book of world records, it is a settler
of arguments. Take religion. The book says there are 648 million
Hindus, 18 million Jews, 840 million Muslims, 158 million Orthodox
Catholics, 307 million Buddhists, and 5.6 million followers of
Confucius.
   In the United States, there are 31 million Baptists, 2.7 million
Episcopalians, 13.5 million Methodists, 2.8 million Mormons, 8
million Lutherans, 700,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.
   But worldwide there are 900 million Roman Catholics, the largest
Christian Church in the world. It takes 6{ pages to list all the
popes.
   It takes only a line to inform you that Mary Phelps Jacob
invented the brassiere in 1914.
   One thing that strikes the reader is how long ago some of the
inventions sprang from the human mind. Another is, what in the
world did mankind do before they came along?
   A third is that, with so many minds at work, progress is
inevitable.
   We were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by
unknown gunsmiths.
   We got eyeglasses from Alessandro de Spina in 1285 and lip
reading from Alexander Melville Bell in 1866 and the telephone from
Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 and the hearing aid from R.G. Rhodes
four years later.
   In 1855, we got the stopwatch from Edward Daniel Johnson, 345
years after Peter Henlein gave us the pocket watch.
   In 1862, we got the machine gun from Richard Jordan Gatling and
a year later TNT from J. Wilbrand. In 1867, Alfred Nobel gave us
dynamite a dozen years after we got the safety match to light it.
In 1867, we also got barbed wire from Lucien Smith.
   Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier gave us the hot
air balloon in 1783, 14 years before Andre Jacques Garnerin came up
with the parachute. What balloonists did in the interim is not
explained.
   The metal cannon was introduced in 1326 by Rinaldo di
Villamagna, the spirally grooved rifle barrel in 1520 by August
Kotter, the portable shotgun in 1525 by the Marquis of Pescara.
   It was not until 1540 that Ambrose Pare invented artificial
limbs. That was offset the same year by Camillo Vettelli who
invented the pistol.
