</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernie Rooney is the ultimate organization man. 
</P>
<P>
His shoes shine. His suit, tie and shirt look crisp. His personal calendar and 
office calendar, which always are at his fingertips, are penciled in perfectly 
and don't have messy scraps of paper and business cards falling out of them. 
</P>
<P>
He is on time. When he gives a seminar, he hands out neat yellow name cards. 
His reference materials are lined up tidily in front of him. A small, 
unobtrusive clock that he sets before him keeps him on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He is enough to drive the average white-collar worker, who is a disorganized 
mess, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is with the paper police. As chief financial officer and a trainer for 
the Institute for Business Technology, a consulting firm that promises to 
increase white-collar productivity by getting people to organize themselves and 
their work, he has forced hundreds of Washington area office workers, managers 
and executives to do the unthinkable: Throw out their paper, reports, 
loose-leaf notebooks, memos, yellow stickums, ancient phone messages, useless 
magazines and dusty old issues of the company's revised employee handbook. 
</P>
<P>
He has gotten them to stop ignoring their voice mail and return phone messages 
immediately. They have stopped putting off big projects and now use the "salami 
technique," taking a small bite out of them every day. Their desks have three 
trays on them: "In," "Out" and "Pending." The "In" tray is not overflowing with 
mail from three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
They now have a file system that separates work into three categories: working 
files, research files and archives, which are removed from the office. The 
super-organized set up what Rooney calls "tickler" files to remind themselves 
of what they have to do that day. They set up "action plans" to persuade 
themselves that they will live by Rooney's rules of neatness and cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
And, those who become true disciples of IBT's personal efficiency program, or 
PEP, learn to scour their desks clean to the point where they have only one 
thing in front of them to work on. Their mantra is "Do It Now." Instead of 
putting off things that they hate to do, they "Do the Worst First." 
</P>
<P>
"Reorganization isn't the purpose of the program," said Rooney. "We come in to 
get you focused on your job. But you can't do it if you are disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Improving the productivity of office workers is one of the truly important but 
difficult challenges confronting business. Although productivity -- hourly 
output per worker -- has declined throughout the business sector since the 
early 1970s, the slump in the service sector has been worse than in 
manufacturing. Boosting the efficiency and productivity of "knowledge" workers 
in an information-age office is a lot harder than for assembly workers in a 
production plant. 
</P>
<P>
To attack this problem, IBT charges $4,000 to put seven people through its PEP 
program, which includes a seminar, an office cleaning and follow-up visits to 
make sure what has been learned is applied. Then IBT comes back for surprise 
visits that span a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole goal of the program is to get you to be more efficient with the 
least amount of effort," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing the Personal Efficiency Program has been relatively simple. IBT, 
which was founded in 1983 in Stockholm by marketing consultant Kerry Gleeson, 
plays on guilt and workplace truisms such as "Are you always short of time?" or 
"Do you work extra hours to catch up on what you don't do during normal hours?" 
and "Do you have too much to do?" 
</P>
<P>
IBT promises that once a hanging-file system and a decent desk calendar become 
part of its employees' work lives, companies can achieve bigger objectives such 
as improving quality, offering better customer service, reducing costs or 
weathering a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to get people to produce, not teach time management," said Gleeson, 
who thinks his technique will do for white-collar workers what assembly lines 
have done for the blue-collar world. 
</P>
<P>
IBT, which has $3.25 million in sales and has put 200,000 people through the 
program in Europe, came to the United States two years ago. Gleeson hopes to 
franchise his idea beyond the offices he has already opened in Washington, 
Boston and Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of managers and middle managers haven't the foggiest idea 
about how to work," said Gleeson, confiding that the secret to his success has 
been getting others to work. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, despite the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, looked like a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a definite need in Washington," said IBT's Rooney. "It's a 
work-driven environment. Everybody is crisis-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
This morning at 8:30 sharp, Rooney has seven victims from Contel ASC in 
Rockville, Md., a provider of data communication networks, sequestered in a 
sunny conference room for the kickoff two-hour seminar and video. 
</P>
<P>
He lets them in on a few secrets, like 80% of your work is in 20% of your 
files. He promises that file drawers that now are stuffed too full to open will 
be half empty by the time he gets through with them by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
PEP participants are relieved of their regular duties for the day, and are 
advised not to take or make phone calls. Their bosses have been told not to 
bother them. Management has been advised to stock the supply room with plenty 
of trash cans and hanging file folders. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know what is about to happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anyone know what they are in for today?" Rooney asks with a smile. "We're 
known as desk busters. You're going to do it and I assist. Or if you don't do 
it, I do it for you." 
</P>
<P>
It's the ultimate in the invasion of workplace privacy. This is not like other 
time-management or executive-organization seminars where someone politely 
suggests that the key to being more productive at work is to make lists and 
delegate. 
</P>
<P>
This is Rooney doing hands-on housecleaning of desk drawers, files and offices. 
This is Rooney checking back not once, but several times, to make sure you have 
straightened out your work space, that you plan ahead and that you set goals. 
</P>
<P>
He acts like your friend, but he really is your mom. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 a.m. he gets down to business in the small, somewhat claustrophobic 
office of financial analyst Vicki Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, one of 72 Contel employees who have gone through PEP training, was 
voted as having the messiest office. She came prepared in blue jeans to fight 
overflowing files and the messes left by her predecessor in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield already uses three trays. She has a calendar, a Rolodex and a stapler. 
Not much is stuck up on the bulletin board. Then Rooney pulls out her top left 
drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"What are all these?" he asks quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"All the materials from my quality training," Hatfield says, looking guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney pulls a Spiegel catalogue out of the drawer. "Don't keep anything 
horizontal in a small drawer," he says, dropping the catalogue in the trash 
can. 
</P>
<P>
He turns to the top drawer of her desk. "That's not bad. Everything is 
contained," he mumbles, automatically disentangling binder clips, paper clips 
and rubber bands that are jumbled together. 
</P>
<P>
He starts pulling out files. "The point is to get everything out," he says, 
creating a mountain of manila folders on Hatfield's desk that begins to fall 
over and spill out paper. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield looks pained. "I'm normally a very organized person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30, it's over, at least until after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't dump your file cabinets until I get back," Rooney instructs on his way 
out to another mess down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney keeps asking each employee, "How do you feel so far?" as if he is 
guarding against nervous breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He warns them not to go to extremes on their first day because in his fight 
against procrastination and paper overload, Rooney has seen it all. One 
Washington executive had IBT in for a marketing presentation. His office was 
spotless. Not a thing out of place on his desk. Rooney and Ira Chaleff, 
managing partner for the Washington office, wondered why someone with such a 
neat office needed them. 
</P>
<P>
Then the executive took them down the hall to his real office, revealing that 
he was a closet slob. 
</P>
<P>
The key to IBT's success, says founder Gleeson, is that people are not left to 
face their messes alone. They get someone like Rooney to spend time with them, 
trying to figure out why they put reading material in their briefcases and then 
never read it. Or why they keep dozens of interoffice envelopes stuffed into 
bottom drawers. Or why they can't ever part with anything. 
</P>
<P>
"If I clean my office out it won't look like I do anything," said Contel 
treasury assistant Michele Brice, coming up with one of the classic excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney, who considers himself a sort of personal trainer in efficiency, has 
observed that if people are left to their own devices, no more than 40% 
"initiate action when I tell them to get in there (and clean it up)." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said about 75% of the people who go through the program get some 
benefit. The most basic pay-back is saving time: You save eight full days over 
a year if you pick up just 15 minutes a day at work that you wasted in 
meaningless actions such as picking up the same piece of paper 10 times before 
you act on it -- which is the average. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought some organization to the madness," said Thomas Veystrk, vice 
president of human resources for Jos. A. Bank Clothiers in Baltimore, which put 
10 of its top managers, including the company's president, through the PEP 
program recently. 
</P>
<P>
The hope was that managers would use their time more effectively and be able to 
juggle a number of projects at one time without losing control. 
</P>
<P>
Contel brought in IBT to help with a reorganization in its finance department 
and to complement an in-house program that stresses improving quality. 
</P>
<P>
"People are better able to plan and set priorities," said Margaret Brady, 
Contel vice president of finance. "As we bring new people into the company, we 
get them trained. It's only effective if everyone talks the same language." 
</P>
<P>
And the language is fairly simple. It boils down to three little words that can 
transform you from a person who has piles of files on your desk to one who has 
working files, research files and archives. 
</P>
<P>
"Do It Now," said Rooney.
