   Economists and traders are bracing for a period of adjustment as the government returns to seasonally adjusting the monthly merchandise trade data. 

   But seasonal factors or not, the consensus view holds that the April trade deficit due out tomorrow widened, backtracking a bit on recent progress. 
The average estimate of 10 economists in a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report poll called for a seasonally adjusted $12.20 billion gap, up from an adjusted $11.95 billion gap in March. 
Another survey, conducted by Redwood City, Calif.-based MMS International, puts the median view at $12.3 billion, seasonally adjusted. 

   "I think April will be a significantly higher trade deficit than March any way it's measured. 
But I don't think it will be a disaster," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. 

   Economists believe the U.S. is making progress on easing the trade imbalance but some are tempering their optimism on the time frame, based on the Commerce Department's recent release of seasonally adjusted trade numbers going back nine months. 

   The government issued the historical data last week in preparation for returning to seasonal adjustments it stopped in December 1985 because of time lags in gathering data. 
The new system's later deadlines permit more figures to be gathered. 

   The seasonally adjusted historical data shows "less and later" improvement in the trade gap, notes Mr. Sinai. 
He and others point out that without the retroactive adjustments, trade started to improve in the third quarter of last year. 
With the seasonal adjustments, the narrowing in the gap begins this year and is somewhat smaller. 

   For instance, the March deficit originally slid to $9.75 billion from $13.8 billion the previous month -- a drop that cheered stock, bond and currency markets. 
But under the new seasonally adjusted figures, March's deficit slipped only to $11.95 billion from $14.41 billion in February. 

   Even if the return to seasonals helps smooth month-to-month carry-overs from numbers that slipped through the cracks or were in error, there are still plenty of other items to complicate the trade series. 

   Consider March. 
Part of the reason the deficit is expected to grow in April is because of the absence of big gold shipments to Taiwan. 
In a masterful accounting gimmick, cash-rich Taiwan bought huge amounts of gold in March, in an effort to cut its U.S. trade surplus before sitting down to trade talks. 
Taiwan, which normally imports less than $50 million of U.S. gold a month, is believed to have purchased over $700 million in March. 
By booking the gold as a commodity -- instead of a cash substitute -- Taiwan was able to artificially improve its trade balance. 
At the same time, it "helped" total U.S. export accounts. 

   Despite the often-murky mix of numbers that go into calculating the trade deficit, economists do believe the U.S. is making headway in shrinking the gap. 
A recent survey of business economists showed they expect the trade deficit to decline to $150 billion this year and $125 billion in 1989. 
The deficit was a record $170.3 billion last year. 

   There is considerably less agreement on the course of inflation. 

   Stock and bond markets rallied last Wednesday on a downturn in commodity prices. 
The Commodity Research Bureau Index dropped along with the barometer, as the promise of rain eased inflation fears in the grain belt, or at least in the grain trading pits. 

   But while agricultural commodities were falling, industrial commodities were rising. 
The Journal of Commerce Industrial Price Index, which tracks spot prices for 18 sensitive materials, broke above 100 last Tuesday for the first time since last September. 
A reading above 100 means average industrial input prices are exceeding levels for 1980, the index base year. 

   "We have some really bizarre differences here," says Robert S. Gay, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
But he's sticking with the industrial price trend, noting those "prices are far more fundamental." 

   Demand for industrial materials is likely to continue steady for a while. 
The May industrial production report due out Wednesday is expected to show an increase again, although at a slower rate than the previous month's jump. 
Industrial output rose a robust 0.7% in April, helping push the capacity utilization rate up to 82.7% that month. 
Economists say the May operating rate is likely to hold around that level if, as expected, output rises a bit. 

   The May report on retail sales is expected to look somewhat stronger than the previous month, which suffered from an early Easter. 
In April, retail sales slipped 0.6% to $131.58 billion, largely because the important Easter buying season came unusually early this year.

   SAVE THOSE PAPER CLIPS: Office product prices are likely to rise about 3.8% over the next six months, marking the biggest jump since 1982, according to a survey by Quill Corp., an office products distributor in Lincolnshire, Ill. 
At an annualized rate, that means costs could rise 7.6% for the rest of the year. 
Last year, prices rose 2.4%. 
Rising paper and steel costs are the main culprits as those industries operate at high capacity to meet high demand. 
"Paper is constantly going wild," says Jack Miller, Quill president.
