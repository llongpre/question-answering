<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA defense contractors are enjoying the largest sales tax rebate in
state history: $810 million and growing. Their enjoyment is short-lived,
however, since they have to hand the money over to the federal government.;   
Last year a state appeals court ruled that contractors don't have to pay sales
tax on certain purchases they bill directly to the feds. The court reasoned
that when contractors buy paper clips, toilet paper, equipment and other
supplies, those items become government property at the moment of purchase.
And since the federal government is tax-exempt, the state can't charge sales
tax on them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Of course, contractors have been paying sales tax for years and tacking it
on to the cost of government contracts. In effect, the feds have been
subsidizing local governments by allowing them to collect the tax.;    But no
more. The court ordered the state to stop collecting the tax and refund taxes
paid in prior years. The contractors will then readjust their contracts and
send a check to the feds.;    For California cities, which are increasingly
dependent on sales tax revenue, this ruling is costly. The city of San Jose
expects to pay at least $2 million in rebates. Sunnyvale says the ruling will
mean at least $1 million in rebates and $400,000 each year from now on.;   
There may be a way to get the money back. Tennessee, Alabama and other states
levy a "use tax" on contractors. The way it works, the state taxes the use of
the materials, regardless of who owns them. These taxes have been upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court.;    Why didn't California pass a use tax years ago?
Because state officials thought they would win the appeals court case, and
besides, no one realized how much the state had to lose. Now as estimates of
the tax refunds owed by the state continue to mount, officials are kicking
themselves. More important, they are writing legislation to enact a state use
tax.;    We urge them to act swiftly. The money the U.S. government receives
from this tax exemption won't even scratch the federal budget deficit. But it
will mean major surgery for local governments.  </TEXT>
