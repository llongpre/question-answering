<LEADPARA>  This is not exactly the golden age of learning in California. Overwhelmed by
cutbacks, schools are resorting to all kinds of measures to bolster meager
coffers.;    In Mountain View, school officials are thinking like corporate
officers. The school district is asking folks to buy symbolic "shares of
stock" in the schools' programs. Call it Mountain View Elementary, Inc.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here's how it works: If you like a particular program, you can "buy" some
shares of that program. The $5 shares won't bring you any monetary gains. The
dividend, in this case, is a thank-you note, and the knowledge that you've
supported the schools. It's a twist of the old "adopt a pet or a tree"
fund-raiser.;    The district needs money to sustain programs in music, fine
arts, technology, physical education and the libraries.;    As education
budgets shrink, schools are relying more and more on parents for financial
support. In Mountain View, where 80 percent of the residents don't have kids
in school, money is hard to come by. "We can only sell so many cupcakes to
parents," said Mountain View Assistant Superintendent Trish Bubenik.;    The
district is looking to trim $1.46 million off its $12 million budget for the
1991-'92 school year. And things that generations of students took for granted
are now in short supply. Among the items the schools are soliciting from the
community are: pencils, paper clips, binders, correction fluid, outdated
stationery and letterheads. "It's just a shame," said school board member Judy
Yates. "A ream of paper for the copier is becoming a big deal.";    It seems
education is no longer a right, but more a privilege.;    If you'd like to
help, please ring Bubenik at (415) 968-6945.;  POSTCARD CAMPAIGN: It's an
exercise of grass-roots campaigning, with a mix of environmental zeal.;   
Gov. Wilson wants to set up a California Environmental Protection Agency. But
a public-interest research group, called CalPIRG, said the governor's plan
doesn't include a pollution prevention program. So volunteers are going door
to door to seek support for the inclusion of a pollution prevention program in
a proposed state agency.;    CalPIRG would like to give structure to the
proposed agency, said CalPIRG's Julie Duncan. The campaign's goal is to make
prevention a priority. The Legislature is entertaining three bills that would
strengthen environmental protection in the state.;    AB 1519, by
Assemblywoman Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, would require companies to report their
total use and production of chemicals.;    AB 251, by Sen. David Roberti,
D-Los Angeles, would require companies to provide data of their chemical uses
and production to the public and would coordinate and enforce pollution
prevention efforts.;    AB 46, by Sen. Art Torres, D-Los Angeles, would
classify 189 chemicals as toxic air contaminants and would seek to reduce
their release into the air. Currently, only five chemicals are identified as
such.;    CalPIRG volunteers and staffers are asking residents to send
postcards to the governor and to their representatives. The goal is to talk to
40,000 residents in the Palo Alto area this summer, Duncan said. For more
information, call CalPIRG at (415) 323-5364.  </TEXT>
