   That green stuff you see the next time you
open the refrigerator might not be last week's meatloaf.
   Reynolds Metals Co., the people who brought you Reynolds Wrap and
Reynolds Plastic Wrap, has introduced colored plastic wrap.
   The clear, clingy stuff will now be available in red, blue,
yellow and yes, green.
   The company's advertising says the new wrap, which costs the same
as its clear counterpart, ``makes the mundane task of wrapping
leftovers fun.''
   ``The addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic
wrap, which in its clear form is considered purely a functional
product,'' said Reynolds brand manager Jane D. Nims.
   Marabel Morgan, author of ``The Total Woman,'' who has advocated
that women add excitement their marriages by greeting their husbands
at the door wearing only in plastic wrap, says the colored wrap ``is
a great idea. It would really add a lot of zip,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Miami.
   Crystal Color Plastic Wrap generated lots of enthusiasm in focus
groups and simulated test markets, said Anne F. Waring, a
spokeswoman for Reynolds' consumer products division.
   ``Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting,''
she said, noting that the same thing has been done to paper clips
and rubber bands.
   The company will promote use of the colored wrap in crafts as
well as food storage, Ms. Waring said Monday, and will have several
special promotions around the holidays.
   Ms. Waring declined to speculate on the impact the colored wrap
might have on sales or how much the new product, which has been in
the works three to fours years, cost to develop.
   The consumer products division accounts for 10 percent of
Reynolds' sales, she said.
   In 1988, Reynolds reported a record net income of $482 million,
or $8.35 per share, on revenues of $5.6 billion.
