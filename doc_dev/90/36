   Doctors removed nearly a half-pound of
razor blades, paper clips and metal bedsprings from the stomach of
a prison inmate who swallowed the metal in a suicide attempt.
   Surgeons operated on Carl Rhoades, 32, on Friday, a prison
official said. Rhoades swallowed the metal on March 13.
   The 7{ ounces of metal was thought to have caused a gastric
ulcer but no other damage, said Les Harmon, associate director of
the Kansas State Industrial Reformatory in Hutchinson.
   Rhoades initially refused surgery so prison officials got a
court order allowing them to authorize it. He eventually signed the
consent form.
   The prisoner was recovering at a Hutchinson hospital. The
nursing supervisor at the hospital said Sunday she could release no
information about his condition.
   Rhoades was convicted of aggravated battery last year for
shooting a motorist during an argument. He was sentenced to 10 to
20 years in prison.
