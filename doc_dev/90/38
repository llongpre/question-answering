   Westinghouse Hanford Co. said it suspended four employees
indefinitely without pay in connection with an intentional
silencing of an alarm panel at a nuclear facility.
   The company, a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp., said
last week an engineer found a paper clip wedged in the alarm
panel, preventing six alarms from sounding. The alarm was at
an evaporator, used to reduce the volume of nuclear waste
stored in underground tanks. The facility has been shut down
since the mid-1980s, but still houses equipment used to
monitor some underground nuclear waste storage tanks.

   Westinghouse said it was the third such incident at
Hanford in less than six months. Investigations of the other
incidents didn't determine who was responsible or why the
tampering happened. The company, which manages facilities for
the Department of Energy, is continuing its investigation.
