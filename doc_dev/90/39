DO NOT be over-impressed by business travellers who appear glued to their
laptop computers on long journeys. They might just be curled up with a book.
The Voyager company, of Santa Monica, California has developed software to
enable Apple Macintosh users to call up pages of books on the screen. By
pressing a key the pages are turned over and notes can be added
electronically to the margin or sections highlighted. There is even an
electronic paper-clip to make a specific page easy to locate.
Particularly intended for those who have bought the latest Powerbook laptop,
the discs display illustrations as well as text. One of the first three
books to be put on to disc is Martin Gardner's annotated 'Alice in
Wonderland', including illustrations.
Sound can also be incorporated. With Michael Crichton's book 'Jurassic
Park', for example, when a dinosaur is mentioned the reader can click the
name and a picture appears - along with the sound the animal might have
made.
