<LEADPARA>  HER name isn't Heloise, but her ideas could have the same kind of kick -- with
a '90s twist toward recycling.;    Vicki Lansky is Family Circle magazine's
HELP! (Handling Everyday Life Problems) columnist. Her new book, "Another Use
For . . . 101 Common Household Items," includes such ideas as using egg
cartons as "stuffers" for boots to prevent tops from flopping onto the closet
floor. She also says used egg cartons can help organize drawers by providing
cups for nails, money, paper clips, etc.  </LEADPARA>
