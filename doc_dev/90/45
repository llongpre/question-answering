<LEADPARA>  We are what we eat, buy and use and, in the eyes of four West Valley cities,
what we throw away.;   The four cities -- Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Campbell
and Saratoga -- are the subject of a recently-released study examining
residents' garbage habits, right down to the rotten food, smelly pet cans, old
love letters and x-rated magazines they throw away.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The study was done in the interest of developing future programs for
reusing waste to reduce the strain on the environment.;   What it bore out was
hardly a surprise to waste program officials: one-third to one-half of what
the tree-studded cities toss out is yard waste. And between one-quarter and
one-third of what they toss is paper -- from newspaper and computer paper to
magazines.;   "I was not surprised at all by that," said Vera Dahle, who is
coordinating the solid waste study for the four cities. "It did underscore the
importance of beginning now to evaluate yard waste collection services for at
least the residential sector," she said.;   One of the cities -- Saratoga --
already is scheduled to begin collecting grass clippings and other yard waste
at residential curbs next April. The three other cities are considering
similar programs but have not approved them, partly because they were awaiting
results of the study.;   The third most popular castaway noted in the study
was the entire category called "organics." Food, tires and rubber waste, wood,
agricultural residue, manure, textiles and leather were included as organics.;
  The study also looked at what the commercial and industrial sectors throw
out, revealing that commercial businesses toss out a large quantity of paper
products, which include corrugated cardboard, computer paper and other paper.
Between 40 and 50 percent of what they toss is paper.;   About one-quarter of
what they toss is food products and other organic material, which also was not
a surprise to officials because of the large number of restaurants in the West
Valley cities.;   Among the cities, Campbell residents showed they toss out
more yard waste than Monte Sereno and Los Gatos. Saratoga officials declined
to provide any figures.;   Nearly 49 percent of what Campbell residents dump
is yard waste. Forty percent of Monte Sereno's garbage is yard waste and
nearly 30 percent of Los Gatos' refuse is tree and grass clippings.;   In Los
Gatos, 33 percent of trash is paper products; in Monte Sereno, 29 percent
thrown out is paper, and in Campbell, one-quarter of what residents toss is
paper.;   Research for the garbage study involved workers poring through
dozens of refuse bins -- piece by piece -- at the Guadalupe Landfill. Workers
sorted through soiled diapers, gooey rags, slimy wrappers, rotten food and
maggot-ridden dog food cans.;   The study by solid waste consulting company
Cal Recovery Inc. of Hercules was conducted during 10 days in July.;   All the
cities have curbside recycling programs for newspaper, glass, aluminum and
corrugated cardboard. But, Dahle said, the new study hopes to illustrate the
need for the cities to develop more recycling services.;   Dahle said the
garbage profile and other information she is gathering on waste reduction will
be combined into a larger report that will go to the cities early next year.
After that, it's up to the cities to act on new programs.;   All California
cities are under a state mandate to analyze their waste stream and propose a
plan for future disposal or recycling by the end of this year.;   The state's
solid waste law, passed in 1989, says all cities must come up with plans to
reduce the amount of garbage sent to landfills by 25 percent by 1995 and 50
percent by the year 2000. The penalty for not meeting the goal: $10,000 a
day.; Garbage cans; Here is what a consultant's study shows West Valley
residents throw away.; (box)Campbell: Nearly 49 percent of what residents dump
is yard waste; 25 percent paper products; 13 percent organics such as food,
tires and rubber waste, wood, agricultural residue, manure, textiles and
leather.; (box)Los Gatos: 30 percent yard waste; 33 percent paper; 18 percent
organics.; (box)Monte Sereno: 40 percent yard waste; 29 percent paper; 18
percent organics.; (box)Saratoga: City officials declined to release figures.;
