<LEADPARA>  YOU would think the shower area, which gets daily doses of warm water, soap
and shampoo, would stay naturally clean. Not so.;    Mold, mildew, soap film
and other stains mar surfaces, and mineral deposits clog shower heads.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here are some tips to help keep shower stalls or tub showers clean and
clog-free.;    (check) What's the best time to clean your shower? Right after
using it, when steam has loosened the dirt. Just wipe off the damp surfaces
with a paper towel.;    (check) Remove mildew from the grout between ceramic
tiles by wetting the surfaces with water and then spraying them with a
solution of 1 cup bleach to 1 quart water. Scrub the grout with an old
toothbrush.;    If the grout is grungy-looking, clean it with full-strength
vinegar instead. Caution: Make sure the room is well ventilated while you do
the job and that towels and fabric shower curtains are out of range of the
spray.;    (check) Wipe away soap spots or film from tile with a solution of
water and water conditioner, or a solution of one part vinegar to four parts
water. Rinse, then dry with a soft cloth.;    (check) Stained tub or tile
surfaces come clean with a paste made of cream of tartar and hydrogen
peroxide. Spread the paste over the stain and scrub lightly with a brush. Let
the paste dry and then wipe or rinse it off.;    (check) If you're tired of
cleaning around non-skid decals in your porcelain tub or shower, scrape them
off with a single-edge razor blade (in a holder) dipped in soapy water. Remove
adhesive residue with acetone or nail-polish remover.;    (check) Unless the
care label indicates a shower curtain is machine washable, wash it in the
bathtub with warm water and detergent. Hang the curtain on its hooks to dry.
If the curtain can be machine washed, put in two or three large towels to
balance the load. To remove soap film, add a half cup baking soda to the wash
water. To keep the curtain supple, add a half cup vinegar or a few drops of
mineral oil to the wash water.;    You can remove mildew from a bleachable
shower curtain by sponging it with a solution of one part chlorine bleach to
eight parts water. If the fabric cannot be bleached, spread on a paste of
baking soda and gently rub the curtain before washing.;    (check) To unclog a
shower head, remove it from the wall pipe by using a pair of pipe wrenches
with jaws wrapped with tape to avoid marring the chrome. Use one wrench to
hold the pipe steady while you turn the collar of the shower head with the
other. Disassemble the shower head and soak the parts overnight in full
strength vinegar to soften mineral deposits. Then scrub the parts clean with a
stiff brush. Use a toothpick or an unbent paper clip to poke debris and
mineral deposits from the shower holes.;    (check) If your shower head has
seen better days, it might be better to replace it. Consider one that has a
non-clogging plastic face plate or install a water-conserving head or one that
delivers a pulsating flow or has a hand-shower attachment. To install a new
head, simply remove the old head. Wrap pipe-sealing tape (available at
hardware stores) around the pipe threads. Then screw the new shower head into
place.  </TEXT>
