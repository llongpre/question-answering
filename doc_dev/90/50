   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The San Francisco Chronicle has lost a
fight with the Internal Revenue Service over the newspaper's
claim to a $2.9 million tax deduction for donating its
clipping files to charity.
   The U.S. Tax Court, in a decision filed Tuesday, agreed
with the IRS that the 7.8 million clippings dating back to
1906 were not property which, if sold, would have created
capital gains.

   The finding that the clippings qualified as ordinary
income property limited the deduction to the newspaper's
basis, or cost, of producing the files. Although the files
cost more than $10 million to create, the Chronicle's basis
in the property was zero, because the cost had been written
off as an ordinary business expense.
   The ruling apparently left the newspaper and its parent,
Chronicle Publishing Co., liable for back taxes totaling $1.3
million for the years 1983 through 1985. The court also
rejected the Chronicle's argument that the deduction
limitation applied only to individuals, not to corporations.
   In deciding against the newspaper, Judge Theodore
Tannenwald Jr. said it may well be that similar clippings
should be considered a capital asset when contributed to
charity. But that issue, he added, is a policy question in
the jurisdiction of Congress.
   The Chronicle had reproduced its clippings on microfiche
before giving them to the California Historical Society.
