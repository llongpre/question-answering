It is 10 o'clock on a Saturday morning and the 650-space carpark outside
Costco's Clifton warehouse, on the New Jersey fringes of New York city, is
filling up.
The building itself is nothing out of the ordinary: it is just one of
several featureless sheds on a business park off the expressway. The
attraction is the goods on sale - or more particularly, the price tags they
carry.
One man coming out of the warehouse is pushing a trolley stacked with car
tyres and tins of motor oil. He is a local taxi driver named Brett Lines,
and he has just spent Dollars 240. But he says the same goods would have
cost a third more anywhere else. 'I just saved close to 80 bucks.'
Howard Myers, a metal dealer, has spent Dollars 237.19 on an assortment of
food, car accessories, electrical appliances and household goods. 'I have no
idea how much I saved,' he says. 'But I came in here for some dog food and I
came out with a vacuum cleaner and a hairdryer.'
The inside of the cavernous warehouse is austere, but brightly lit and
clean. Goods are stacked on pallets laid out on metal racks. Fork-lift
trucks move continually up and down the aisles, replenishing supplies as
fast as the customers exhaust them.
More than a third of the 117,000 sq ft floor space is devoted to food and
household supplies. The rest is taken up mainly by electronic goods (desktop
computers, television sets, audio equipment and white goods), office
furniture and supplies, do-it-yourself equipment, clothing and toys.
Warehouse clubs make their money by selling large quantities of a limited
number of lines. Even so, the variety is wide: goods range from paper clips
(Dollars 20 for 2,000) to grandfather clocks (Dollars 999.99 for one). Other
products include Huffy 18-speed mountain bikes at Dollars 129.99, janitors'
brooms at Dollars 4.79, men's underpants at six pairs for Dollars 8.99, and
the Bible at Dollars 25.
Food and drink sells mainly in bulk: sugar, for example, is sold in 50lb
bags for Dollars 15.49, Hellmann's mayonnaise comes by the gallon at Dollars
7.19, cans of Green Giant asparagus spears come in six-packs costing Dollars
8.99, and Budweiser beer is sold in 24-can cases at Dollars 10.49.
Shopping at Costco is for members only, but it is easy to get in. Anyone in
business can buy a membership card for themselves at Dollars 30 and six more
for employees, friends or relatives at Dollars 15 each. Membership is also
open to all public sector employees and their partners.
Costco says 60 per cent of its sales are to business customers, but it is
clear that many people are buying for personal consumption even when using
their business cards. So are conventional stores feeling the pinch?
John Zuza, manager of the A &amp; P supermarket half a mile down the road, seems
unconcerned: he says his sales have risen since the warehouse opened last
year. 'Most of our business is small orders,' he says. 'Costco is fine if
you have a big family or you're having a party, but most people don't want
to buy 24 rolls of paper towel at a time.'
He may be right. Even so, back at Costco, there are plenty of people like
Jerry Marrone, a postal worker, and his wife, Joan, who have driven 20 miles
to stock up on food and household goods.
Mr and Mrs Marrone say the Dollars 95 they paid for their booty was less
than half what they would have paid elsewhere.
Joan Marrone delves into their trolley-load of goods and produces a pack of
chocolate chip muffins. 'You go in a normal bakery and a muffin that size
would cost you Dollars 1,' she says. 'We have got 12 for Dollars 3.99. You
just can't beat that. Britain is going to love this store.'
