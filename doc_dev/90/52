<LEADPARA>  IF YOU go to all the trouble -- and expense -- of taking photos and having
them developed, you should do what you can to keep them safe.;    First and
foremost, select an album that will protect your photos rather than ruin them.
Richard Bauer, assistant conservator at the Redding Museum of Art and History
in Pennsylvania, said magnetic albums and those with vinyl pockets can
actually damage photos.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Mostly, albums with vinyl coverings emit oxidants that will accelerate the
deterioration of the surface of photographs," he said. A prime offender is
polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Photos stored in plastics made with PVCs will yellow
or deteriorate in time, Bauer said.;    Karen Roberts, a consultant, said
photos placed in magnetic albums showed signs of deterioration in less than 10
years.;    Family historians should be wary of the magnetic-type album, said
photographer Tom Gallagher. "Sometimes people choose albums out of convenience
and aren't aware of the impact of the storage on their prints. I realize (the
magnetic albums) are very dominant in the marketplace, and they're very
convenient, but, ooh, they're not too good.";    Magnetic albums, which work
by gripping photos on sticky cardboard with plastic overlays, have the
potential to ruin photos. Toxins in the glue and cardboard and some plastic
materials threaten photos. Plastic enclosures made of archival-quality
polyester (either Mylar or Melinex), polypropylene, triacetate or polyethylene
are considered safe for photos.;    "It's hard to distinguish between vinyl
and good coverings, but there are companies that deal with archival
materials," Bauer said.;    The safest scrapbook-type albums are of acid-free
paper, which may be available at camera stores, art supply stores or through
catalogs that sell archival-quality materials.;    If mounting photos on
paper, use a product such as Grippit paper cement or rice paper glue. Special
archival-quality transparent mounting corners are available.;    Vanita Ulch
of Redding, who has a framing business, said including newspaper articles
(which are high in acid and lignin) in a scrapbook can contaminate photos and
other items and speed up deterioration. Either slip the clipping into a
high-quality polyester sleeve or have a copy made of the article.;   
Newspaper clippings may be copied by having a photomechanical transfer (or any
similar process) made at a print or photo typography shop or camera graphic
establishment. Be sure to say you want the copy to be archival so steps will
be taken to prevent it from fading or discoloring. The copy then can be
included in the album and the original stored elsewhere for safekeeping.;   
Photos should be kept out of direct sunlight and away from high or low
humidity. Don't store albums in attics or basements, where temperatures can
fluctuate drastically.;    Albums are best placed in a vertical position,
rather than horizontal.;    Finally, negatives should be stored in a cool,
dark, dry place, Bauer said. Keeping them in the refrigerator is one option.
Negatives should not be kept with the photo album. If something happens to the
album, the negatives also will be destroyed or damaged.  </TEXT>
