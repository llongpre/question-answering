   A jury began deliberating the fate of Oliver
North today, after one of the alternate jurors who sat through his
criminal trial said of North's role in the Iran-Contra affair: ``He
knew it was wrong.''
   ``No one said `if you don't do this we're going to fire you,'''
alternate juror Horasina McKie told CBS News, addressing one of the
central points North used in his defense _ that all his actions
were authorized by superiors.
   Ms. McKie, among the five alternates excused from the panel
Thursday, said she thinks President Reagan knew about North's
activities.
   ``I believe Mr. Reagan knew what was going on,'' she told CBS.
``I can't say he knew everything, but I think he knew enough to
know what was going on. I mean, you see (national security adviser
Robert) McFarlane every week, he's only 100 yards from you or feet
from you.''
   Reagan told the Tower commission on Jan. 26, 1987 that he did
not know that the National Security Council staff was engaged in
helping the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   During two hours of deliberations this morning, the jury sent
out requests to the judge for more copies of the jury instructions,
pencils, writing paper and paper clips. They also asked when lunch
would be, saying through an emissary that ``we want to get on a
schedule.'' Lunch will be at noon each day.
   Ms. McKie's comments addressed a central point North has used in
his defense.
   The former White House aide testified that he had authorization
for all his actions in the Iran-Contra affair, including allegedly
obstructing Congress by denying that he was assisting the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   ``Mr. North ... wasn't made to do what he did,'' said Ms. McKie.
``He had a choice in it. He had a choice to either say `No, I don't
want to do this' or `yes sir, I will do this' even as it went along
and he knew it was wrong.''
   That remark addresses criminal intent, a question that will be
central to the jury's deliberations.
   Ms. McKie said she would have voted to convict North on some
charges, acquit him on others, but she emphasized she had not
discussed the case with other jurors and thus could not say how
they felt.
   If convicted on all 12 counts against him, North could face
maximum prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of $3 million.
   North testified that he had no idea any of his actions violated
the law and that he had good motives for what he did.
   He said he destroyed a ledger showing how he had spent $300,000
in cash on orders of CIA director William Casey because the
document contained names of Contras leaders and that exposure could
have endangered their lives. North is accused of illegally
converting $4,300 from the $300,000 cash fund to his own use.
   The jury foreman, Denise Anderson, 34, presides over a group of
nine women and three men chosen for their task 2{ months ago
because they were among the few Americans who hadn't watched, read
or heard anything substantial about North's televised testimony in
1987.
   Ms. Anderson, a hospital employee, was picked for the jury after
telling lawyers: ``I don't like the news.''
   In two hours of instructions Thursday, the 12 jurors were told
to consider only in a narrowly defined context North's assertion
that all his actions were directed by higher-ups including
President Reagan .
   ``Authorization requires clear, direct instructions to act at a
given time in a given way,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell.
   ``It must be specific, not simply a general admonition or vague
expression of preference.''
   Gesell said ``neither the president'' nor North's bosses ``had
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law.''
   At the same time, the judge encouraged the jury to consider the
atmosphere of secrecy that pervaded the Reagan administration in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Emphasizing that ``our country is governed by the rule of law,''
Gesell said others ``ranking above or below'' North may have
engaged in the same kind of conduct he did.
   ``Some have pled guilty to charges, some await trial, some are
dead, others have received immunity in exchange for testifying,''
said the judge. ``This evidence was admitted so you would better
understand the atmosphere in which, and the circumstances under
which the defendant was working as these may bear'' on North's
intent.
   North's defense that his bosses gave him the go-ahead for
everything he did could apply to as many as eight of the 12
criminal charges against him. However, the judge's instructions
likely will curtail its importance in the jurors' deliberations.
   Gesell emphasized a number of points that could be favorable to
North.
   The judge pointed out conflicting evidence over whether a
proposed congressional resolution of inquiry was pending or not
when North lied to the House Intelligence Committee in 1986. In the
Aug. 6, 1986 session, North denied he was assisting the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels. One congressional committee had already voted down
the resolution.
