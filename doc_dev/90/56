Postmaster Jennifer Willis wears a blue smock of her own choosing. Because 
rural postal employees don't get a uniform allowance, they can pick their own 
work clothes, within reason. 
</P>
<P>
Her glasses are held together with a paper clip. She doesn't use much makeup, 
and she wears her brown hair long and straight. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, roughly a dozen people have visited the single window in the small 
cube of a building that serves as Palomar Mountain's post office. Willis, 47, 
knows every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
She has lived and worked on the mountain 22 years. After years as a clerk, she 
was made postmaster 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There's no home mail delivery on Palomar Mountain. Willis' postal branch has 
228 post office boxes, two-thirds of which are rented. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar Mountain isn't a place for people who need to be entertained. There is 
no movie theater, although the local store rents videos. The only restaurant is 
a vegetarian place owned by the Spiritual World Society. The nearest pizza 
joint is 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
There's no cable television. "They just use our mountain to bounce their 
signals off of," Willis said. And there's no newspaper delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea of a perfect day off is to spend the day at home," Willis said. 
"Sundays, I generally catch up on my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Peace and quiet are the primary attractions here. 
</P>
<P>
Her job occasionally stretches to include tasks unknown to an urban postmaster, 
like the time she weighed a newborn baby on her postal scale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably stay until I get too old to gather firewood," said Willis.
