   Rodney Dangerfield made a real-life demand
for respect Monday in court, receiving a trial date in a lawsuit
accusing a hotel chain of using his querulous voice for commercials
without permission.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian scheduled a pretrial
hearing Sept. 11 and trial Oct. 17 unless Dangerfield and Park Inns
Inc. of Dallas can reach a settlement.
   Dangerfield's lawyer, John Lavely, said outside court the comic
is adamant about pursuing the case in which an impersonator
mimicked Dangerfield's voice on a radio commercial for the hotel
chain.
   ``Rodney believes in this case,'' said Lavely. ``The case poses
the question of whether someone can do a satire of a famous person
and get the benefit of something someone has spent their whole life
developing.''
   In Dangerfield's case, he said, the entertainer has spent a
lifetime developing a unique voice, style and remarks such as, ``I
can't get no respect.''
   Attorneys for Park Inns argue they have the right to satirize
any famous person and note that their commercial, which began
running in the summer of 1988 and has since been discontinued,
contained a disclaimer saying that celebrity voices were
impersonated.
   Dangerfield was not in court Monday, but he said in his
complaint that the disclaimer was insufficient and contained an
additional comment which suggested the disclaimer itself was a joke.
   The complaint noted that the voice impersonator chimed in after
the disclaimer with, ``You mean this guy ain't a real announcer? He
really had me fooled. He sounded so good.''
   Dangerfield and his Paper Clip Productions claim damages ``in
excess of $10,000'' on each of five causes of actions plus punitive
damages.
   Dangerfield claims that Park Inns made substantial profits as a
result of using his voice and deprived him of the chance to sell
his name and likeness for such endorsements.
   ``If there were 50 of these (commercials) on the air, Rodney
wouldn't be able to get arrested,'' said Lavely.
