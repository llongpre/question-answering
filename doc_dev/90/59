<P>
Among the rubber checks and forged contracts that handwriting expert James 
Black keeps in his files, there's a letter written in swirling script that 
reads: 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about all those nights we spent in front of the fireplace 
in my apartment . . . Just six months until you're a daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
The wife who intercepted this romantic missive from her husband's mail hired 
Black to find out whether the writing belonged to a woman she suspected of 
having the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Black compared the note with writing samples the wife had pilfered from the 
suspected mistress. He concluded that the scripts did not match up, leaving the 
wife to search for a new scribe. 
</P>
<P>
As an "examiner of questioned documents," Black is more accustomed to dull 
business transactions that dangerous liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is usually pretty dry," Black says. "I don't see blood or gore. I see 
the writing." 
</P>
<P>
He works with seven police departments in Orange County and two in San 
Bernardino County detecting forgeries and fraud in documents. Most of the 1,200 
cases he handles a year involve bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, though, Black will get an intriguing case, such as that of a 
young chemist and weightlifter from Fullerton accused of manufacturing steroids 
in his home. The chemist kept voluminous notes on each batch of steroids he 
concocted, rather like a Julia Child's of hormones. In a criminal court case, 
Black examined the cookbooks and identified the chemist as the author. 
</P>
<P>
In another drug-related case, Black was summoned by an attorney defending a 
woman who had been found by police locked inside her hotel room with a large 
amount of cocaine. The police also discovered an incriminating "buy and owe" 
sheet with the names of customers and how much they owed for the merchandise 
written in longhand. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she didn't know about the coke and the notes weren't written by her," 
Black says. 
</P>
<P>
Black compared the suspect's penmanship with the log and told the attorney he 
believed she had written the notes. At her attorney's suggestion, the woman 
pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Black works in his El Toro office, surrounded by the tools of his trade: a 
magnifying glass, microscope, copier and a computer that can enhance poor 
writing samples. His father, David, taught him the business 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's handled thousands of civil and criminal cases as well as 
private disputes. 
</P>
<P>
He knows little about the cases stuffed in his files. His involvement is 
limited to issuing an opinion on whether a signature is forged. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, he's given checks written on accounts that have been closed or don't 
have enough money to cover the amount. 
</P>
<P>
"A checking account holder will deny having written the check. He'll claim his 
wallet was stolen, and who's to say otherwise? If the police suspect he's 
lying, they need the clout to say, 'You wrote a rubber check.' " 
</P>
<P>
Black gives them that clout. He compares the signature on the check with those 
on the account holder's bank application forms, driver's license and bank 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
"In a genuine forgery, the best I can do is rule out the account holder. It's 
harder to trace who wrote the forged signature," Black says. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, trace a cashier's check made out to cash for $1,000 to a 
high-ranking executive in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
To identify a forgery, Black studies the signatures under magnifying glass or 
microscope to see if they have all of the known characteristics of the true 
author's handwriting and no unknown characteristics. He'll look to see how the 
letters are formed, whether they're short or fat, round or square, straight or 
slanted. He'll study how the author crossed a "t" or dotted an "i." 
</P>
<P>
A forged signature usually lacks the spontaneity of a genuine John Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at your own signature. It flows. It has a naturalness. It's not halting 
or tremulous," Black says. 
</P>
<P>
"Forgeries are pictures of signatures. They're slow and shaky. The tremor of 
your deliberateness will be there" if you fake a signature. 
</P>
<P>
On one suspected forged check, for instance, he noticed three breaks between 
the letters of the first name and three more in the last. The account holder's 
known signatures contained just one break in each name, between the capital and 
small letters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to studying penmanship, Black examines all kinds of documentary 
evidence, including the kind of paper used, the typed letters, the ink and even 
the staples. 
</P>
<P>
Black recently examined a will of an elderly woman who had left a generous sum 
to her live-in boyfriend. Her family thought the sum to be too generous, and 
called on Black to examine the will. 
</P>
<P>
The document was four pages long and typed. Black concluded that her boyfriend 
had used the same typewriter and paper to type up two different middle pages 
and substitute them in the will, "leaving him much richer." 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend had not counted on the original staples rusting. Nor did he count 
on a paper sleuth such as Black counting the rusty holes -- four in the first 
and last pages, but curiously, only two through the middle pages. 
</P>
<P>
He might have been a rich man, if the deceased had used a paper clip.
