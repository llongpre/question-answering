<HEAD>Ban On Jailhouse Smoking Has Inmates Fuming</HEAD>

   One year after smoking was outlawed in
the Josephine County Jail, the inmates are fuming, but the jailers
are smiling.
   Jail Commander Mark Dickson said inmates are fighting less and
are much healthier since cigarettes _ jailhouse currency for
generations _ were taken away.
   ``In fact, I have had far more inmates come up to me since this
was issued and thank us for the policy, because it forced them to
quit smoking,'' Dickson said Tuesday.
   Inmate Ron Wise wasn't one of them.
   ``It's unconstitutional deprivation, in my way of thinking,'' he
said. ``The sheriff has taken it upon himself to decide what's good
for us.''
   Dickson said the jail was the first in Oregon to outlaw tobacco,
but others have followed suit. He estimated 95 percent of the
inmates smoked when they entered jail.
   Inmates found smuggling in tobacco aren't punished; the goods are
merely confiscated, Dickson said.
   Blackened electrical outlets are evidence that some cigarettes
are getting in. Inmates who can find something to smoke but don't
have matches put a paper clip in the outlet, then draw a spark with
another paper clip, Dickson said.
   One inmate was so desparate for a smoke he rolled herbal tea in
toilet paper and lit up, the commander said.
   With cigarettes out of the way, the jail is cutting back on
caffeine. Coffee with caffeine is no longer available at lunch and
will soon be gone from the dinner table.
   ``I think we have an obligation to maintain the healthiest
environment possible,'' Dickson said.
