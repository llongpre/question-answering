   Police who shot and wounded an escapee
recognized him as the man they shot and wounded five years ago in
the arrest that sent him to prison.
   Both shootings came at the end of wild chases that resulted in
wrecks after the man fled across the same bridge.
   Before the latest incident, Robert E. Reichman, 37, was
handcuffed to other inmates in a van taking them to court
appearances Wednesday at the Escambia County Judicial Center in
Pensacola.
   Reichman apparently used a paper clip to unlock his handcuffs
and then fled. Officer Bill Ogle fired two shots at the escapee but
missed, said Capt. Bob McFann of the Escambia County Department of
Corrections.
   While Ogle guarded the other inmates, security officers gave
chase on foot.
   The escapee fled through an alley and pulled courthouse employee
Carol Smiley from her parked car.
   ``Ma'am, I got to use your car, I got to use your car,'' Ms.
Smiley said the man told her.
   Reichman then drove across a three-mile-long bridge over
Pensacola Bay and into Gulf Breeze, authorities said. Gulf Breeze
police joined the chase.
   A tire was blown out when the car hit a curb and the vehicle
then skidded into a guide wire on a utility pole, said Gulf Breeze
Police Chief Jerry Brown.
   He said Detective Robert Barnwell fired three shots when
Reichman jumped from the car. Two of the bullets struck him.
   Reichman was in stable condition Thursday at University Hospital
in Pensacola. He was admitted with gunshot wounds in the left leg
and buttock.
   In November 1983, Gulf Breeze Officer Curtis McFee, who now
works elsewhere, tried to stop Reichman for a traffic violation.
   Reichman fled across the same bridge but in the opposite
direction and wrecked his car. He exchanged gunfire with McFee, who
wounded Reichman in the eye and leg.
   Reichman was then convicted of bank robbery, attempted
second-degree murder of a police officer and other crimes.
   He was being taken to court Wednesday for resentencing after an
appeals court overturned his original 25-year term on technical
grounds.
   Reichman now faces additional charges of escape, grand theft of
an automobile, fleeing police officers and resisting arrest.
