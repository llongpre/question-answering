  [Text] Kingston (NICA) -- Two Jamaicans, who died recently 
in Panama from an overdose of cocaine they were smuggling into 
Jamaica by swallowing it in plastic packets and condoms, have 
been identified. 
  Narcotics Police Division sources say they are David 
Sylvester Foster, 29, a higgler, who died on December 9 at the 
Aruba Hotel in Panama City, while preparing to catch a COPA 
flight to Jamaica. 
  Autopsy report shows that he died from an overdose of 
cocaine 
after a packet in which he had ingested the drug burst in his 
stomach. 
  The other victim has been identified as Yvette Tores, who 
died at the airport in Panama City on December 16. She fell ill 
as she was about to board a COPA flight for Jamaica and later 
died. 
  She too died of cocaine overdose when the plastic wrapping 
in 
which she swallowed the cocaine burst and poisoned her system, 
local Narcotics Police Division source said. Her body and that 
of Mr. Foster are still in Panama. 
  And an autopsy done at the Cornwall Regional Hospital in 
Montego Bay on December 22 on the body of Mrs. Sonia 
Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover, revealed that she too 
died of a cocaine overdose. When on December 9, she collapsed at 
Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay, aboard SAM flight 
506 on its arrival from San Andres, Colombia, five packets of 
cocaine were found in her brassiere. 
  The post-mortem examination on Tuesday showed that she had 
78 
packets of cocaine in her stomach. Also, an empty plastic 
wrapping was found in her stomach, indicating that it had come 
loose and the cocaine in it had killed her. 
  Cocaine experts say that "mules" hired to smuggle cocaine 
into Jamaica in their stomachs, usually swallow between 1 lb. 
and 1 1/2 lb of the drug. Medical experts roughly estimate the 
death-producing dose of cocaine to be 1.2 grams, but much 
smaller doses have been known to cause fatalities. A gram is 
roughly equivalent to the weight of a paper clip. When cocaine 
is ingested it disrupts the heart rhythm and depresses the 
respiratory centre, causing immediate death.
