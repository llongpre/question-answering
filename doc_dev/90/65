CARCLO Engineering Group, the Leeds-based card clothing, wire and
engineering products group, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in
profits and earnings and stronger order intake in the past three months.
Interim pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 3.68m in the six
months to end-September on sales up 5 per cent at Pounds 40.7m.
Earnings per share jumped from 4.9p to 6.3p and the interim dividend is
increased by 5 per cent to 1.8p.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the group was expanding its wire division and
was moving the card clothing operation.
The group finished the period with Pounds 3m of net cash, a position which
is likely to prevail at the end of the year.
The core card clothing division - which grew from the traditional family-run
wool-carding industry in Yorkshire in the last century - increased profits
by 46 per cent. On sales of Pounds 9.8m boosted by an acquisition in
Belgium, operating profits rose to Pounds 1.5m. Part of the increase
followed a greater level of sales to OEM manufacturers which bought very
little in the same period in 1991.
Mr Ewart said this relatively inexpensive product had a high gross margin;
any increases in sales fed quickly through to the bottom line.
Profitability in the wire division jumped by 78 per cent to Pounds 800,000
from a low base. In particular Joseph Sykes Brothers, which makes
nylon-covered wire for products like the bindings of notebooks and
paper-clips, remained a strongly growing market.
Carclo has decided not to sell Bruntons, a maker of wire rope products,
having failed to negotiate a satisfactory price. This company lost Pounds
300,000, a Pounds 100,000 improvement over the previous period.
The general engineering division enjoyed a 27 per cent increase in profits
to Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 11.5m. The division benefited from sales
of cable controls to companies such as Ford and Vauxhall and from strength
in bronze and aluminium components, but the remainder of the division faced
difficult trading conditions.
