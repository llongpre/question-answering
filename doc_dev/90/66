   Defense and many domestic programs would be
shredded if the $60 billion to $100 billion in automatic spending
cuts that the Bush administration says may soon be necessary
actually take place, analysts say.
   Administration and congressional leaders plan to begin
negotiations next Tuesday aimed at working out a budget deal for
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   Should they fail, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will
trigger spending slashes that White House budget director Richard
Darman says will be in the $60 billion to $100 billion range from a
spending plan totaling $1.23 trillion.
   ``Neither Congress nor the administration would contemplate cuts
in that realm,'' Robert Reischauer, director of the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office, said Wednesday. ``It's not even in the
realm.''
   Lobbyists agreed.
   Ellen Nissenbaum of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,
which advocates programs for poor people, said a $100 billion cut
would mean that 172,000 pre-school students could lose their spots
in the Head Start program. About 2.3 million poor and elderly
Americans could be dropped by another program that helps them pay
their utility bills, she said.
   ``It would be politically unpalatable across the board,'' she
said.
   Reischauer calculated the effect of a $97 billion cut next year
_ the amount CBO believes may be necessary. He said that would work
out to 24.7 percent cuts in eligible defense spending and 37.2
percent reductions for affected domestic programs.
   Even $60 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts ``would require reductions
in defense that were nonsensical from a foreign policy perspective,
and would be damaging to domestic programs,'' Reischauer said.
   The overall U.S. economy also would be badly wounded, analysts
said. Cutting federal spending by $100 billion would take that
amount away from corporations, members of the public and other
beneficiaries of government programs.
   As the economy cooled, the government's tax collections would
drop, its payments to the unemployed and the poor would rise and
the deficit would move upward again, Reischauer said.
   ``You would see a slowdown to virtually a stall'' in the
economy, he said.
   Many in Washington believe it will never come down to automatic
cuts of the magnitude Darman is suggesting. They predict that a
budget agreement will be reached by negotiation or the Gramm-Rudman
law will be changed to reduce the amount of savings that are needed.
   If not, however, the Gramm-Rudman cuts would be highly
noticeable to the public.
   ``People who make safety inspections of food and inspections of
the workplace wouldn't show up,'' said Reischauer. ``Thousands of
businesses that sell pencils and paper clips and Stinger missiles
and computers to the government would suddenly find their business
is off dramatically.''
   The Gramm-Rudman cuts would not apply to every program in the
budget.
   In defense, money the government has already committed to
contracts cannot be slashed. Therefore, out of the $290 billion
defense budget, about $190 billion would be subject to the
reductions.
   Nearly three-fourths of domestic programs would also be exempt
from Gramm-Rudman cuts. These includes Social Security payments,
interest on the debt and many federal retirement and veterans'
benefits. Many other programs, including Medicare and guaranteed
student loans, are subject to only limited cuts.
   That means that programs vulnerable to cuts would be hit hard.
   They would include many initiatives in which the government is
building for the future. Education, public housing, science and
highway construction all would be affected.
   ``You'd find entire agencies firing half their staffs,'' said
Stanley Collender, who follows the budget for the accounting firm
Price Waterhouse.
