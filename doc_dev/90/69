<HEAD>Historical Society Begins Computer News Index Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Omaha World-Herald is donating $150,000
to help start an electronic index of its clip files to be made
available to the public.
   The Douglas County Historical Society installed eight computers
on June 13 for its ``Living Morgue.''
   Roger Reeves, curator of the historical society, said the clips,
which fill three rooms, will first have to be preserved.
   ``When we first got them, they were crunched into small
envelopes. We'll unfold them and put them into acid-free files to
deter any more aging. Those that are too delicate will be
photocopied on acid-free paper.''
   During the second phase, Reeves and a staff of five will enter
brief summaries of each story into the computers, which will be
accessible to colleges and public libraries statewide for a fee.

   Publication of the monthly Nyssa Gate City
Journal has been suspended, general manager Jim Allison said.
   Owners Ted and Kay Grossman, now living in Washington's Puget
Sound area, had tried to sell the paper for about five years,
Allison said.
   Allison said the paper, with a monthly circulation of 1,500,
lost money for several years. The last issue was published May 23.

<HEAD>Striking Journalists Publish Own Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalists stood on street corners hawking
a newspaper they published on their own after launching Norway's
first newspaper strike in 44 years.
   The 32-page tabloid Avisa, the Norwegian word for newspaper,
appeared on June 11, a day after wage negotiations collapsed. It
competed with regular newspapers that succeeded in publishing thin
editions that day.
   The Norwegian Union of Journalists had ordered strikes at eight
major newspapers and the national news service NTB. Norway's
publishers association responded by locking out reporters from 57
other newspapers.
   In all, about 2,000 journalists were on strike or locked out.
   Employers offered less than half the journalists' demand of a
4.57 percent increase on their $34,460 average annual salary,
reports said.

<HEAD>Serbian Journalists Complain of Bias in Belgrade TV News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent journalists' groups in
Serbia complained of bias in Belgrade TV coverage of an
anti-Communist rally and demanded criminal charges be brought
against the Communist director.
   ``We consider that television reports before, during and after
the opposition rally ... represent a drastic violation of
journalistic ethics,'' said a statement released June 15 by
Belgrade Television's independent employees union.
   More than 30,000 people from the one-party state of Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, demonstrated in Belgrade on
June 13 demanding free elections and an end to Communist rule in
their state.
   The main rally ended peacefully, but police later used clubs to
disperse demonstrators who went to the TV station to demand
coverage of their demands and the resignation of Dusan Mitevic, a
Communist official appointed to head the state-run TV last year.
   Belgrade TV and Serbia's state-run press have described the
rally as ``a betrayal of Serbia'' and its participants as ``fascist
hooligans.'' They demand a purge of reporters from Belgrade's
independent radio station, which gave comprehensive coverage to the
event.
   A similar protest about coverage was made against the newspaper
Politika, an outlet of Serbia's ruling Communists, by 37 Politika
reporters. Its story June 14 on the rally was headlined, ``The
Anti-Serbian Gathering Was Unsuccessful.''
