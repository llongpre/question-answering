Multimedia technology has the potential to spawn large new markets in
entertainment and education, but a battle between copyright holders and
multimedia publishers threatens to obstruct the emerging market.
Multimedia developers see great potential in the use of CD-Rom discs to
store thousands of audio, video, graphics and text clips. Organised as an
interactive encyclopedia, adventure game or as a multimedia history of
Christopher Columbus, for example, they become powerful educational and
reference tools, allowing users to steer through enormous amounts of
information easily and quickly.
But developers of such applications complain that copyright holders are
asking large fees for the use of small snippets of existing audio or video
from tape and film libraries and that the copyright licensing process is
complex and time consuming.
In turn, copyright holders are worried about the integrity of their work,
which when transformed into digital form can very easily be copied or
modified. Writers, film-makers, artists and photographers fear they might
lose control of their works and their ability to collect future royalties.
The US Office of Technology Assessment has recognised the problem. In a
report issued last year, it warned that the development of multimedia
programs could be hurt by current copyright regulations that are not well
suited to the new technologies.
Multimedia title developers say they are willing to pay for copyright
clearances, but simply locating copyright holders is a big problem. Warner
New Media, for example, when developing a multimedia title on the Berlin
Wall, wanted to use a clip from the musical film West Side Story. This
involved obtaining and paying for copyright clearance from the film company,
the musicians, the music composer, the actors and the writers. But Warner
missed a copyright, held by the choreographer, and could not use the clip.
One loophole some multimedia developers have successfully used is the 'fair
use' provision of US copyright law. This allows use of a copyrighted work
'for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
including multiple copies for classroom use, scholarship, or research'.
However, US courts have interpreted fair use in unpredictable ways. Last
year, for example, a US federal court ruled against Texaco which had argued
that in photocopying scientific papers, it was protected from copyright
infringement allegations since the papers were used for research.
With fair use vaguely defined by US courts, many multimedia applications
developers are looking for copyright-free material. The largest source of
copyright-free text is Project Gutenberg. It offers 50 copyright-free
publications in digital form, known as 'etexts'. These include classic books
such as Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. Michael Hart, founder of Project
Gutenberg, says it will offer 10,000 etexts by the end of the decade.
Multimedia title developers can also turn to a growing number of CD-Rom
disks full of music clips, photographs and video footage, all available
without copyright fees.
None the less, copyright-free or public domain material is a limited
resource. A copyright clearance mechanism is needed that allows copyright
holders to tap into the potentially lucrative multimedia applications market
without surrendering control over their work. Multimedia title producers, in
turn, need an easy way to reach copyright holders and negotiate copyright
clearance fees.
One solution could be the creation of copyright clearance centres that would
represent the works of artists, musicians, photographers, video producers
and authors. Such centres would allow multimedia developers to shop for
content and pay a reasonable fee for the material used. The benefits of such
a system would be to remove roadblocks to a new industry that could provide
consumers with a wide range of multimedia titles.
