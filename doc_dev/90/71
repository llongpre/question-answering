<LEADPARA>  Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's popular yet divisive plan to cut Social
Security taxes could put the retirement system at risk of bankruptcy,
President Bush warned the Senate on Tuesday.;    In a letter to Senate leaders
as they prepared for a test vote likely to come today, Bush said the payroll
tax rollback "would return Social Security to the same financing scheme that
drove the system to the brink of insolvency in 1982."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On the Senate floor, Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the current practice of
borrowing the Social Security surplus to cover other government expenses is
risky.;    $1 billion a week;  "This very week, we will spend more than $1
billion in the trust funds for the general purposes of government, everything
from battleships to paper clips," Moynihan said. "If this were done by a
private company or a union pension fund, the penalties would be swift.";   
The Senate is scheduled to vote today on the preliminary yet crucial step of
making room for Moynihan's plan in the budget. That would clear the way for
him to offer the actual tax-cut legislation later.;    Moynihan, who maintains
that his plan would in no way endanger Social Security, has accused Bush of
misrepresenting the issue and "terrorizing older people" in a "slash-and-burn"
campaign to defeat the tax cut.;    Bush's warning;  Bush said in his letter
that if the economy were to go into a long downturn, "adoption of this
legislation could again threaten to bankrupt the Social Security system.";   
Arguing that the Social Security trust fund surplus is still being misused to
cover the federal deficit, Moynihan contended that the system should revert to
pay-as-you-go financing, with an 18-month contingency reserve.;    Under his
plan, the 6.2 percent payroll tax paid by employees and employers would be cut
to 5.7 percent in July, 5.5 percent in 1994 and 5.2 percent in 1996. The bill
would raise the lid on the wages taxed from the current $53,400 to $82,000 by
1996.;    The tax cut, which would reverse the policy of saving for the
retirement of the baby boom generation, is estimated to cost the Social
Security system $160 billion to $170 billion over five years. Moynihan's staff
projected that taxes would have to be raised again around 2010.  </TEXT>
