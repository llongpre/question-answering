   Oliver North's jury debated his guilt or
innocence in a tightly guarded room Friday, as an alternate juror
who heard all the testimony said she would have voted to convict
him on some of the 12 charges.
   The jurors deliberated for about six hours before quitting for
the day. They will resume Saturday morning.
   ``Mr. North ... wasn't made to do what he did,'' said Horasina
McKie, one of five alternates dismissed when the case went to the
jury. ``He had a choice in it. He had a choice to either say `No, I
don't want to do this' or `Yes sir, I will do this' even as it went
along and he knew it was wrong.''
   North is charged with withholding information from Congress,
lying to Attorney General Edwin Meese III about his activities in
the Iran-Contra affair, destroying and altering documents, misusing
money entrusted to him and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a
$13,800 security system at his home.
   Ms. McKie said she had not discussed the case with other jurors
_ following the strict instructions given daily by U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell _ and did not know how they feel.
   If that held true for the entire jury, the nine women and three
men judging North discussed the former National Security Council
aide for the first time starting at 9:40 a.m.
   They could not help but notice on their arrival _ and on their
departure _ that the courthouse, between the Capitol and the White
House, had become a news media center. Huge television trucks were
parked on the street, wires snaked around the building and cameras
were aimed at every entrance.
   The jurors quickly had requests, relayed to the judge on notes.
They asked for copies of Gesell's instructions, which took more
than two hours to read in court; for note pads, paper clips and
pencils.
   Jury members will deliberate a half day on Saturday, but not on
Sunday. Their lunches in the courthouse are being catered.
   After a night sequestered in a downtown hotel, the jurors were
brought to the federal courthouse in a van and taken to an 18-by-12
room only a few feet away from the courtroom where they had
listened to testimony for eight weeks. Their room was further
crowded with hundreds of exhibits, some still classified as top
secret. A U.S. marshal guarded the door..
   The foreman is a 34-year-old hospital clerk, Denise Anderson,
who said during pre-trial questioning that she does not like news
and that the extensive television coverage given North's testimony
during the 1987 congressional hearings ``made me mad. ... I did not
look at it at all.''
   Ms. McKie, the alternate juror who commented in an interview
with CBS News, touched on one of North's major defenses, that he
was authorized to do all he did.
   ``No one said, `If you don't do this we're going to fire you,'''
the alternate juror said. In his instructions, Gesell had told the
jury to remember that no one, including the president, had the
right to order an unlawful act.
   ``I believe Mr. Reagan knew what was going on,'' Ms. McKie said.
``I can't say he knew everything, but I think he knew enough to
know what was going on. I mean, you see (National Security Adviser
Robert) McFarlane every week, he's only 100 yards from you or feet
from you.''
   Reagan told the investigative Tower commission two years ago
that he did not know the National Security Council staff was
engaged in helping the Contra rebels in Nicaragua when official
U.S. aid was banned.
   North testified he was acting under orders, even when he lied to
a congressional committee in denying he was assisting the Contras.
He said that he had no idea any of his actions violated the law and
that he had good motives for what he did.
   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 60 years in
prison and fined as much as $3 million. However, federal court
practice is generally to limit sentences to the longest term for
any one count _ in this case 10 years.
