<TEXT>  A  Nope. It sounds like someone gave you misinformation. A state Lottery
spokeswoman says that if a person wins the jackpot, the prize is paid over a
20-year period. If that winner should die, the remainder of the prize is paid
to the heir or estate of the winner.; KEEPING OLD NEWS ALIVE;  Q  How can I
preserve a copy of the Oct. 17 newspaper?;    -- A.M., San Jose; A  Living
through the Loma Prieta earthquake might have been a lot easier than trying to
preserve the entire earthquake anniversary edition of the San Jose Mercury
News. Newspapers are known to museum experts as an "inherent vice" because of
their high acid content and unstable ink, says San Jose Historical Museum
archivist Leslie Masunaga. If you merely want to keep an article for framing
or for its contents, she suggests you forget about the original and instead
photocopy the article onto a good quality, low-acid paper. But if you're
hoping to keep the front page or the entire newspaper for its historical
value, you'll need to keep it flat and away from light, insects and moisture.
It's best to store the paper in between two boards and put sheets of tissue
between the pages to keep the ink from blurring. Store the paper under a bed
or in a closet, rather than in an attic or garage, where moisture and changing
temperatures can destroy it. Don't laminate the paper, and try not to take it
out too often. If you must exhibit a section of a newspaper, do so away from
direct light. "The newspapers you hear of lasting the longest have never seen
the light of day," Masunaga says. The most popular method of preserving a
clipping is dipping it in a solution made from dissolving milk of magnesia, by
tablet or liquid, into a quart of club soda. Store it in a closed container in
the refrigerator overnight before using. Wrap wet clippings in plastic wrap or
aluminum foil and allow to sit for one hour before air drying. Chemical washes
for the same purpose and special boxes for storing papers are available at art
supply and conservator stores. The names of such stores are available by
calling the Historical Museum at (408) 287-2290.; SUBSCRIPTION ISSUE; Q  I
received the following unsolicited offer or invoice from Discover magazine. To
prevent Discover from entering a subscription in my name, I have to return the
invoice with the words "no thanks" on it at my expense. Because I did not
initiate the communication, I feel that it is inappropriate for Discover to
require a response from me. I have had the same problem with other companies.
How can I prevent such mailings? Is this type of mailing even legal?;    --
Roxanne Worlock, San Jose; A  It's legal. It's not an unsolicited offer, says
Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Discover. It's sent only in response to a
subscription application. That means either someone in your household returned
a subscription card or it was a prank. Discover doesn't send any unsolicited
invoices, Jay says.  </TEXT>
