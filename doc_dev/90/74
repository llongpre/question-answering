   The jury in the Oliver North Iran-Contra trial
deliberated for its longest day Tuesday but failed again to reach
agreement on the guilt or innocence of the former National Security
Council aide.
   There has been no word from the jurors about progress in the
nearly two weeks since U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
admonished them that ``in order to return a verdict on any aspect
of this case it is necessary that each juror agree to the verdict.''
   The jury, which is sequestered in a downtown hotel while not
meeting, worked nearly 7{ hours on its 10th day of deliberations,
for a total 53 hours.
   No one outside the jury room knows what is going on inside but
the requirement of unanimity for reaching a verdict ``on any
aspect'' seems a likely difficulty.
   ``Your verdict must be unanimous,'' Gesell said on April 20 when
he sent the jury from the courtroom with orders to begin weighing
the case the next day, a Friday.
   The jurors were told to communicate with the judge only through
notes and were told: ``You are never to reveal to any person, not
even the court, how the jury vote stands numerically or otherwise
on the question of guilt or innocence'' until the verdict is in.
   In the first three days there were eight notes. They dealt
mostly with office supplies _ the jurors wanted legal pads, paper
clips and sharpened pencils _ but not with any substance that would
give a clue to possible problems in agreeing on a verdict.
   Juries, especially those that are arguing about a particular
point, often ask to have a particular piece of testimony re-read to
them, an activity that takes place in open court with lawyers and
defendant present. In those cases, spectators have an inkling about
why the jury finds it difficult to reach a verdict.
   The last note from the North jury was sent to the judge a week
ago Monday. Since then there has been no communication from the
courtroom where the jury sits surrounded by 1,300 pages of
documents _ the 363 exhibits introduced in the trial.
   The sheer volume of those exhibits, the two months of testimony,
and the 12 felony charges in the case made it certain that a
conscientious jury would take time.
   But courthouse observers, many of whom had predicted a verdict
would be reached last week, now are discussing the possibility that
the jurors may be unable to agree on one or more counts.
   If the jury reported itself deadlocked on all counts, Gesell
most likely would send them back to try again _ until they reported
there was no hope of agreement. If they still could not get a
unanimous vote on one or more counts, prosecutors would have to
decide later whether to bring the charges again.
   Ten days is not a record; it is not even close. In the federal
court in the District of Columbia, a trial of Black Hebrews in 1986
on racketeering charges set a modern deliberation record of 200
hours over 36 days.
   Meanwhile, a lawyer for 10 news organizations seeking access to
a document that the jury was allowed to see filed a memorandum with
Gesell saying that ``the fact that the document at issue here has
been designated classified'' is no reason to withhold it from the
public.
   Gesell had questioned the right of the news organizations to
intervene in the case. Attorney Timothy B. Dyk told Gesell that the
Supreme Court and courts of appeal have recognized that the press
may ``assert the rights of public access to proceedings and records
in criminal cases.''
   The document in question is a summary of hundreds of
intelligence ``intercepts'' through which the National Security
Agency tracked a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
   The news organizations involved in the case are The Associated
Press; Cable News Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.;
Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National
Public Radio; The New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co., and The
Washington Post.
