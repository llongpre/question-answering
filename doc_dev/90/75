   John Demjanjuk, who has spent the past 11 years
fighting charges he was the notorious Nazi death camp guard ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court
battle in Israel.
   The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than
15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust
survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself.
   Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, the only other Nazi war
criminal to be tried in Israel, was convicted and hanged in 1962.
Unlike Eichmann, Demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of
mistaken identity.
   The retired autoworker from Cleveland, Ohio, is charged with
being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that
killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland in 1942 and 1943. ``Ivan'' allegedly tortured prisoners on
their way to their deaths.
   Many observers argue the case against Demjanjuk has not been
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, despite the tearful insistence
of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant
as ``Ivan'' more than 40 years after the Holocaust.
   But few Israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict.
For them, the only question is whether the Ukrainian-born
Demjanjuk, 68, will be spared the death penalty.
   ``After the emotional accounts of the survivors, people expect a
guilty verdict,'' said Gabriel Bron, a reporter for the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper who covered the trial.
   ``Many want vengeance and a death sentence, but there is a
minority voice calling for life imprisonment.''
   If Demjanjuk is found guilty Monday, he will be sentenced at a
later, separate hearing.
   About 250,000 spectators attended the trial's 106 sessions,
which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of
$650,000.
   Despite holes in the prosecution case, Demjanjuk was plagued
throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to
move two steps backward for every step forward.
   Demjanjuk's relatives raised more than $650,000 for the defense,
but their lawyers often appeared unprepared, failed to come up with
a coherent account of his whereabouts during World War II and
antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd.
   Two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of
cross-examination, one claiming the defense had threatened a law
suit if he continued to testify.
   Other defense experts were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were questioned.
   Even Demjanjuk grew frustrated, firing Mark O'Connor of Buffalo,
N.Y., his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings.
   But Demjanjuk's supporters contend the defendant's biggest
problem was being tried before Jewish judges of the same generation
as the Nazi victims testifying against him.
   One judge, Polish-born Zvi Tal, lost family in the Holocaust.
   Much of the trial focused on a lengthy, often repetitive debate
over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence,
Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card.
   About 500 exhibits, including a paper clip, were submitted to
bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card
was authentic. Six defense witnesses maintained the document was
fake.
   Demjanjuk contends the document was fabricated by the Soviet
Union to punish him for serving in an anti-Communist unit formed by
the Nazis at the end of World War II.
   Although interest waned and frustration mounted in Israel as
Demjanjuk's trial dragged on for months, some Israelis say the fact
that it took place at all has healed some wounds.
   ``The trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many Holocaust
victims,'' said Cleveland-born Toby Greenwald, whose father-in-law,
Menachem, lost his entire family in Nazi death camps.
   He always refused to talk about his experiences but ``there was
something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep
well,'' she said. ``He began to release all those pent-up
feelings.''
   But the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to
dozens of Nazi victims who attended the trial over the year.
   ``If the judges don't find him guilty, I think I'll kill
myself,'' said Holocaust survivor Mordechai Fuchs, 63, as he
tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents, three brothers
and a sister killed at Treblinka.
   Even if Demjanjuk wins an acquittal Monday, he will not walk
away from the converted movie theater in Jerusalem a free man.
   Stripped of his U.S. citizenship before extradition to Israel in
February 1986, Demjanjuk is stateless.
   Lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the United
States to consider reactivating plans to deport Demjanjuk to the
Soviet Union. Such a move had been a possibility before 1983, when
Israel requested his extradition.
   ``This is a man without a nation, he has no papers. When the
trial ends, our problems don't end. They're only beginning,'' said
Demjanjuk's son-in-law Ed Nishnic.
