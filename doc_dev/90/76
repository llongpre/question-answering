   One of the jurors deliberating Iran-Contra
charges against Oliver North has high blood pressure and will be
examined by a doctor, the trial judge said today.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell identified the juror as
Jean Johnson and said she has been experiencing high blood pressure
during the jury deliberations, which began Friday.
   Mrs. Johnson is a 53-year-old cashier whose husband is disabled.
   ``I would like to arrange'' for a doctor to ``take a look at
her,'' Gesell said in court. She will be examined in the presence
of a deputy U.S. marshal.
   Meanwhile, Gesell said NBC News left unsigned letters at the
homes of jurors in the North case, inviting them to do interviews
after the trial is over. He said the letters had been picked up by
deputies from the U.S. Marshals Service.
   ``I think it's most inappropriate,'' said Gesell, ``quite
disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with.''
   Peggy Hubble, NBC network news spokeswoman in New York, said,
``The jurors are sequestered, so they're not at their homes. ...It
was intended for them to see them when they got home after they
made their decision after the trial, and the letter specifically
requested an interview after the trial.''
   She said the network was ``sorry if there was any inconvenience
or misinterpretation.''
   Meanwhile today, President Bush told reporters on a
cross-country trip that it was ``stupid'' and ``idiotic'' to
speculate about whether he would pardon North should the former
White House aide be convicted.
   Told that Newsweek magazine was quoting sources close to him as
predicting he would never pardon North, the president said:
``That's interesting speculation. It shows how stupid some reports
are. That matter has never been discussed with me by anyone,
including my wife.''
   He said ``it shows you how idiotic speculation is.''
   The jury resumed resumed deliberations today after a one-day
leisure break and quickly complained that ``we did not receive
paper clips'' they had requested Saturday.
   The note, sent to the judge, was the fourth to date. All
concerned office supplies: sharpened pencils, highlighters, note
pads.
   The nine women and three men were brought from their downtown
hotel in a van for their third day of meetings shortly before 9 a.m.
   The marshals taped television shows for them over the weekend
and cut out anything that might refer to the North trial or the
Iran-Contra affair. And the guards remained nearby while the jurors
spent a leisurely Sunday with their families to ensure that there
be no discussion about the case.
   Meanwhile today, an alternate juror, dismissed Thursday when the
case went to the jury, said on ``CBS This Morning'' that ``I just
felt for'' North.
   ``I had a sense that ... higher-ups was involved,'' Linda Brown
Clark said. Asked whether President Bush or former President Reagan
should have been asked to testify, she said:
   ``I think it might have helped, you know, to find out if they
was actually behind it ... or if they was telling him what to do
... if it was his job, you know. It would have been easier for him
and it might not even have come to trial if someone would have
spoke up.''
   North subpoenaed both Bush and Reagan. U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell set aside the Bush subpoena and quashed the one
for Reagan.
   North is charged with lying to Congress, illegally converting
$4,300 travelers' checks to hiw own use conspiring to commit tax
fraud in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The jurors spent about three hours in the jury room Saturday
before taking off the rest of the weekend. They are being housed in
a downtown hotel and are accompanied by marshals to make sure there
are no outside influences about the trial.
   The jurors are forbidden to talk about the case, even among
themselves, when they are not in deliberations. Their families were
allowed to visit them during Sunday's day off.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts that include lying to
Congress, obstructing congressional and presidential inquiries, and
making personal use of Iran-Contra funds.
   Most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and
$250,000 fines upon conviction, with the total possible punishment
being 60 years and fines of $3 million.
