The dead man did it. 
</P>
<P>
So concluded defense attorney Richard (Racehorse) Haynes during closing 
arguments Thursday in the seven-week trial of Janet Faye McKinzie, who is 
accused of looting North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana with the help 
of the thrift's president, Duayne D. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes told jurors in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana that Christensen -- a 
former dentist who died in a mysterious car crash just 9 1/2 hours before 
regulators seized the institution -- was the mastermind of a plot to steal tens 
of millions of dollars from North America. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen and McKinzie lived lavishly, spending freely on everything from 
extravagant parties with Sammy Davis Jr. as entertainment to trinkets such as a 
$500 gold paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Seave portrayed the couple in his closing arguments 
as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, working together to carry out complicated 
schemes to defraud the thrift. The jury is expected to begin deliberations 
today. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 26 counts of 
racketeering, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. If convicted, she faces a sentence of more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Haynes characterized McKinzie as "a washed-out zombie" simply taking orders 
from Christensen, who was allegedly plying her with massive doses of 
prescription drugs, including anti-anxiety medications such as Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, one of the nation's leading defense attorneys, called Christensen the 
Jim Jones of the savings and loan industry, a reference to the cult religious 
figure who led more than 900 followers in a mass suicide in Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen "was able to make people believe things that weren't true," Haynes 
contended. "He could make them put the cyanide in the Kool-Aid. That was Dr. 
Christensen." 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Seave balked at the notion that North America's 1987 collapse 
was only Christensen's doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is Dr. Christensen was a crook," Seave said, "and the 
defendant was his right-hand man." 
</P>
<P>
He told jurors that McKinzie was completely aware of what she was doing, taking 
the lead in two schemes to defraud North America of more than $16 million. He 
produced document after document that the prosecution has said were falsified 
at McKinzie's instruction to cover up the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"For her counsel to suggest she was insane at the time," Seave said, "is 
preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors showed jurors a memo allegedly from McKinzie that 
supposedly ordered the forging of some bank documents. 
</P>
<P>
"Put in sealed envelopes so it looks professional and I'll open. Be sure to 
sign good," McKinzie allegedly wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this sound like someone who has a bad memory, is confused, intoxicated, 
acting like a robot?" Seave asked jurors. "Dr. Christensen was not there, 
behind her, moving her arms, moving her lips. . . . The evidence is 
overwhelming (that) the defendant knew exactly what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes appealed to the jury to acquit McKinzie. "Take the manipulative hands 
(of Christensen) off the body and soul of this woman and let her go home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The North America trial represents the government's first use of RICO (the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) against a failed S&amp;L on 
the West Coast. RICO was used so that the government could freeze the proceeds 
from a $10-million life insurance policy that Christensen had bought for 
McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
North America was shut down in 1988, costing taxpayers $120 million.
