<P>
Doctor, doctor, come quick! They've brought in another one!" 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell me." 
</P>
<P>
"Another Clipper." 
</P>
<P>
"I told you not to tell me." 
</P>
<P>
"He's hurt, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course he's hurt, nurse. He's a Clipper." 
</P>
<P>
"Leg injury, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"Wow, there's a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
"His name is Gary Grant." 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed all his movies." 
</P>
<P>
"No. Gary." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh." 
</P>
<P>
"Where should I put him?" 
</P>
<P>
"Over there, by the others." 
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of room in there, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"I know. It looks like a ski lodge. We're turning into Clippers Sinai." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Harper's appointment is at 3." 
</P>
<P>
"And Mr. Manning?" 
</P>
<P>
"His checkup is at 4." 
</P>
<P>
"What about those other basketball people, the ones with the hamstrings?" 
</P>
<P>
"Those were Lakers, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"Strange how all these L.A. players hurt their legs, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you suppose causes it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Maybe they don't pump enough air into their tennis shoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm." 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe they don't do enough walking. These Los Angeles people drive 
everywhere, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"You may have something there." 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers shouldn't have shoe contracts. They should have cane contracts." 
</P>
<P>
"True." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, these guys really take it on the shins." 
</P>
<P>
"How are the Clippers doing, by the way?" 
</P>
<P>
"They're showing a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they'll probably break that before the season's over." 
</P>
<P>
"They've invented a new lineup -- the No-Guard offense." 
</P>
<P>
"Who brings the ball up?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody. After every opponent's basket, the Clipper coach calls a timeout. That 
way they get the ball at mid-court." 
</P>
<P>
"Very clever." 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers are thinking about starting five 7-footers. The Quintuple 
Towers." 
</P>
<P>
"Might just work." 
</P>
<P>
"Or, sometimes they use David Rivers." 
</P>
<P>
"David Rivers? Didn't he used to play for the Lakers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not so you'd know it." 
</P>
<P>
"How about trading for a guard?" 
</P>
<P>
"Funny you should mention that. Elgin Baylor just called me. He's about to 
trade for a guy, but first he wants us to do something for him." 
</P>
<P>
"Namely?" 
</P>
<P>
"He wants us to X-ray the guy's legs." 
</P>
<P>
"I see." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to make the guy run 82 simulated NBA games on a treadmill." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame him." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to do an arthroscopic exam, a total leg massage, a blood 
transfusion, a cartilage transplant, an athlete's foot inspection, and then 
soak the guy's legs for four hours in boiling Perrier with lime." 
</P>
<P>
"OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to telephone every living relative of the guy and ask them if 
they have any history of leg problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Will do." 
</P>
<P>
"Then he wants us to strike the guy's knee with a hammer, every 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"To check his reflexes?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. To check the hammer." 
</P>
<P>
"Anything else?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. He wants to know if there's anything we can do to guarantee a minor leg 
injury, and not another one that's going to take a year to heal." 
</P>
<P>
"No. Tell Mr. Baylor I'm sorry, but all I can do is make a suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
"What?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to trade every healthy body he has, before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
"You think so?" 
</P>
<P>
"How about that Charles Smith person? Are his legs OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"Far as I know." 
</P>
<P>
"Then get Elgin on the phone and tell him to trade that man, immediately!" 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. The man is afflicted with Clipper Syndrome. It's only a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"What should he trade Smith for?" 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody. Anything. Trade him for Ralph Sampson. His legs already are shot. 
It'll save the Clippers a lot of time and trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"What about Danny Ainge or Jeff Malone?" 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not! I have examined the legs of Mr. Ainge and Mr. Malone, and they 
are perfect! Don't you dare trade them to the Clippers! These men have families 
to think about." 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably insured." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding? No insurance company in America will write a policy on a 
Clipper today. They've already paid off a fortune to these people. It's called 
dribble indemnity." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what you mean. Marques Johnson, Norm Nixon, Derek Smith, Manning, 
Harper, Grant . . . the Clippers could have won three world championships by 
now, if they played wheelchair basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be cruel." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should just put them out of their misery." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"They shoot Clippers, don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well. Maybe the All-Star break will help them heal up." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say 'break' around the Clippers. Besides, there's only one thing that 
could help that team." 
</P>
<P>
"What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
"If the All-Star break lasted two years."
