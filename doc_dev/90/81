tells Richard Waters about his serious money and what he does with it

Alan Greenberg - 'Ace' to his friends - looks exasperated. 'I'm just so sick
of hearing about this money thing. I'm so sick of having us compared with
other people.'
The 'money thing' Greenberg is so sick of hearing about is his own,
sizeable, income. Last year it was Dollars 15.8m. This year it is Dollars
15.9m. What's the lowest it has been in the past ten years or so? 'I don't
know, maybe Dollars 4m or Dollars 5m. I don't remember.' Even by the
standards of the well-paid ranks of senior US executives, this counts as
serious money.
But then, as Greenberg says, he is different. He trades shares. Not only
that: he sits at the focal point of one of New York's busiest trading
floors. And this has been a blockbuster year, even by Wall Street standards.
So why should anyone begrudge him his Dollars 15.9m?
Before tackling that thorny subject, it's important to realise that
Greenberg isn't just any share-trader. He's been doing it for decades
('forty four years and nine months,' he points out helpfully) and is said to
be very good at it. Although chairman of Bear Stearns, a securities house
that employs 6,500 people, he spends most of his time at his desk on the
equity trading floor, directing the hubbub.
Greenberg's image as a gruff, wise-cracking trader has hardened around him
like a crust. When delivering interviews from his perch on the equity
trading floor at the Bear Stearns offices on Park Avenue, he slips easily
into the mould that he has created for himself in a succession of interviews
over the years.
He spits out homilies and dispenses no-nonsense views on life and the
markets as if by rote. He favours being photographed with a fat cigar in his
hand. It is disconcerting when quotations from previous interviews, ones
that obviously pleased him, reappear on his lips.
Journalists, you can tell, like this version of Greenberg. His history has
been told and re-told through the years in a rag-bag of anecdotes. The memo
he once wrote telling staff to re-use paper clips, rather than buy new ones.
How, as share prices crashed in 1987, he practised his golf swing on the
trading floor and said he might take the next day off to play a round. His
fondness for playing bridge and impressing interviewers with card tricks (he
is a member of the Society of American Magicians).
Greenberg plays along gamely. Keen to demonstrate his contempt for
high-flown management theorising, he rummages through a pile of paper on his
desk to find 'some of the nonsense people say'. He quotes from various
papers: ''Re-engineering business' . . . 'economic value added' . . . that's
some of the nonsense I have to listen to.' He has done this in other
interviews as well, and it obviously works.
Although much of this is for show, Greenberg really does appear to have a
straightforward approach to running a trading firm. Every Monday, Bears
Stearns' traders attend a meeting where their trading positions are
discussed. A team of spies patrols the floors constantly, trying to make
sure no one is covering up a big loss.
Aren't more sophisticated methods available for managing trading risks these
days? No, says Greenberg. 'People can read things, write things that aren't
exactly true.'
He explains: 'Traders are reluctant to put down accurate prices. That's a
constant problem we and everyone else has. They don't want to show a loss,
and that's a bad mistake. If they do it, they're out - O-U-T' (That also
echoes from a previous interview.)
Not letting small trading losses turn into big ones is one of the very few
trading philosophies that Greenberg admits to. All loss-making positions are
closed, he says. 'We don't carry big losses. We just sell 'em.'
Ask Greenberg what is the biggest loss he has ever been responsible for, and
an interesting thing happens. The gruff front falters for a minute and he
chuckles boyishly. He looks younger than his 66 years anyway, but this makes
him look younger still. Many years before, when Bear Stearns' capital was
only Dollars 30m or so, he managed 'a loss of Dollars 1m, which at that time
was really big'.
So what about the 'money thing' that gets Greenberg so riled? He isn't the
highest-paid Wall Street trader; that bouquet goes to George Soros, Michael
Steinhardt and the rest of the band of so-called 'hedge fund' managers. But
among the heads of Wall Street firms, his earnings were exceeded last year
only by Stephen Friedman and Robert Rubin, then co-heads of Goldman Sachs.
The attention this attracts clearly annoys him. Of nameless critics, he
says: 'They don't know how much money I make for this firm, so how can they
say it's big or little? How can anyone say what I should rate without
knowing what I do?'
Also, Greenberg's basic salary is Dollars 200,000 - the rest comes from
bonuses when the firm is making a profit. 'I don't know of one other
corporation where the top people want to run the risks with their income
that we do. When many companies lose money, the bosses get a raise.'
Well, yes. But judging by Bear Stearns' performance in recent years, the
danger of not making a profit is not that great.
And now the really important questions: how does he spend all that money?
The pleasing boyish chuckle comes back. Greenberg claims not to have any
expensive habits. He recomposes his face, prepares to tell about the
philanthropy that is widely commented on. 'My wife and I give a lot of money
away every year. How much is a personal matter.'
And then there is betting. Small amounts on football (he is a fan of the New
York Giants), much more on cards. 'I like to gamble big at bridge. I like to
gamble. Every businessman is a gambler.'
He slides off into another homily, this time about the importance of
risk-taking in business. But you can tell that only half his mind is on it.
He's impatient to get this interview over and get back to the serious
business of making money.
