   A savings and loan executive convicted
of looting a failed thrift of more than $15 million and using the
money to support a Rolls-Royce lifestyle was sentenced Friday to 20
years in prison.
   Janet Faye McKinzie, 41, of Newport Beach also was ordered by
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie Stotler to make restitution of
nearly $14 million taken from North America Savings &amp; Loan of Santa
Ana.
   ``It was a very, very appropriate sentence,'' said U.S. Attorney
Paul Seave. ``Fair in a sense that it works as a deterrent in other
S&amp;L crimes and white-collar crime in general.''
   Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes, McKinzie's attorney, pleaded for
leniency.
   ``You want to see a grown man cry?'' he told the judge. ``Janet
McKinzie is paying the price for the S&amp;L bailout.''
   Haynes had portrayed his client as a ``washed-out zombie,''
hooked on prescription drugs given her by North America's chairman,
dentist Duayne Christensen, and duped into following Christensen's
orders.
   McKinzie had been the business manager for Christensen, who died
in a car crash just hours after federal regulators took over the
thrift in January 1987, declaring it insolvent.
   Christensen was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in
McKinzie's case.
   McKinzie, the first person to be convicted under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in connection with a West
Coast savings and loan failure, appeared composed as her sentence
was read.
   She wept in March when she was convicted of 22 counts of
racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property. She had faced a maximum 175-year
prison term, but prosecutors asked for the term given.
   McKinzie, who held the title of consultant at North America, was
denied bail pending an appeal. She will be eligible for parole in
about seven years, Seave said.
   The North America case was considered among the top in the
widespread S&amp;L crisis ``in terms of how egregious the fraud was,''
William Davis, chief deputy of the California Department of Savings
and Loan, has said.
   The S&amp;L's collapse eventually cost taxpayers more than $120
million.
   Federal prosecutors had painted McKinzie and Christensen as a
modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, stealing millions from North America
to support their extravagant tastes.
   Each had a Rolls-Royce automobile, and they treated themselves
to such baubles as a $125,000 gold eagle statue, an $18,500 letter
opener and a $500 gold paper clip.
   McKinzie's 37th birthday was celebrated with a party at the
Newport Beach Marriott, where hundreds of guests were entertained
by Sammy Davis Jr. singing songs including ``Happy Birthday.''
   Following criminal investigations into North America's
operation, McKinzie was sued in February 1987 for acting with
Christensen to defraud the institution and causing its collapse.
   In March 1987, federal regulators operating the thrift estimated
the amount missing at $40 million. In June 1988, it was announced
North America would be closed and liquidated.
   Federal prosecutors employed the RICO statute so the government
could try to claim the proceeds from Christensen's $10 million life
insurance policy, which named McKinzie as sole beneficiary.
   Three of McKinzie's associates have pleaded guilty to criminal
charges in connection with alleged fraud at North America.
