<LEADPARA>  Small children are drawn to computers by the special instinct they all have
for expensive things that are easy to break. But there's a book and computer
disk combo that might boost the computer's survival chances and teach the
little ones something, too.;   "My First Computer Book" (Workman Publishing,
$17.95) by David Schiller and David Rosenbloom features Bialosky Bear, a teddy
bear whose mission in life is to guide children ages 4 through 7 through
computing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 65-page book with illustrations by Tedd Arnold comes with a floppy disk
and is available for either IBM PCs with a color monitor or Apple II-series
machines.;   The software, which only takes about 182,000 characters of
storage space in the IBM version, is nicely designed and seems to be aimed at
the lower end of the 4-7 age bracket. It can work with keyboard or mouse and
is divided into five activities.;   The music section features six children's
tunes. Another feature turns the PC keyboard into a sort of toy piano,
allowing a toddler to drive grown-ups bonkers with a series of speaker beeps
in a one-octave range.;   The art section features pre-drawn pictures and pots
of "paint." The idea is to select the color and then put the cursor where the
color should go. The computer fills in that part of the sketch with the
selected color.;   A story section has simple build-as-you-go stories, but
some reading is required. The other two sections involve getting the bear
dressed for playing in the snow and a sort of random bouncing shape game that
might even be therapeutic for adults.;   The book is aimed toward the upper
end of the 4-7 age bracket. It is a first-rate explanation of what a computer
is, how it works and what useful things it does.;   In very simple terms, for
example, the book covers bits and bytes and then comes up with an activity.
The bits and bytes activity is to flash the child's name with a flashlight,
using the alphabet printed in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange).;   The book gets across the idea of a computer "language" such
as BASIC or PASCAL by offering situations such as being asked to rake the
lawn.;   "Please go into the garage, find the rake, bring the rake outside,
start in one corner of the yard, begin moving the rake to . . . " is said to
be the non-language way.;   "Could you please rake the lawn today?" is said to
be the language way and is described as "a shortcut.";   Any computer language
is nothing more than a shortcut to allow humans to deal with the machine at
something better than the mind-numbing step-by-step level of electrical
switches on and off, but that's a fairly nifty way of delivering the concept
to a young mind -- and maybe even some older ones.;   The book includes some
common-sense do's and don'ts about living with a computer. They should help
the older children understand why Mommy and Daddy got red in the face when the
disk drive was stuffed full of paper clips.;   All told, it's worth the money
if your kid is curious about computers and not yet up to more demanding
games.;   The ISBN number is 0-89480-835-4. Write to Workman Publishing, 708
