<LEADPARA>  YOU'VE probably read in this newspaper or heard on radio or television that
Caltrans is conducting a massive road repair project on Highway 17, between
Los Gatos and the outskirts of Santa Cruz. Each article, each broadcast has
warned motorists of delays.;   For some reason the warnings bypassed that
portion of my brain that receives and stores such stuff, and midday last
Wednesday I headed for Santa Cruz, allowing one hour to make the trip from
downtown Mountain View to downtown Santa Cruz.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "You should have taken Old Santa Cruz Highway to Soquel and then back to
Santa Cruz," Jim Heitzig, a daily commuter to San Jose from Aptos, told me.
"You would have bypassed all the road construction.";   Well, I didn't bypass
the road work. Instead, I was one of the bumper-to-bumper drivers
rubbernecking, I mean surveying, the paving while rolling at a speed so slow
that it didn't register on the speedometer.;   You will probably find that the
biggest traffic deterrent is the truck in front, or possibly the truck behind,
or one of the other 140,000 trucks heading in the same direction as you. They
seem to move at a reasonable speed once they get going, but getting started
from a dead stop is a lesson in driving patience.;   WHEN traffic came to a
standstill at what's known as Big Moody Curve (I think so named because you
get a pretty big mood adjustment when it takes 20 minutes or so to creep
around it), I filled the time with a little interior car maintenance.;   In
fact, if you are making the journey to Santa Cruz while the roadwork is in
progress, here are some tips to make the delays productive:;   (check) If your
car or truck has a center console, use the down time to gather accumulated
lint and other collectibles from these junk drawers on wheels. I found two
single earrings, one-half piece of un-chewed chewing gum, a deceased ballpoint
pen, miscellaneous fast- food receipts, paper clips, rubber bands, a
fluorescent golf ball and 31 cents.;   (check) Time permitting -- and you can
almost be assured that until the repaving project is completed time will
permit -- reach across the dash to the glove box and sort through its
contents. I found gas receipts from a period in American history when gas cost
less than $1 a gallon, a burned-out light bulb from a taillamp, about
two-thirds of a street map of San Jose, the match to one of the earrings I
found in the center console and a leaking bottle of hand lotion.;   (check)
Probably the best thing you could do for yourself is to spend the time
enjoying the natural beauty of the Santa Cruz Mountains. If you're like me, we
tend to speed along and miss much of what lies between the valley and the
coast.;   IT TOOK almost twice as long to get there as I'd planned, but I
don't want to discourage you from going "over the hill." Regardless of how
long it takes to get there, the reward is the sea air and the charm of this
coastal community that even the earthquake couldn't destroy.;   The return
trip? Well, that's another story. You might want to leave some interior
cleaning to do. On the way home I found out that other drivers really get
pushed out of shape when you get out of the car and start straightening the
trunk.  </TEXT>
