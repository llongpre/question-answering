   The judge in Oliver North's trial said today
he imposed a longer daily work schedule on the jury and said he
isn't surprised the panel is in its 11th day of deliberations
without reaching a verdict.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said in a court session that
he initiated the move to have the jury start promptly at 9 in the
morning, take a half hour for lunch and stay until 5 in the
afternoon. That schedule began Tuesday.
   Gesell said that due to health problems among some jurors early
in the deliberations, the panel had been working more limited hours
and ``they had gotten used to a shorter'' schedule. One panel
member was experiencing high blood pressure and a few others had
colds, but all are now in good health.
   The judge made the remarks in response to letters from
prosecutors and North's lawyers inquiring about various aspects of
deliberations.
   ``I felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they
came in in the morning they were not starting as early as they
could have when they arrived,'' said Gesell. As for leaving at 4:15
in the afternoon, ``I felt I should indicate they should stay.''
   Gesell said he doesn't think it is surprising that the
deliberations are growing lengthy, in view of the fact that there
have been ``67 witnesses, 41 trial days and we are dealing with
over 250 exhibits.''
   ``We are running out of books'' to while away the hours,
prosecutor John Keker quipped, referring to the length of
deliberations.
   Gesell responded by saying he understood there is ``a movie you
could look at,'' referring to the TV miniseries on North's life,
``Guts and Glory,'' which concluded Tuesday night.
   The panel of nine women and three men deliberated 7{ hours
Tuesday, bringing the total spent at the end of the day since April
21 to 53.
   The jurors have put in six-hour workdays on three occasions
since that time, but hadn't gone longer than that until Tuesday.
   There has been no word from the jury since April 24, when the
last of eight notes was sent to Gesell. The notes ranged from
requests for paper clips to a plea for a nurse to monitor the high
blood pressure of a juror.
   Meanwhile, 10 news organizations including The Associated Press
said in a court filing they should be allowed to seek disclosure of
a document in the case.
   Gesell said in an April 22 ruling that the document is
classified. It summarizes highly sensitive intelligence on a
CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran in
November 1985.
   The document is being shown to the jury, but withheld from the
public at the request of the National Security Agency, the super
secret agency which collected the intelligence intercepts.
   Numerous court decisions ``have recognized that the press has
standing to assert rights of public access to proceedings and
records in criminal cases,'' said the court filing.
   Gesell has been directed by an appeals court to compile a record
spelling out national security concerns over possible disclosure of
the document. North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in
closing arguments, but the NSA says the document itself must remain
under seal.
   North used the stipulation to show CIA director William Casey
and deputy national security adviser John Poindexter knew at the
time that missiles were aboard the flight, yet agreed to cover up
their knowledge from Congress.
   The other news organizations seeking disclosure are Cable News
Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.; Dow Jones &amp; Co.
Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National Public Radio; the
New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co. and The Washington Post.
