My dentist -- Sweeney Todd, DDS -- had his receptionist phone me to say that I 
should come in for an appointment. I figured Sweeney was having cash-flow 
problems again. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it this time?" I asked the receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
"He says that he was looking at your X-rays, and you need a crown in the lower 
left something or other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean what is it with me," I said. "What is it with him? Did the kid's 
college tuition bill just come in? Would you mind just shouting back there and 
asking him how much he owes for what? I'd like to get myself prepared." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't," the receptionist said. "He's in the Caribbean until next Tuesday. 
Before he left, he gave me a list of patients to call. He told me that he'll 
need you for an hour on the first appointment." 
</P>
<P>
"An hour on the first appointment?" I said. "Sounds like Jamaica. Or maybe 
Antigua. This is definitely no cheapie to the Bahamas. That time he went to the 
Bahamas he only needed me for a half-hour session with the dental hygienist. 
May I ask if he took the wife and kids?" 
</P>
<P>
"And his in-laws," the receptionist said. 
</P>
<P>
"Erghh," I said, with some feeling. "I think we're talking gold crown here. 
Maybe even root canal." 
</P>
<P>
I showed up for the hour appointment anyway. What's the alternative? I don't 
think I'm up to auto-dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
I could switch dentists, of course, but I've become sort of used to old 
Sweeney. I'd feel something was missing if a dentist didn't accompany his 
drilling with a lot of talk about how much electricians charge for a simple 
rewiring job these days. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I don't know any other dentists. I don't admit that to Sweeney Todd, 
DDS, of course. In fact, I've been telling him for years that some friends of 
mine are always singing the praises of the dentist they all go to, a relatively 
recent arrival from Kyoto known to his grateful patients as Magic Fingers 
Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
"They say he's got the touch of an angel," I said of Yamamoto, as I settled 
into the chair and prepared for the assaults of a deeply tanned Sweeney Todd, 
DDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Open wide, please," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, Yamamoto belongs to some sect that believes the exchange of large sums 
of money corrupts the soul," I continued. "For crowns and bridges, he does 
wonders with the same material used for the common paper clip. His fees, of 
course, are nominal. Basically, he seeks his rewards in inner fulfillment. He 
spits on money -- or he would if he weren't so polite." 
</P>
<P>
"Spit, please," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney had stopped his banging around and was standing next to his instrument 
cabinet peering at some X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you see there, Sweeney?" I asked. "A new transmission for your BMW? A 
long weekend with the missus in the Adirondacks?" 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney held the X-rays up to the window to get a better look. "Won't be able 
to get away for the next few weekends," Sweeney said. "We're doing an addition 
to the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
"You never cease to amaze me, Sweeney," I said. "I've seen those television 
commercials that show doctors seeing all sorts of little bitty doodads through 
the miracle of CAT scans -- or not seeing them, really, because all of the 
patients in those commercials turn out to be OK -- but you've got to be the 
only medical man who can look at an X-ray with the naked eye and see an 
addition to your kitchen. What's your secret?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have a better X-ray machine," Sweeney said, knocking over the water glass as 
he turned toward me, "but it's expensive. Very expensive. Open wide, please."
