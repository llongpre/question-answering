   A widely publicized proposal for cutting
Social Security taxes apparently is not grabbing the attention of
voters and has little support among Senate tax-writers.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King said the agency's
toll-free number had received only about 60 calls on the tax cut
since it was proposed in late December by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``I don't find a lot of support in my state for cutting payroll
taxes,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Monday as
the Senate Finance Committee opened the first congressional hearing
on the bill. He said the subject has not come up at his public
meetings in Kansas and that his office has received only two
letters on the subject.
   Members of the committee praised Moynihan for turning the
spotlight on the way surplus Social Security taxes are being used
``for general government needs _ from aircraft carriers to paper
clips.'' But no one offered a solid endorsement of the bill.
   ``Not a good idea,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said of the
bill. ``A tax cut would be disastrous'' for future retirees, added
Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., agreed with Moynihan that Social
Security surpluses should not mask the true size of the deficit but
said the tax cut ``would almost certainly bankrupt Social Security
in short order.''
   Democrats treated the proposal more gently. ``This may be the
best answer we can find'' to stop the use of Social Security taxes
to cut the budget deficit, said Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., who added
he has not made a decision.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said use
of Social Security surpluses for deficit reduction can no longer be
ignored, but did not recommend how the problem can be corrected.
   Robert J. Myers, who helped create the system in 1934 and was
its chief actuary for 23 years, endorsed the reduction.
   ``The time has arrived when the financing of the Old Age,
Survivors and Disability Insurance program should be rationalized,
stabilized and made crystal clear by going to a pay-as-you-go
basis, as proposed by Senator Moynihan,'' Myers told the committee.
   Moynihan wants to eliminate the surpluses by rolling back the
rate tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and by cutting the rate
again next year, to 6.55 percent. The rate now is 7.65 percent of
the first $51,300 earned; employers match contributions from the
132 million employees.
   Congress and the Reagan administration planned for the Social
Security surpluses to grow by $1 billion a week when they
overhauled the system in 1983 to ensure benefits will be financed
when the large generation born soon after World War II begins
retiring in about 2012.
   Under the law, the surpluses must be invested in government
securities, which will have to be redeemed in the future to finance
benefits. But the surplus taxes are actually being used to finance
general government spending and to hide the true size of the budget
deficit.
   Robert M. Ball, Social Security commissioner from 1962 to 1973,
said if Congress eliminates the surpluses, the money should be
transferred into the Medicare hospitalization fund _ not used for
tax cuts.
   The Bush administration vigorously opposes the cut as a threat
to benefits and an opening for increases in other taxes.
Nevertheless, Social Security Commissioner King told the hearing,
``the administration is open to every reasonable alternative'' so
long as any change does not upset ``the sound financial footing ...
of the last seven years.''
   Bush said last month that Moynihan's bill is ``a disguise for
increased taxes around the corner.''
   The president wants to do nothing about the surpluses until the
federal budget is balanced _ 1993 at the earliest _ and then to use
surplus Social Security taxes only for debt reduction.
