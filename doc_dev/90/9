   Boris Yeltsin, who first proposed a joint SDI program with
the U.S., is looking for a solution to another nuclear threat
on his -- and our -- hands. What to do with the Russian
nuclear engineers and scientists who reportedly are getting
lucrative offers to relocate to Third World capitals? Russian
academic Evygeny Belikov says that while top scientists
aren't hopping on planes just yet, the country's nuclear
brain trust of some 3,000 people has a network of unsavory
contacts. It was the Russians, for example, who worked on
fusion for Moammar Gadhafi. Russians can use the threat of
rogue scientists as a sales pitch for Western financial aid,
but we have a better idea: Operation Paper Clip. After the
Second World War, Britain and the U.S. cooperated in this
program to buy off, de-Nazify and relocate Hitler's
rocket-builders, including Wernher von Braun. Let's do it
again, for Russians. The cost could be low considering that
Moscow pays even its best nuclear scientists about $100 a
month at the ruble's current depressed rate. Ignoring the
opportunity could mean facing the results of Ivan Rocket
Scientist's work from Baghdad or Tripoli.
