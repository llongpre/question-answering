<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
20 April] 
  [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] has 
established a number of counting centres around the country, 
each of which so positioned and allocated to count approximately 
60,000 papers. Naturally, counting centres serving smaller 
rural areas will serve more voting stations than those in 
larger, urban areas. 
  Security--both within and around the counting centres, will 
be of prime importance, and access to counting centres will be 
restricted--against positive identification--to certain IEC 
personnel, IEC monitors, party voting agents, local and 
international observers and one candidate from each registered 
political party. 
  On the morning of April 29 (the day after close of 
voting)--all "packages"--ballot boxes, parcels and other items 
sealed at voting stations--will be delivered to their allocated 
counting centres, accompanied in transit by at least two IEC 
officials, or one IEC official and an official or international 
observer. The additional presence of an IEC monitor where 
possible is being encouraged. 
  The counting officer at the counting centre will, in the 
presence of another IEC official and any other interested 
parties who have access to the station, inspect the seals on the 
packages. 
  The counting officer will then instruct the two designated 
IEC officials to separate the packages into those for provincial 
votes, and those for national. These will then be taken to 
separate national or provincial "bins" or holding areas for each 
voting station, and further separated into the three days of 
voting -- April 26,27 and 28. 
  This procedure will be followed until all of the packages 
from all of the voting stations allocated to a counting centre 
have been received. 
  Eighteen reconciliation tables -- nine for provincial votes, 
and nine for national votes -- will be positioned in each 
counting centre, each group of three tables processing votes for 
each of the three voting days in each category. Each of these 
tables will have an IEC official assigned to it, and a further 
two IEC official will supervise the overall reconciliation 
process. 
  Packages will then be allocated from the bins to available 
reconciliation tables, three voting stations at a time (one for 
each set of three reconciliation tables). The IEC official at 
each table will break the seals on the ballot boxes, and place 
the ballot papers on the table before showing any interested 
parties that the box is empty. He or she will then count and 
record the number of ballot papers on the table, in small 
batches of twenty, clipped together in batches of 100 papers. 
  In any one of the ballot boxes from a particular voting 
station will also be the statement prepared by the voting 
station presiding officer, detailing the number of votes cast on 
a particular voting day at that station. 
  The IEC station reconciliation supervisor will be called 
upon 
to check the presiding officer's statement against that of the 
IEC counting station officer. If the figures do not agree 
(after checking addition calculations on both forms) a recount 
will be ordered and undertaken until the total after two 
identical and consecutive counts agree with each other. 
  If this total differs from the presiding officer's statement 
by less than 0.5 per cent or one vote -- whichever is the 
greater -- the reconciliation will be regarded as being in order. 
  If the margin is greater than this, the supervisor will 
comply with the instructions of the IEC's chief director, 
administration. 
  Any and all irregularities -- no matter how great or small 
-- 
will however be reported to the IEC chief director, 
administration, on completion of the counting process. 
  On completion of the reconciliation, ballot papers will be 
returned to ballot boxes, sealed by the counting supervisor, 
have the reconciliation statement stuck to the boxes and taken 
to a further holding area to await counting. 
  The counting proper -- by political party -- begins at this 
stage. Boxes containing no more than 3,000 papers are delivered 
to a counting table, where the allocated IEC official again 
checks the seals before breaking these and removing the contents 
and proving that the box is empty. 
  All packets containing ballot papers without the relevant 
voting station stamp, those cancelled by the voting station 
presiding officer as being marked by mistake or inadvertently 
spoiled at the voting station, as well as used and 
partially-used ballot books returned by the voting station will 
then be placed in one of the ballot boxes, together with the 
counting station reconciliation form(s), and sealed under 
supervision. 
  The remaining ballot papers left on the counting table are 
then held up -- one at a time -- and shown to the party voting 
agents, monitors and observers present. If the mark on the 
paper is clearly identifiable as being in support of a certain 
party, the official will call out the name of that party, and 
hand the paper to one of the five IEC official controlling the 
party allocation tables, where piles of votes for each party are 
assembled. 
  If the mark is not clearly identifiable as being in support 
of a particular party, it will be put aside and treated as a 
disputed ballot paper after processing the other papers in that 
batch. 
  Disputed papers will then again be held up one at a time to 
party voting agents, monitors and observers, and the supervisor 
will announce his or her decision on whether to accept or reject 
each one. In the case of acceptance, the supervisor will give 
his or her decision on the party selected. 
  If this decision is accepted, the supervisor will hand the 
paper to one of the five party allocation table officials, who 
will add it to the pile for that particular party. If the 
supervisor's decision is rejected by party voting agents, the 
paper will be marked as "disputed and counted/rejected" on its 
reverse and kept separately. 
  Each of the officials at the party allocation tables will 
then count and record the ballots in each of the party piles to 
which they have been allocated -- again in small clips of twenty 
papers collated into batches of 100 papers. 
  "Disputed and counted" and "disputed and rejected" papers 
will also be counted, clipped and batched as above, and a 
separate record kept of these tallies. 
  Officials at each party allocation tables will them swop 
positions under the direction of the supervisor, and the 
counting and recording at each table will be repeated. Finally, 
the official at the counting table who did not participate in 
the previous party allocation counts will again count and record 
the results. 
  This process will be repeated until the results of two 
consecutive counts are identical in every respect. 
  Full results of the count -- including rejected ballots -- 
are recorded on a batch tally form, and the supervisor will read 
out the result and ask any party voting agents present to sign 
this form. 
  Should there be a dispute, and provided the party voting 
agent has solid grounds for the dispute, a re-count may be 
ordered. 
  Once the form is signed by the party voting agents, it will 
be regarded as being accepted, and no further appeal will be 
entertained by the IEC. Copies of the signed batch tally forms 
will be available to all party voting agents. 
  The counting table officials will then assemble the 
different 
categories of ballots into packets, each of which will be sealed 
and returned to empty ballot boxes, together with the batch 
tally forms. The ballot boxes are once again sealed and removed 
to a holding area. 
  The counting officer will convey results of the batch tally 
forms to the IEC media centre in Johannesburg. 
  All material pertaining to the count-ballot papers, stubs 
unused papers, reports and forms -- will them be assembled in a 
holding area at the counting centre. The counting officer will 
request that all people other than the required IEC officers 
leave the centre, and will secure the centre to his or her 
satisfaction until arrangements are made for delivery of the 
material to the IEC's chief director, administration.
