   A group of children used a playground as
headquarters for a make-believe drug ring, selling neatly packaged
bags of sugar and grass clippings that looked like cocaine and
marijuana, police said Wednesday.
   ``I think the whole thing is very tragic. Normally they play
fireman or policeman. It's tragic when they want to grow up and be
drug dealers,'' said city Councilman Peter Zug.
   Authorities speculated that the children _ who were believed to
be 12 or younger _ were either emulating their parents or being
trained for the drug business.
   ``I was shocked and depressed,'' said Detective Thomas Capello,
looking through a tackle box stacked with bogus drugs and colored
slips of paper detailing the group's transactions.
   ``I think they were doing this as a game with other kids, but it
was a very serious game,'' Capello said.
   The tackle box was turned over to police last week after two
children, ages 7 and 9, found it in a tree at the dilapidated
downtown playground, which neighbors said had been closed for at
least two years. The playground in the city east of Harrisburg
borders an area of the city known for drug use, officials said.
   Police had not interviewed any children in the case but said
they had five names from reading ledger notes in the box and
intended to speak with the youngsters Thursday.
   ``It was sophisticated packaging; they were maintaining a list
of buyers, money spent and money owed. ... I was totally shocked,''
said Chief Michael DeLeo.
   ``What concerns me is the age category we're dealing with. We
must do something to save the next generation,'' he said.
   Also in the tackle box was 52 cents and detailed lists of
product prices and sizes. On one slip, cocaine was misspelled
``cocain.'' A small bag of the bogus cocaine was priced at 55
cents. The small bags of grass clippings were priced at $1.
   Officials said the grass clipping and sugar were not illegal,
but selling them under the pretense of being drugs would be. They
said their primary concern was that the children receive counseling.
   ``There absolutely needs to be discussions with them to teach
them about drugs and the tragedy that can come from drugs,'' Zug
said.
