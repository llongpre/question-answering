<LEADPARA>  MY FRIEND the congressman seemed upset when I mentioned a small fact he didn't
know about U.S. weapons sales in the Mideast, an area in which he considers
himself an expert. "How did you find that out?" he asked.;     "Well, it's not
a secret," I said, laughing. "There was a piece about it in the New York Times
the day before yesterday."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Dammit," he said. "No one clipped that for me.";    That is the way busy
people live these days, isn't it? They don't read the papers; the staff reads
for them and clips whatever seems relevant or important. They don't watch
television news; they're rarely home early enough to do that, and they can get
a cassette of anything they need, including themselves if they were
interviewed or something.;    They get out-of-town clippings by fax and
background from Nexis. In the White House, the Treasury, the Pentagon, the
International Monetary Fund, they get their own daily newspapers, masses of
photocopied clippings from several newspapers and little summaries of
television news that magically appear on desks each workday.;    As kings and
princes once had food-tasters to protect them against poisoning, men and women
of power and responsibility these days have news-tasters to protect them
against . . . against what? Reality, I suppose, or maybe just the ink that
seems to come off newspapers easier than it did in the old days.;    Magazines
are being replaced by newsletters -- most of the little help-wanted ads in the
National Press Club bulletin are for newsletter editors -- with information
not only tasted but predigested for those too busy to deal in complete
sentences. Instead of listening to the radio, even all-news radio, they can
get little devices that beep an alarm and turn on only when the next news-bit
concerns a subject the listener has preprogrammed to his or her personal or
financial interests.;    Time, valuable time;  Why, after all, waste valuable
time on floods in Bangladesh or firefights in Yugoslavia? In fact, if either
of those countries disappears -- a real possibility -- why should busy we be
bothered?;    Aren't we all "need to know" people now?;    We may have peaked
now in mass information, the number of people knowing the same thing at the
same time. Global village, and all that. The history of civilization and the
story of freedom can be told and calculated by the speed and reach of
information transmission and distribution.;    It was less than 150 years ago
that information could move no faster than horses or sailing ships -- except
for the limited "one if by land, two if by sea" communication by lanterns in
church steeples or fires on hilltops. Then came trains, the telegraph, radio,
telephone lines, communications satellites and CNN.;    Back to villages;  Now
we can use high technology to revert to a globe of villages -- not
geographical now, just people huddled together in small self-selected and
self-defined groups knowing only what they want to know when they want to know
it.;    We will call it progress, of course. But what we may be progressing
along is a slippery slope back into darker ages where news and information do
not unite and enrich people but separate them again into haves and have-nots
of knowledge.;     SUMMARY; (box) People are; too busy to; read nowadays;
