<LEADPARA>  THE one thing Ivana Trump should have included in her pre-nuptial agreement
was a clause on job security.;    At this date, Ivana is still the president
of her ex-husband's Plaza Hotel -- still a high-salaried employee. But now
that the Trumps are no longer wed, will their rancorous personal relationship
put the kibosh on Ivana's career as hotelier?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I really haven't made that determination yet," said The Donald.;    When
you're married to the boss, or a co-worker, divorce delivers a double whammy.
Who stays? Who goes? How do you behave in the office?;    Deciding to pack up
the paper clips and move on when an office relationship collapses isn't always
an option.;    With jobs scarce, many people are unwilling to part with their
salary simply to avoid bumping into an ex-significant other over a
spreadsheet.;    "It's a troublesome decision, but in the long run, I'd say
it's not wise to stay on the job together," says Sandra Kahn, a marriage and
family therapist in New York. "The almighty dollar just ain't worth it.";   
For some people, it is. When John and Margaret Gardiner separated a year ago,
their big issue was deciding who owned what percentage of the New York
employment agency they ran together. Neither wanted to sell out and start
over.;    But their daily in-office squabbling nearly caused the firm to shut
down. Long-time employees, treated to front-row seats at the Gardiner
insult-fests, quit en masse.;    "I don't blame them," says Gardiner, a New
Jersey native. "Margaret and I would scream at each other all day about how
incompetent the other was." The couple later divorced.;    This scene is not
all that rare, says Manhattan lawyer Cecile Weich, who handles about 10 cases
of co-worker divorce each year.;    "When you put men and women in the
workplace together you're going to have sex, affairs and marriage," says
Weich. "And ultimately, you're going to have divorce.";    Elizabeth Snead's
ex-husband was her supervisor at the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, where she
is a fashion writer. It caused a stir.;    But being ex-mates didn't put the
hex on them as co-workers. "Everyone thought there would be major fireworks,"
says Snead. "It never bothered us.";    Simon &amp; Schuster's Joni Evans and
Richard Snyder behaved professionally, too, during their rancorous 1987
divorce. While bitterly warring on the home front, Evans, an editor at S&amp;S,
and Snyder, the company president, worked peaceably side-by-side for more than
a year.;    "We can go through a meeting together or have a wonderful
conversation on the phone about (work)," Evans said at the time, "when the
last words to each other that morning were 'Drop dead! I hate you. I'll never
speak to you again.' ";    If the situation becomes so intolerable that one
estranged partner must leave the firm, which one goes?;    Evans vacated her
job at Simon &amp; Schuster just months before her divorce was granted. The
incentive? A plum position at Random House, a rival publishing house.;    Most
women aren't so lucky, says Sandra Kahn. "Face it, there is no equality in the
work place," she says. "The man is probably going to be higher-paid and have
the better job. The wife will not be bargaining from a position of power.";   
Gardiner's wife ended up accepting a cash settlement for her share (49
percent) of the employment agency her ex-husband still runs.;    Some would
say she got the better deal. "The partner who takes a powder may actually reap
the higher reward," says Kahn. "They free themselves of daily emotional pain,
and that's worth more than gold."  </TEXT>
