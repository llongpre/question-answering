New York City Ballet's Balanchine Celebration, about which Clement Crisp
wrote in its early stages, came to a triumphant end on Sunday with a gala
performance that began at 4 in the afternoon and lasted until 10.30 in the
evening, with intermissions when cocktails and zakouski (Russian hors
d'oeuvres) or American dessert (brownies and carrot cake) were served, and a
longer break when you could get a box supper prepared according to
Balanchine's own recipes.
As for the dancing, the programme reprised the chronological format of the
season as a whole, but with an international flavour to illustrate the fact
that Balanchine generously gave his ballets to companies all over the world.
Guest artists from the Kirov, the Paris Opera, the Royal Ballet, American
Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific
Northwest Ballet (Seattle) appeared alongside City Ballet dancers.
Thus, there was a multinational Apollo with the Danish/American Nilas
Martins and Zhanna Ayupova (Kirov), Patricia Barker (Seattle) and Isabelle
Guerin (Paris) as his muses. The sensation of the evening was Darcy Bussell
in the pas de deux from Agon (with Lindsay Fischer), proving that she is a
born Balanchine dancer. In Who Cares? Viviana Durante danced 'The Man I
Love' with Robert LaFosse and Elizabeth Loscavio (San Francisco) spun
vertiginously through 'My One and Only.' At the end dancers and audience
joined in a vodka toast to Mr B. The waiter with the drinks for Peter
Martins, Lincoln Kirstein and Jerome Robbins was none other than Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
As Clement Crisp indicated, the heroines of this extraordinary marathon were
Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler, to whom I would add Nichol Hlinka, who gave
a delicious account of Donizetti Variations with Nikolaj Haabbe, the
company's latest Danish recruit and of Columbine in Harlequinade, opposite a
mercurial Damian Woetzel, and, with Peter Boal, realised all the tragic
poetry of the Divertimento from 'Le Baiser de la fee'. It must be added that
some ballets were sadly undercast, most conspicuously when Nilas Martins,
the son of Peter Martins, ballet master in chief, attempted roles like
Orpheus and Apollo.
There is a dwindling number of dancers in the principal ranks who knew
Balanchine. The next generation will come from the School of American
Ballet, whose senior students also danced a selection of Balanchine excerpts
in this year's 'Workshop' performances, as well as one complete ballet,
Symphonie Concertante, in acknowledgment of the fact that it was originally
made for the school, in 1945. Nearly 50 years later, the very promising
Rachel Rutherford and Tara Keim danced the leading roles. Rutherford,
partnered by the elegant Peter Hansen, was also ravishing in 'Tales from the
Vienna Woods' from Vienna Waltzes.
Symphonie Concertante was also in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre
this year at the Metropolitan Opera House. Kevin McKenzie, the highly
respected dancer who has taken over the artistic direction, announced before
the season that he intended to take the company back to its old policy of
emphasising the 'theatre' aspect of the company's title. No brand-new works
were given, but the company took into its repertory Kenneth MacMillan's
Manon and Christian Holder's Les Liaisons dangereuses. Concerning the
latter, I can only echo Clement Crisp's remark about Glen Tetley's La Ronde:
'it lasts - was that all? - 50 minutes.' Manon is probably the best of
MacMillan's full-length ballets, certainly the one most accessible to
companies other than the Royal Ballet. Alessandra Ferri and Cynthia Harvey
have both danced the title role there, and are thoroughly at home in it.
Ferri was partnered by Julio Bocca, not the subtlest of dance actors. But
the supporting company, led by such artists as Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace
(who both danced Lescaut), Kathleen Moore, Victor Barbee, and Ethan Brown,
showed that they can form an acting ensemble worthy of comparison with the
Royal Ballet itself.
The revival of David Blair's production of Swan Lake looked rather dated,
but it is at least a straightforward rendering of the traditional
choreography. Nina Ananiashvili and Bocca gave it the old fashioned star
treatment, neither to their own nor to the ballet's advantage. Otherwise, it
was the ballets with the highest dance values that came off best, notably
Ashton's Symphonic Variations and Mark Morris's Drink to me only with thine
eyes.
Another Mark Morris work was seen in the brief season at the City Center of
Les Grands Ballets Canadiens: Paukenschlag, to Haydn's Symphony No. 94 (the
'Surprise'). Morris is sometimes criticised for being too close to the
music, but what he does in a ballet like this is wittily and inventively to
clarify the music's structure.
Morris has been busily turning out new pieces for his own company, which
will be seen later in the summer at Edinburgh.
