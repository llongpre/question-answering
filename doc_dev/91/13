<LEADPARA>  THE NEW American Ballet Theater and the bad old ABT jockeyed for supremacy at
the company's opening Tuesday, parading a most discomfiting case of artistic
split personality to the gala crowd.;    On the one hand, there was "Ballet
Imperial," a piece of routine Balanchine, in a slipshod performance that
looked as if the corps had last rehearsed it a year ago.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On the other, there was the commanding "Sinfonietta," a 1978 work by Czech
choreographer Jiri Kylian, just acquired by ABT for the current season.;   
And in between, there was "Other Dances," an exquisite Jerome Robbins
miniature, danced to perfection but programmed for the wrong reasons.;    It's
not fashionable to like the neo-romantic Kylian these days, but I love his
gleaming physical response to complex music. This piece, like "Forgotten Land"
(in San Francisco Ballet's repertory), is set in a wide, allusive landscape,
which it pulls down to human scale by discovering real emotions in its
abstract world.;    "Sinfonietta" calls for a chamber company of seven couples
-- small forces to challenge the brooding, brass-heavy score by Kylian's
countryman, Leos Janacek. This magnificent piece calls for 25 brass players,
including 12 (!) trumpets. Unfortunately, either there weren't enough strings
for all this brazen glory, or else the pit muffled them. The performance,
though sensitively led by Jack Everly, seemed a bit thin.;    Kylian's dancers
shape this sound into movement with a breathtaking combination of exuberance
and yearning, their springy, sinewy leaps seemingly suspended in mid-air.
Unlike "Forgotten Land," whose movements come from the ebb and flow of the
tide against the shore, this piece is grounded in the earth's energy -- like
the mythological giant Antaeus, who literally renewed his strength every time
he made contact with his mother, Gaia (the earth).;    Everything about the
piece added to its powerful beauty, from the performances -- all so resonant
that I can't single any out -- to the simple, almost monastic costumes (by
Walter Nobbe) to the aquarelle backdrop (also by Nobbe). Under Joop Caboort's
lighting, this striated, horizontal landscape was sometimes arid, sometimes
verdant.;    "Other Dances" replaced Mark Morris' wonderful "Drink to Me Only
With Thine Eyes" because the estate of the woman who commissioned the former
work in 1976 -- the retired ballerina Eugenia Delarova Doll, who died last
year -- just gave $250,000 to ABT. Money not only talks, it seems, but also
sometimes dances.;    However, barring the slavishness of the gesture, it's a
lovely suite for two well-tuned dancers -- here, Alessandra Ferri and Julio
Bocca, worthy successors to Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, for whom
it was made.;    Paul Connelly, who is one of the conductors vying for the San
Jose Symphony post, played the score -- four mazurkas and a waltz by Chopin --
beautifully, though one wished the piano had been as well tuned as the
dancers.;    Let's not dwell on "Ballet Imperial" (1941), except to say that
Susan Jaffe was the only real dancer on stage. Jaffe, who is married to
Connelly, substituted for the indisposed Cynthia Harvey.;    I don't know what
those other 30 folks were doing up there, except going through the motions.
Ricardo Bustamante, the cavalier, performed with a long-suffering expression,
while poor Amanda McKerrow, a charming dancer, was imprisoned in a pink tutu
that washed out her pale coloring.;    The rest of the ballet suits its score,
Tchaikovsky's grand and empty Piano Concerto No. 2. Instead of taking a bow,
pianist Michael Boriskin should have spent intermission in the pit with a
broom, sweeping up all the notes he dropped.;    ABT's revival of "Coppelia"
-- Enrique Martinez's 1968 choreography gussied up with new sets and costumes
-- opens tonight. The company performs in San Francisco through April 7.; 
American Ballet Theater; 'Coppelia'; When: 8 tonight-Friday, 2 and 8 p.m.
Saturday-Sunday; Where: War Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., San
Francisco; Tickets: $15-$65. (415) 621-3838  </TEXT>
