<LEADPARA>  THE trouble with anniversaries is that the day after each one is the first day
of the rest of your life. American Ballet Theater, which will play San
Francisco this week and next, found this out after its 25th, its 30th, its
40th and last year after its 50th birthday.;    This is the off-year: an
asymmetrical, unround 51. It's a year of questions about identity and artistic
direction, and, of course, financial woes. (So how is that different from any
other dance company in America?)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The finances have had more impact than the company likes to admit. Once the
most traveled ballet in the world, ABT has pulled back its tours to just a few
key cities. Its repertory, geared to splashy, big-budget ballets for
star-struck audiences, is even less consequential than in some other years:
The company can't afford to challenge its patrons.;    The question of
artistic leadership continues to bedevil ABT. Ever since Mikhail Baryshnikov
quit in a huff just as plans for the 50th-anniversary gala were set in motion,
the dance world has wondered who is running the company. It is, in fact, being
run by co-director Jane Hermann, but no one wants to believe this is more than
a temporary situation -- except Hermann, an arts administrator who; controls
casting and chooses repertory as if she had come up through the ranks of
dance.;    In the meantime, many of the promises made last fall, when ABT
announced its San Francisco season, have melted. The roster of guests is down
to just one: Sylvie Guillem, the long-stemmed French ballerina who will make
her ABT debut as the company plays San Francisco and Orange County. Farukh
Ruzimatov of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet, announced with fanfare, isn't coming.
Andris Liepa of the Bolshoi Ballet parted company with Hermann more than a
year ago and went back to the Soviet Union.;    Because principal dancer Clark
Tippet is not well, his new ballet isn't ready, and he is the only in-house
choreographer in the company, which once presented the newest ballets of major
choreographers before the ink had dried.;    The repertory for the 1991 tour
includes two full-length ballets: the charming "Coppelia" (Thursday-next
Sunday) and the languorous "La Bayadere" ("The Temple Dancer") (April 5-7).;  
 "Coppelia," a favorite of San Jose Cleveland Ballet audiences, who saw it in
1989 and 1990, is a comic ballet about a life-size mechanical doll who causes
havoc between the lovers Franz and Swanilda.;    This production is billed as
"new," but it's a revival of the 1968 staging by ballet master emeritus
Enrique Martinez, after Arthur St.-Leon's 1870 original. The music is by Leo
Delibes. There are new costumes and scenery by Tony Award-winning designers
Patricia Zipprodt ("Sweet Charity" and "Cabaret") and Tony Straiges ("Into the
Woods" and "Sunday in the Park With George").;    The roles of Swanilda and
Franz will be danced by Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca (Thursday and Saturday);
Amanda McKerrow and Danilo Radojevic (Friday); Cynthia Harvey and Wes Chapman
(Saturday matinee); Marianna Tcherkassky and Johan Renvall (next Sunday's
matinee); and Cynthia Gregory and Jeremy Collins (next Sunday evening).;   
Dr. Coppelius, the crackpot toy-maker who has built the almost-human doll,
traditionally steals the show, and he probably will next Sunday night, when
Michael Smuin, former director of San Francisco Ballet, returns to his ABT
roots to perform the role. Coppelius also will be performed by Terrence Orr,
Gil Boggs and Victor Barbee.;    "La Bayadere" is a revival of Natalia
Makarova's staging, which when new was the first full-length production of
this classic Russian imperial ballet to be performed by a Western company. Its
showpiece is the opening of Act II, "The Kingdom of the Shades," whose slow,
repeated arabesques are a litmus test for the women of the corps. Many people
who know little about ballet will recognize this sequence, for it was the
image that ran beneath the title credits of the film "The Turning Point.";   
Guillem will dance the title role, with Kevin McKenzie as her lover and Susan
Jaffe as the wicked Gamzatti, April 5. Other casts are: Tcherkassky, Radojevic
and Harvey (April 6 matinee and April 7 evening); Jaffe, Ricardo Bustamante
and Leslie Browne (April 6); McKerrow, Chapman and Christine Dunham (April 7
matinee).;    The company's mixed repertory has been kept reasonably compact
for this tour: two programs, with one alteration in the second.;    The first,
to be seen Tuesday and Wednesday, includes Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial," a
tribute to the Russian tradition, set to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1;
Mark Morris' "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes," a beautiful company
showpiece, which replaces Tippet's unfinished ballet; and Jiri Kylian's
setting of Leos Janacek's virile "Sinfonietta.";    The second, to be seen
April 2-4, includes Sir Kenneth MacMillan's "Concerto," to music of Dmitri
Shostakovich; and Twyla Tharp's "Brief Fling." On April 2 and 4, the program
will include "Fall River Legend," Agnes de Mille's dramatic retelling of the
Lizzie Borden story; on April 3, the program will finish with Act II (the swan
scene) of "Swan Lake," in David Blair's 1966 setting.;    Cynthia Gregory, who
often performs with San Jose Cleveland Ballet as a guest artist, will dance
the Swan Queen, with Peter Morrison as the Prince and Michael Owen as
Rothbart, the sorcerer. She will also play Lizzie in the April 4 performance
of "Fall River Legend." The cast for April 2 is yet to be announced.;   
Opening night of "Coppelia" is a benefit for ABT, with the top tickets priced
at $150-$200. For these special tickets, which include pre- and
post-performance events, call (212) 477-3030.;    The April 2 mixed-rep
performance is a benefit for six Bay Area AIDS relief agencies. Tickets are
$20-$500, available from (415) 621-6557. (box);  American Ballet Theater;
