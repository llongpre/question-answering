   The first Hans Christian Andersen
Ballet Performance Awards were presented Saturday during an
international performance at the Danish Royal Theater.
   Top awards went to Sylvie Guillem of the Paris Opera Ballet and
Irek Mukhamedov of the Soviet's Bolshoi Ballet.
   Ms. Guillem won the award for the best female performance in her
role as Odile-Odette in ``Swan Lake.'' Mukhamedov was selected as
best male performer for the role as ``Spartacus''.
   They were selected from dancers nominated by 38 ballet companies
in 22 countries.
   The H.C. Andersen Choreography Award was presented to Jiri
Kylian, artistic director of the Netherlands Dance Theater for his
choreography of ``L'Enfent et les Sortileges.'' Three Awards of
Merit were announced. They went to Frederick Ashton, leader of the
London Royal Ballet, and to Jerome Robbins and Peter Martins,
co-directors of the New York City Ballet.
   Dancers from various ballet troupes performed Saturday night.
   Ms. Guillem and Manuel Legris of the Paris Opera Ballet danced
the ``Grand Pas Classique.'' The Bolshoi's Mukhamedov and Natalia
Bessmertnova performed an excerpt from ``Spartacus.''
   Two dancers from the Beijing Ballet, Li Ying and Pang Jiabin,
presented a section of August Bournonville's ``The Flower Festival
at Genzano.''
   Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca of the American Ballet Theater
performed the pas de deux from ``Don Quixote''.
   The awards are named after fairy-tale master Hans Christian
Andersen. He was a friend of Bournonville, the famed 19th century
Danish choreographer.
   Many of Anderson's tales were the inspiration for ballets. For a
few years, he was a member of the ballet corps at the Danish Royal
Opera but was dismissed on grounds that his feet were too big.
   The awards are to be presented annually.
