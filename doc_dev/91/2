  [Text] The mission of the international observers in Hebron 
is now under way. This is the first operation of its type in 
the territories occupied by Israel. Giovanni Bocco reports: 
  [Bocco] It was a lightning visit by the delegation of 
international observers in Hebron. Two officers from the 
Italian carabinieri force were also present. They spoke with 
the Palestinian mayor of the city and with the Israelis about 
the organizational aspects of the mandate. 
  There will be 35 Italian observers, but only 15 will be 
permanently stationed in Hebron. After leaving the private 
room, the negotiators entered the council chamber, which was 
full of people. There was a handshake between the mayor, a UN 
delegate, and Yitzhaq Rabin's representative. However, the 
smiles did not hide the fact that there were still many things 
to be decided. The two Italian delegates are Colonel Pietro 
Pistolese and Major Giovanni Trullio. They come from the 
Tuscagna carabinieri parachute regiment, which has already seen 
action in Somalia as part of the Ibis mission. Here is the head 
of the Italian delegation, Colonel Pistolese: 
  [Pistolese] This is the first contact... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] Have you overcome the obstacle of 
security? 
  [Pistolese] No. For the moment there are no security 
problems. We are welcomed and we hope to be good guests. 
  [Bocco] Will you be completely disarmed. I have heard that 
this will be so? 
  [Pistolese] We are working on this. We are just at the 
beginning of our mandate. It is premature... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] How do you think that this meeting has 
gone? 
  [Pistolese] Well. 
  [Bocco] The 160 UN observers: 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes, and 
35 
Italians will have to operate in a difficult situation. Hebron 
is a fortress of the Islamic fundamentalists, but four 
kilometers away there is a colony of some 5,000 Jewish settlers. 
Friction is the order of the day.
