   A University of Oregon senior faces a
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay.
   Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He
suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are
scheduled.
   ``The emotion did slip,'' Sebastian said about the letter, which
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free
speech. ``But that doesn't change the feelings that I felt.''
   After Municipal Judge Frank Bocci read the letter, he ordered
Sebastian to show cause why he shouldn't be held in contempt ``for
disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and
court.''
   Now Sebastian faces the prospect of a $25 fine or 10 days in jail.
   ``I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the
court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' Bocci
said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on
the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for
writing a letter.
   The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge Jim Spickerman
after Bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias.
   Floyd Prozanski Jr., a city prosecutor, admitted there were no
Oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in New Jersey
that appeared to offer some guidance.
   However, defense attorney Steve Chez cited another New Jersey
case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets:
   ``Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster,
   Can't pass what is called constitutional muster.
   Use of vulgar words that may cause resentment,
   Is protected by the First Amendment.''
   A decision is expected next week.
