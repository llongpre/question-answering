<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League representative </F>
Gianfranco Miglio by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: 
"Miglio Throws In the Towel: `No Hope for Italy'"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Passalacqua] 
Professor, Bossi is abandoning federalism in order to attract 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. What do you think of that? 
  [Miglio] I do not criticize him. I go even further. The 
stance that he adopted recently has released certain 
uncertainties that I have nurtured for the past six months. We 
will never succeed in introducing a federalist Constitution in 
Italy. The North has been tainted by the South, which expects, 
and wants nothing more than, a welfare state. There is nothing 
to be done about it; that is the way the Italian people are, and 
that goes for me too. My friends in the League have not 
succeeded in doing anything to curb this tendency; they have 
merely been able to provide some kind of response to people's 
protests. 
  [Passalacqua] Was this all expected? Were you not the author 
of the Assago blueprint, which envisaged an Italy cut up into 
pieces? 
  [Miglio] The institutions of the First Republic were the 
only 
ones suited to the Italians who were comfortable in that state, 
and who remain so. 
  [Passalacqua] Which is why Bossi is turning toward 
regionalism... 
  [Miglio] Regionalism will not alter the situation much, 
because even if it is implemented, it will merely increase the 
influence of the welfare state... 
  [Passalacqua] So the federalism thrown out of the door will 
come back in through the window... 
  [Miglio] Yes, it is the only blueprint that enables Italy to 
be a respectable state. Now, however, I realize that I made a 
mistake, like inspector Rock on that television commercial many 
years ago. To have imagined a different order for Italy -- the 
federal order. The fact is that only a terrible economic and 
financial crisis could lead to federalism, but I really do not 
hope for such an end. 
  [Passalacqua] You seem embittered, professor. 
  [Miglio] A political scientist must tell the truth. I am a 
realist. 
  [Passalacqua] Does your realism now prompt you to say 
farewell to Parliament? 
  [Miglio] I am thinking about it, but this is not my foremost 
thought. I will stay on only if it is possible to change the 
system, but I am sure that there is nothing that can be done. 
  [Passalacqua] So are you totally pessimistic? 
  [Miglio] The system seems to me unchangeable. Despite all 
its defects and misdeeds. 
  [Passalacqua] Why? 
  [Miglio] From within, I can see the real nature of the 
Italian people who have always enjoyed excessive welfare 
benefits and are therefore unable to engage in a market economy. 
Do you know what I am going to tell you? We should not have 
signed the Maastricht Treaty, since we will be forced to violate 
them. 
  [Passalacqua] You are saying farewell to politics, and think 
that it is impossible to change anything. At the same time 
Bossi is seeking agreements with [Pact for Italy ideologue] 
Buttiglione, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Rooting for 
Italy leader] Berlusconi. It is legitimate to suspect that 
there is no complete concordance of views between you.... 
  [Miglio] Once again it is I who am imparting a profound 
significance to Bossi's options. If my analysis is correct, all 
this feverish activity on the part of the liberal democratic 
alignment is a waste of time. 
  [Passalacqua] Is it your realism that prompts you to bury 
the 
alignment for freedom even before it is born? 
  [Miglio] Indeed, the left-wing alignment will win. 
  [Passalacqua] Is there no hope? 
  [Miglio] Berlusconi and Segni are very likely to lose, short 
of a miracle. 
  [Passalacqua] Do you think the same about Berlusconi as 
[resigning IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli does? 
  [Miglio] Montanelli is a cynic; I am a skeptic. 
  [Passalacqua] But whom do you side with in the dispute 
between Montanelli and Berlusconi? 
  [Miglio] If I were a newspaper publisher, I would expect the 
editor to follow my general line. 
  [Passalacqua] Professor, how does the League regard the 
situation? 
  [Miglio] The League is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Before Assago you used to describe Bossi as a 
crazy bruiser. What about now? 
  [Miglio] He is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Many interpret your remarks as not very veiled 
criticisms of Bossi. 
  [Miglio] Utter nonsense. 
  [Passalacqua] Would you kindly give us your description of 
Bossi. 
  [Miglio] A great extemporizing leader with a great intuition 
with respect to political phenomena. 
  [Passalacqua] You said "extemporizing." For some time there 
has been increasing criticism of Bossi's oscillations. In LA 
REPUBBLICA yesterday, Giorgio Bocca said that if you fool around 
too much in politics you will suffer a pratfall.... 
  [Miglio] A large number of people vote for the League 
because 
that is the way Bossi is. 
  [Passalacqua] But the phenomenon of rejection does exist; it 
cannot be denied. 
  [Miglio] These things will undergo the acid test in the 
elections. I read Bocca's charges against Bossi: He said that 
we lack a strong program focus. He regrets the passing of 
localism. But, you see, when we were localists we were 
criticized. The League, remember, has always found a political 
identity in the electoral melting pot. Bossi thinks up the 
watchwords and points of policy at public rallies. So, my dear 
Bocca, have no fear. When the right moment comes, political 
identities will emerge. 
  [Passalacqua] Bocca said that the League is finished as a 
major political force. 
  [Miglio] Nonsense. Right now I do not think that the only 
option is to vote for the League. People know that we deserve 
their votes.
