   A jury has concluded that a defective
football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a
severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $11.2 million.
   The helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably
dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of Richard
Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County Circuit Court jury decided
Monday in an 11-1 vote.
   Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical
impairments and requires 24-hour care.
   It apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a
Bike helmet has been presented to a jury. Bike has been in the
helmet business since 1976.
   Mark R. Bocci, an attorney for Austria and his parents, John and
Perla Austria, said several other cases against Bike had been
settled out of court without disclosure of payments.
   Bocci and James M. Pippin, also representing the Austrias,
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had
not been adequately tested before the company marketed it.
   Bike and the Kendall Research Center, which tested helmets for
Bike, are both liable for damages. Both are subsidiaries of
Colgate-Palmolive Corp.
   Charles Peery, a Seattle lawyer for Bike, told jurors last week
that helmets similar to the one worn by Austria are used by 80
percent of the players in the Northwest and Alaska, from junior
high school teams to professionals.
   The Air Power model contains a bladder at the crown of the
helmet that is inflated with air. Other padding includes foam
strips, called sizers, that come in various sizes.
   Lawyers for the Austrias contended that the Air Power model for
large heads did not meet national testing standards, although
smaller helmets did pass the tests. They said detailed company
testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984.
   Peery argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a
subdural hematoma, bleeding in the brain caused by a blow, and
contended there was no proof that a football injury caused
Austria's hematoma.
   Peery said Austria had ignored advice from his physician not to
play football while he suffered headaches.
   Jurors concluded that Austria was 2 percent at fault, thus
reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for
daily care the rest of his life.
   William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, said
there was a strong chance of an appeal.
