   Italian voters dealt the new-look Communist Party a
sharp setback in regional and provincial elections, while groups
seeking greater local autonomy made surprising gains, according to
results released today.
   ``Earthquake at the polls,'' said the national daily La
Repubblica after the Lega Lombarda, a regional political party in
the Milan area, won 19 percent of the votes, outpolling the
Communists in the wealthy industrial region.
   Results from the voting Sunday and Monday confirmed the early
trends showing the Communists, who had come to the brink of power a
decade ago, getting no more than 24 percent of the vote.
   The Communists, Italy's No. 2 party, won 30 percent of the vote
in the last regional elections in 1985 and 27.8 percent in
parliamentary voting in 1987.
   The Christian Democrats, who have led or dominated all national
governments for four decades, suffered small losses and held on to
about a third of the total votes.
   The Socialists, Italy's No. 3 party, advanced, but with 15
percent of the vote were still a long way from overtaking the
Communists.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, warned during
the campaign that major shifts in the voting could cause his
coalition government to collapse. The coalition also includes the
Socialists and three tiny parties: Republicans, Social Democrats
and Liberals.
   But commentators said the results didn't appear to pose major
risks for the coalition.
   However, the results were a disappointment for the Communists,
who adopted a ``new course'' at an extraordinary congress in March
in an effort to halt the party's steady electoral decline since the
early 1980s and react to the democratic upheavals sweeping
Communist parties from power in Eastern Europe.
   At their congress, the Communists gave party leader Achille
Occhetto a mandate to restructure the party to try to unite Italy's
fractured left. This would eventually entail changing the party's
name and hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   The proposals were opposed by the party's old guard leaders, who
saw them as a denial of the party's history and roots.
   ``The new course didn't stop the hemorrhage of votes that has
gone on since 1984,'' said the leading Milan newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
   The biggest gains were made by the Lega Lombarda and similar
locally oriented groups in the north.
   These groups have been accused of prejudice toward Italians from
the south and immigrants from the Third World who have come to the
more prosperous north seeking work.
   But the Lega has denied the charge, saying its aim is to reduce
the power of the central government in local matters.
   ``The racist leagues advance,'' headlined Rome's Il Messaggero.
   But Giorgio Bocca, a La Repubblica columnist, said the
mainstream parties would be making a serious error to underplay the
reasons for the success of the new groups.
   ``This is the reaction to a policy which has led to the
bankruptcy of the public administration and handed large areas of
the south to the underworld,'' Bocca wrote.
   Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Lombarda, said its success in
becoming the second-largest party in Lombardy exceeded its
expectations.
   ``This is the first step toward our final goal of federalism, to
reduce the power of the central government.''
   Up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments, 87
provincial governing councils and 6,374 city governments. City
elections were not held in such major centers as Rome, Naples,
Trieste, Catania and Bolzano.
