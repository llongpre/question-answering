<CAPTION>  Photos (2); PHOTO: (2 Photos) Gary Parker -- Mercury News; As the biggest
names of the sport gather for their national championship in San Mateo,
there's little evidence of hype, scalpers or heavy betting. There's no problem
finding a seat, either -- especially if you bring your own, as did Louise
Grandi, right, of Memphis. The main action of bocce, a clay-court variant of
lawn bowling, is demonstrated above by Bimbo Gianchi of Chicago. The
tournament is free, and it continues through Saturday at Fiesta Gardens.
