They do these things wonderfully well in Copenhagen. The ballet matters a
great deal; dancers and choreographers are public figures - a postage stamp
bore the portrait of the great Danish ballerina Margrethe Schanne - and the
fortunes of the Royal Danish Ballet are of national concern.
Frank Andersen has directed the company for the past nine years - he will
retire this summer - and this year celebrates his silver jubilee as a member
of the Ballet. So, on Saturday night, there was a gala to mark his 25 years
of service, and an occasion to thank him for his achievement as director.
It was a splendid occasion, with that mixture of formality and happy ease
which is one of the joys of the Royal Theatre. Queen Margrethe was in the
Royal Box, a reminder of vital patronage - she has provided admirable design
for that most national of Bournonville's works, A Folk Tale - and the
audience knew it was there for a family celebration. There was nothing too
serious, some nice jokes, wonderful dancing, and a merry determination to
get everyone possible on stage somehow or other.
Thus the last act of the company's new Sleeping Beauty showed us roles being
shared, sometimes in mid-variation. There were two pairs of Bluebirds - with
Alexander Kolpin and Thomas Lund very buoyant - three Auroras and three
Princes, so that Yury Posokhov and Lloyd Riggins played catch-as-catch-can
in the Prince's solo and were tremendous.
It is one of the strengths of the Royal Danes that a career will start in
childhood - peering and cheering from the bridge in the last act of Napoli -
and continue well into autumnal years with rewarding character roles that
include Napoli's lemonade and macaroni sellers. So the children of the
ballet school came to salute Andersen (who is, officially, Royal Ballet
Master) and danced featly to the adorable rattle of the Polka Militaire,
which was composed for Bournonville in 1842.
Then we moved into the gala sweetmeats. There was new Danish choreography
with part of Anna Laerkesen's Whispers and Floating; John Neumeier's
Adagietto from Mahler 5 for Mette Ida Kirk and Yury Posokhov; Nina
Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca flashing through Don Quixote's flaming paper
hoops; Elisabeth Platel and Manuel Legris in Balanchine's delicate, allusive
response to Ravel's Sonatine - exquisite, subtle, both in ideas and
performance.
And of course, to finish with, came the crack of muskets, tambourines, and
the flash of Bournonville steps in the last act of Napoli. This is, because
of Bournonville's love of the theatre, his moral dignity, his belief in the
joyous nature of dancing, his power to capture the life of his time,
quintessentially Danish - not least in its response to southern light.
There were the ballet children on the bridge, and such eminent artists as
Niels Kehlet sitting at the cafe tables. There were the buoyant lines of
male dancers - young Johan Kobborg bounding through a solo like the spirit
of Bournonville - and the bewitching legion of the girls. And there, as the
hero, Gennaro, was Frank Andersen, still nifty as to step (he is, after all,
only 41 years old) and leading his entire company in these ever-fresh,
eternally sparkling ensembles.
We clapped and cheered. The children on the bridge waved and shouted. The
dancers cheered. Andersen, with the sincerity and charm that has marked his
dancing and his direction of the troupe, took his bows and the presents
brought on for him, and his laurels, saluted his monarch, and was rightly
moved near to tears. The applause went on for ever.
