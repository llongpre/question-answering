<TEXT>     After he came to America in 1955, he tried working for Central Concrete
Supply in San Jose, but his boss told him he needed to get into a business
that would take advantage of his built-in family workforce.;   So he tried
pumping gas, running a Mohawk station in Scotts Valley and later a Douglas
station in Santa Cruz.;   Still, there were his daughters. "That left us girls
out," said Maria Jorgensen, one of the seven. "Sure, I changed tires, but . .
.;   "So my dad looked at opening a business that could accommodate both sexes
equally.";   Food filled the bill.;   When Andrea "Papa Z" Zanotto died
Wednesday at a San Jose hospital at the age of 81, all of his children and
many of their spouses and children at one time or another had worked in the
family's two markets and one restaurant. More than 20 still do.;   "My father
tried to prove to his children that life is not meaningful without the desire
to work hard," said his daughter, Liz Caffrey.;   And Papa Z set the example.
First, he acquired the Thrifty Market at Hedding and Springer, but it burned
down, and was in the San Jose International Airport's flight path, so he
couldn't rebuild.;   Family members opened what they call Store No. 1,
Zanotto's Deluxe Market at Naglee and Bascom avenues in San Jose. Store No. 2
and Zanotto's Pasta and More restaurant in Scotts Valley and Store No. 3 in
Santa Cruz followed.;   Papa Z never took a vacation. He was always at the
store, Jorgensen said. He worked seven days a week.;   "It was his wont to go
in in the morning to make sure the store was clean and presentable," said
Caffrey's husband, Michael.;   Papa Z did take time to play a little bocce, as
a member of the Los Gatos Bocci Ball Association. And he belonged to the Holy
Spirit Catholic Church, the Italian Catholic Federation No. 919 and William
Paca Lodge of the Sons of Italy.;   But on June 27, when he suffered his
second, and eventually fatal, stroke, Papa Z was working at Store No. 1.;   It
clearly runs in the family: Papa Z's oldest son, Tony, who is athletic
director at Independence High School, also still works at Store No. 1.;   Papa
Z's wife of 54 years, Rosa, also still puts in four days a week in the San
Jose store's delicatessen.;   Why won't she quit? "What would she do with all
her spare time? she asks," Jorgensen said. "Mother's 74. She makes about 200
sandwiches a day."; Andrea Zanotto; (box)Born: March 2, 1910, Treviso, Italy.;
