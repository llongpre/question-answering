THE HISTORY of La Bayadere in the West is odd. It is one of Petipa's most
fascinating works, typical of his mature creativity - it dates from 1877 -
in its combination of exotic theme and spectacular effects, and testimony to
the vivid dramatic excuses he sought for his dance sequences. It has
survived in Petersburg despite revolution and ideological nit-picking. In
the West, while some of the old Mariinsky ballets percolated into the
repertory, no company could find the forces to mount such an undertaking.
It was during the first Kirov season in London in 1961, when the Shades
scene was part of a gala evening, that the importance of this choreographic
marvel was made clear. Nureyev's subsequent Shades staging for the Royal
Ballet was proof that the West might honourably emulate Russia. A BBCTV
transmission of the Kirov production in 1973 was significant; a decade later
Makarova revived the full-length ballet for American Ballet Theatre (and
very astutely reconstructed the last act that Leningrad had dropped 'for
lack of proper forces' after the Revolution.) This staging she was later to
mount for the Royal Ballet, and in Milan, Stockholm and Rio. Rudolf
Nureyev's last gift to the Paris Opera was a Bayadere which reproduced the
Kirov version. La Bayadere had become part of Western ballet's traditions.
But the Kirov could not tour it. One of the joys of seeing ballet in
Petersburg was the magnificence of the Bayadere scenery - dating from the
turn of the century, and too fragile to travel - as frame for Kirov classic
manner and mimetic dignity. Now the company has had the old scenery copied -
impeccably - and can show the West this ancestral treasure. It looked fine
on a first London outing on Thursday night. The Coliseum stage is somewhat
small for its grandiose scale, and the lighting was less than subtle, but
the painted sets are magnificent, and, making greatest sense of Petipa's
artifices, there are the Kirov artists.
The version is slightly edited - where was the Danse Manu, and some
variations in the Grand Pas? - but it is the authentic Bayadere, and demands
to be seen. La Bayadere is a ballet most serious in its dramatic
underpinning - sacred love in conflict with profane passion - and vastly
challenging for soloists and principals. The confrontation between Nikiya
and Gamzatti which ends the first act is as emotionally challenging as
anything in the old repertory. The division of dance interest - the
passionate Gamzatti given the bravura Grand Pas; the 'holy' Nikiya rewarded
with the Shades scene - reveals Petipa's astute sense of theatre. Solor is a
numbskull, but a tormented one, and the part rewards bold playing - as
Mukhamedov, Bocca and Manuel Legris have variously shown us. The technical
demands of the Grand Pas and the Shades sequence are among the greatest in
19th century ballet, and Petipa's dramatic skill can be seen in the
hallucinatory entry of the Shades as in the spacious exposition of
narrative. Minkus' score - given in the wise version preserved at the
Mariinsky - is no mean support for the drama, as the eloquent orchestral
playing proved.
But Bayadere demands potent central interpretations. Olga Chenchikova was
the Gamzatti of the this first performance, and opulently right. Her dancing
is magnificent in scale and assurance, commanding space in step and outline,
womanly rather than girlish - and how welcome for this fact. She provides a
physical force, a psychic intensity, that make the character fascinating in
temperament as in dance. Konstantin Zaklinsky was a Solor credible at every
moment, competent in his few dance passages, but notable for the stylistic
intelligence with which he illuminated conventional dramatics. We believed
in him.
I could not, though, believe in Yulia Makhalina as Nikiya. She is a
beautiful young woman, her silhouette long, sophisticated, her technique
forcefully brilliant. Alas, she plays Nikiya on the terms of her own
self-absorbtion. The role does not exist save as a display-piece for
extravagant prowess. The temple-dancer looks like a visiting star; the Shade
is concerned only with technical dazzle. Those spiritual qualities with
which Makarova and Asylmuratova have imbued the role - the dance as
declaration of holiest feeling, and gaining in luminosity thereby - are
foreign to Makhalina's reading. It is lit by technical fireworks rather than
the sacred fire of the first scene.
The three Shades soloists displayed Kirov classicism at its most satisfying.
I have already praised Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova this season.
Their companion, Irina Shapchits, is no less admirable. In the third
variation she produced ravishing dancing: exquisite in control, pure in form
as in manner. I have never seen the solo better done.
The Kirov season continues at the Coliseum until July 31
