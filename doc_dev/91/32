<F P=106> [Giorgio Bocca article: "Anticommunism Without Communists"] </F>
  [Text] Two temptations attributable to the fear of the new 
have become widespread in this confused election campaign -- 
anticommunism and Berlusconism. 
  Anticommunism without communism creates figments of the 
imagination which are completely without foundation but for that 
very reason irresistible. The RAI [state radio and television 
service] is dominated by the communists! How? Where? It is 
better not to ask, because it will make you look like either a 
communist or a gullible idiot. 
  No matter that the RAI's director is Gianni Locatelli, a 
Catholic, surrounded by professorial figures reminiscent of 
Bocconi or originating from Giuseppe de Rita's ultra-Catholic 
CENSIS [Social Investments Studies Center]. 
  No matter that two out of three television networks do not 
belong to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] area and that 
when it comes to radio, the Catholic, Aldo Grasso, is in charge 
of cultural programs and the liberal-socialist, Livio Zanetti, 
head of news. Never mind that: The RAI is dominated by 
communists. The proof? The RAI does not like [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi, who is leading a crusade against communism; 
"therefore" it is communist itself. "Is it not that the RAI is 
justifiably afraid that if Berlusconi is victorious he could 
gobble it up?" "Don't talk nonsense. It is communist." 
  The judiciary too are communists. This was said yesterday, 
to deafening applause, by red Titti [Judge Tiziana Parenti] -- 
apart from her hair, a few years ago she was also red by 
political affiliation. None of the magistrates involved in the 
corruption investigations -- Di Pietro, Colombo, Davigo, 
D'Ambrosio -- has ever been a communist party member, but if 
Titti Parenti says so, they definitely are communists. "But are 
they not trying almost obsessively to make Sama confess that 
Gardini paid the communists a billion lire?" "Yes, but it is 
all a sham." 
  The universities are communists, and so are the major 
newspapers. "But are their bosses not members of the haute 
bourgeoisie, major businessmen?" "Yes, but of the kind that 
flirt with communism in order to jointly trample honest 
anticommunist businessmen." 
  Anticommunism without communism is spreading like wildfire 
because it conceals a fear of the new -- which is indeed real, a 
constant factor in Italy's tradition of quick-change acts, in a 
country where, from Garibaldi to Mussolini, all destroyers of 
the old state resigned and promptly began to rebuild it. Not 
that we have confidence in the transformation of the progressive 
alliance; what has happened in France and Spain prompts caution, 
but be that as it may, a left-wing government must surely change 
a few details, must surely try to eliminate some bad habits, 
must surely correct some inefficiencies and instances of wastage 
-- enough to terrify the moderates who, if the ruling parties 
had not died of their own account, through a process of emptying 
and paralysis, would want them back again. 
  Berlusconism is the other side of the fear of the new; it is 
the old in a superficially new guise, and the moderates seek 
nothing more than superficial change. The League and the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] could not succeed on their own. For 
90 percent of Italians, the League is something alien and 
dangerous, parochial and secessionist. It may be only a paper 
tiger, but you never know what things will lead to -- look at 
what happened in Yugoslavia. Gianfranco Fini's MSI is less 
worrying, but still disreputable. The right man is Silvio 
Berlusconi, who represents the Italian people's two great loves 
-- soccer and television, the self-made man, from pauper to 
millionaire, but always easy to get along with. Who better than 
him could painlessly carry out the great and painless changeover 
of Italian politicians? Out with the old faces of the criminals 
and corrupt, and in with the unknown faces that are by that 
token new. 
  Silvio Berlusconi is said to have told journalists who asked 
him about his program: "I will not tell you; otherwise the 
others will copy it." Such a reply would sound ridiculous in a 
country that really wants to change, but it is a stroke of 
genius in a country that has no desire to change. A great and 
painless changeover of the political class: This is what the 
moderates expect from Berlusconi. The greedy service-sector 
bourgeoisie, with their carnation [Italian Socialist Party 
symbol] buttonholes, that used to applaud Bettino Craxi have 
been replaced by a second generation who applaud Berlusconi in 
the expectation of being able to further their careers and their 
own interests. 
  If the system of party rule was somehow similar to fascism, 
we must unfortunately admit that it collapsed without any 
anti-Fascists. At the Rome conference of Forza Italia, 
representing the same old Italy motivated by the principle of 
just getting along somehow, the audience applauded loudly -- and 
I would say with relief -- the vague hymns to economic 
liberalism, deregulation, and to God, country, family, and 
individuals that leave things as they are. 
  Both the moderates' anticommunism without communism and the 
vilification of Berlusconi, described as the "Black Knight" and 
founder of a Fascism clad in a cashmere sweater are both 
imaginary. What the moderates expect from Berlusconi in the 
event of victory is that he will recycle the democracy of the 
First Republic, complete with soccer and television.
