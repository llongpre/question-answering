<LEADPARA>  Accordion tunes and pasta aromas come to life for Sal Turturici, 72, when he
recalls his childhood Sunday afternoons in "Goose Town" basements.;   The time
was the 1920s and Goose Town was San Jose's Italian community, a neighborhood
that stretched from Willow to Alma streets.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Everyone from the neighborhood would meet in someone's basement and we'd
spend the day together," he said. "The mothers would make pots of pasta.
People would be playing the accordion and piano, although I never figured out
how they learned to play music.";   During those Sunday afternoons, Turturici
learned about Italian culture from parents and grandparents in the close-knit
community. Now he is passing along that knowledge, but on a larger scale than
basement conversations.;   Turturici has spent the past year planning the 15th
Annual Italian American Cultural Festival, which will be held this weekend at
the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. He has organized more than 200 volunteers
from the Italian American Heritage Foundation.;   The heritage foundation
sponsors the festival in cooperation with the city of San Jose and the fine
arts division. The festival attracts about 36,000 people.;   "I'm trying to
maintain our Italian culture of arts, music and folklore," Turturici said.
"Like me, I want people today to have memories about the Italian culture.";  
Festival visitors will see a replica of a festival in an Italian village.
About 30 food booths will offer authentic delicacies ranging from calamari to
linguine. Strolling musicians, bocce ball exhibits, arts and crafts booths, a
fashion show and a display of 40 Italian sports cars will be featured at the
festival.;   People can see continuous entertainment on three stages,
including opera workshops by San Jose State University, puppet shows and
performances by Italian folk dancing groups, singers and musicians. A
tarantella street-dance contest will start at 8 p.m. Saturday. An outdoor Mass
is planned for Sunday at 10 a.m.;   "We want to share our Italian culture with
all other ethnic groups in the Bay Area," said Tony Zerbo, heritage foundation
president. "We want to show people our rich culture.";   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
