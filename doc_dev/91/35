   The gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of
American Ballet Theater was such a success here in January that the
company decided to open its two-month season at the Metropolitan
Opera House by repeating it.
   There were a few differences Monday night; the evening was less
exciting but smoother running. As one ballet excerpt ended, the
next dancers entered. The audience could applaud but there was no
wasted time.
   This time, Alicia Alonso did not dance and Igor Youskevitch did
not make a speech. Two who danced Monday and did not in January
were Carla Fracci and Faruk Ruzimatov, formerly a Kirov Ballet
star, who has joined Ballet Theater.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov and Jerome Robbins, both praised during the
evening, did not attend either gala. Agnes de Mille gave a stirring
speech each time, though on Monday her body mike went on and off.
Company co-director Oliver Smith said 750 company members have
danced 385 ballets by 168 choreographers in the 50 years.
   Miss de Mille said, ``Lucia (Chase) said she wanted it to
include every kind of good ballet dancing and it did. People said
we had no style. That was our style.''
   She spoke after a lively excerpt from her ``Rodeo,'' with
Kathleen Moore as the Cowgirl and Victor Barbee as the Wrangler.
   Carla Fracci, an Italian ballerina much loved when she was a
guest artist with American Ballet Theater, danced the bride-to-be
in Antony Tudor's ``Lilac Garden.'' It was a poignant excerpt, with
Ricardo Bustamante as Her Lover, Michael Owen as The Man She Must
Marry and Martine Van Hamel as An Episode in His Past. Two other
Tudor excerpts were ``Pillar of Fire'' and ``The Leaves Are
Fading.''
   Ruzimatov provided excitement, danced a bravura solo from ``Le
Corsaire.'' Fernando Bujones also did bravura dancing, with Cheryl
Yeager in a ``Don Quixote'' excerpt and with Christine Dunham in a
Black Swan excerpt. Bjuones, an audience favorite when he was a
member of the company, has returned and was listed in the program
as a guest.
   Christine Dunham and Ross Stretton danced a White Swan duet.
Stretton will give his final performance May 22 and become
assistant to the company's directors. Johan Renvall also had a
flashy solo, the dance of the Bronze Idol from ``La Bayadere.''
Alessandra Ferri and Ricardo Bustamante did part of the hushed but
passionate balcony scene from Kenneth MacMillan's ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
   Dancer Kevin McKenzie made a speech saluting American Ballet
Theater's dancers through the years. At the end, a dozen company
alumni took bows with all the evening's dancers.
