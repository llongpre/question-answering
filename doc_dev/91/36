   Prospective jurors for the trial of reputed
organized crime members accused in a plot against a reputed Mafia
leader were asked how they view the Mafia and Italian-Americans as
jury selection began Monday.
   A pool of 90 potential jurors was called to U.S. District Court
for the case against six reputed members of the Genovese crime
family.
   The six are charged in a racketeering conspiracy that includes
controlling labor unions, extortion in the construction industry,
loansharking, illegal gambling, several murders and a conspiracy to
kill John Gotti, the reputed boss of the rival Gambino family, and
his brother, Gene.
   The trial is expected to provide a broad, detailed look at the
workings of a major organized crime family.
   The Gottis' names were listed among 100 people and businesses on
a questionnaire passed out to jury prospects, who were asked if they
were familiar with the names.
   Jury selection is expected to continue for the remainder of the
week.
   On trial are reputed Genovese ``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader,
Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59, of Jersey City; his alleged deputy,
restaurateur Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71, of Secaucus; Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, of Bayonne, termed an enforcer for the
group; Rocco J. Napoli, 42, of Secaucus; John Derrico, 27, of
Hoboken; and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, of Hoboken.
   All have pleaded innocent and deny involvement in organized crime.
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry ordered that the jury remain anonymous
because of the nature of the charges.
