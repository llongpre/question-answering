<LEADPARA>  IF there's ever to be "The Godfather, the Finale," composer Henry Brant seems
already to have set its atmosphere to music in magnificently doleful colors
for the San Jose Symphony.;    The nostalgia about the fading Italian
tradition in our world overflowed the Center for the Performing Arts on Friday
night with the world premiere of Brant's "The Old Italians Dying" for
orchestra and poem-narrator.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     San Francisco Beat Generation poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, 72, recited his
own poem, looking like one of the text's old Italians in felt hat on a park
bench -- a doomed species, awaiting extinction between games of bocce ball,
repeats of "Santa Lucia" and intermittent funeral bells marking the parting of
ways.;    The bells and balls, the tolling and the telling, the Chianti and
manicotti -- the poem to music conjured up the palpable atmosphere despite the
edginess of the gravel-voiced, crusty Ferlinghetti, making his symphonic
debut.;    Brant's music is multilevel, with the onstage strings providing the
wall-to-wall carpet of sound. Over this are laid a dozen or more quotations
from Verdi's "Aida," Rossini's "The Barber of Seville," Ponchielli's "The
Dance of the Hours," the folk song "Funiculi, Funicula," even a fascist hymn
from Mussolini's day.;    Brant astutely heaps these into interludes between
stanzas, assuring intelligibility of the text and of its many refrains and
images. Rather than prettify the music, he retrieves it as if heard from vague
sources -- from memory, from a scratchy record player, or maybe from a
staticky radio.;    After the 18-minute span, the effect was riveting,
buffeting in distortions, yet beautiful in the work's restraint.;    The six
mini-ensembles scattered about the balcony provide a counterpoint to the
orchestra as well as a competition, marching to its own independent conductor
(Brant).;    The impact of surround-sound never ceases to amaze in Brant's
music: His sonics embrace the listener, and on this night enkindled one of the
season's longest ovations.;    Unfortunately, compositions that quote to
excess breed instant recognition but rarely show much staying power after the
first performance or two. Nonetheless Brant's manner of bringing
expressiveness out of chaotic mismatches is undeniably imposing.;    No less
welcome was the immensely difficult Debussy "La Mer," where conductor George
Cleve enjoys a special advantage over other American conductors who merely
flounder about Debussy's ocean: Cleve is a link once removed from Debussy
himself. The link was his teacher, Pierre Monteux, whose career in Paris
overlapped Debussy's creative span.;    As a result, this was a superior "La
Mer" -- not without wrong notes, true, but thoroughly mysterious in its
unfathomable subtleties, and its nearly unidentifiable orchestral sounds.;   
The concert concluded with Dvorak's Symphony No. 7, a work as sparkling as the
mountain streams of Dvorak's native Bohemia. Dvorak vacillates between major
and minor keys with a facility second to none; he can also bring on rhythmic
shifts (as in his finale) associated with far bolder innovators.;    This is
Brant's third time around in San Jose with Cleve. The transplanted New Yorker
who moved to Santa Barbara in 1980 performed and was recorded with the
symphony (on the Sonic Arts label) in "Litany of Tides," with violinist Daniel
Kobialka.;    In addition, Brant's early opus "On the Nature of Things" was
played here five years ago.;    Besides having written 120 works in his long
career, Brant prides himself on writing for different instrumental
combinations in each new work, and on positioning his players at many
different places around the concert hall.;  San Jose Symphony; George Cleve,
