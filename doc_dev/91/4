  [Text] Let us turn to the Middle East. After having 
ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days 
following the latest round of massacres, the government in 
Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved 
in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime 
Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent 
Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own 
question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have 
restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho 
will be reached? 
  [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian 
translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO 
are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most 
difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The 
majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then 
in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip. 
  [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron. 
There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think 
about this? 
  [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to 
the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome, 
at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal 
living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence. 
This welcome extends to the Italian contingent. 
  [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian 
police force? 
  [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide 
security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be 
the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have 
their own security force. We are happy that the police force is 
on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end
