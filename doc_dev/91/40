Her extension seems to grow higher every year, but Alessandra Ferri is still a 
great Juliet where it counts -- in her intense surrender to each moment of 
Kenneth MacMillan's Shakespeare ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening in Shrine Auditorium, Ferri graced the last performance of the 
American Ballet Theatre season. Her Romeo: Ricardo Bustamante, a Ballet Theatre 
soloist with an unusually high extension of his own and an ability to almost 
match her sense of spontaneity and passionate involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Though his best dancing had extraordinary suavity and technical plush, 
Bustamante did not always look comfortable in his solos, with their emphasis on 
intricate combinations of jumps and turns in place. However, the duets were 
glorious: paradigms of mutual risk, trust and inspiration. Bustamante's 
sensitivity as an actor and strength as a partner released Ferri into dancing 
of thrilling urgency, intimacy, generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this final "Romeo and Juliet" featured a number of pointed character 
portrayals: Victor Barbee's brutal Tybalt, for example, and Clark Tippet's 
haughty Capulet, plus, as always, Georgina Parkinson's memorably elegant and 
neurotic Lady Capulet. 
</P>
<P>
John Summers made a confused, manipulated Paris (another victimized Verona 
youth rather than a co-conspirator). As Mercutio, Danilo Radojevic followed 
current Ballet Theatre practice by reducing the character to generalized 
sweetness and solid-gold virtuosity. Jack Everly conducted.LEWIS SEGAL
