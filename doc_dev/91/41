<DESCRIPT>  NEIGHBORHOOD; PARK; DRUG; ABUSE; CRIME; PROTEST; SAN-JOSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  An aroused downtown San Jose neighborhood, fearful of crime near its park,
held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night and demanded more city spending and
police patrols to snuff increasing problems with gangs and drugs.;   The
protest foretold dilemmas the city council will face early next year when it
tackles a $20.6 million budget shortfall in a second straight year of terrible
fiscal news. Though city services may be cut, parks and police remain potent
political touchstones throughout San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  S.J. NEIGHBORS MARCH TO PROTEST GANGS, DRUGS IN
PARK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Joined by Councilman David Pandori, more than 100 people bundled up in the
night air to walk a solemn square around Backesto Park. They started at North
13th and Jackson streets, holding tapered candles and walking to the martial
beat of a tenor drum.;   "I played here as a child; my daughter played here as
a child; and now the kids can't even play," said one marcher, Marlene Perez,
40, who lives on North 16th Street.;   The 10 1/2-acre park, one of 143 in San
Jose, is the focal point of a working-class neighborhood on San Jose's North
Side, traditionally ethnic Italian but recently turning Hispanic and Southeast
Asian.;   It is known for its lighted softball diamond, its singular orange
tent covering bocce ball courts, and the folksy neighborhood eateries at two
of its corners, Rollo's Donut &amp; Coffee Shop and Emma's Taqueria.;   People in
the neighborhood suspect that crime has grown in and around Backesto since
Roosevelt Park, a few blocks southeast, became a targeted Project Crackdown
area in March.;   Project Crackdown is a city program to clean up
neighborhoods and stop illegal drug sales.;   At an evening meeting in Holy
Cross Church, organized by People Acting in Community Together, people talked
about thugs gathering in the park at night, wearing what appear to be gang
colors. Merchants were said to be harassed by vandals. "Drug houses" were said
to proliferate in the area.  </TEXT>
