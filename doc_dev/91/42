<F P=106> [Commentary by Giorgio Bocca: "Berlusconi Thanks His </F>
Enemies...."] 
  [Text] In all competitions the winner wins partly thanks to 
his own merits and partly also thanks to his adversary's 
weaknesses. And these weaknesses are partly the result of 
ignorance and presumption and partly the result of a history 
that has taken place and that it has been impossible to 
eliminate overnight. This is what has happened in the two 
recent elections, one confirming the other. What were the 
weaknesses and mistakes of the Left, for which Achille Occhetto 
is now paying? The first, I would say, was the inability of 
first the PCI [Italian Communist Party], then the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] to co-opt the moderates. It is 
not true that the Italian Left is numerically weaker than the 
Left in other European countries: It commands 30 percent, like 
the socialist parties in France, Britain, Spain, and Germany -- 
except that they find allies, whereas it does not. 
  The fault for this inability to co-opt does not of course 
lie 
solely with Occhetto and the rest of the leadership, which 
succeeded in making the abjuration that the Communist Parties of 
France, Spain, and Portugal never made. But this time it failed 
to overcome the imprinting of Third International-style 
communism, of the single and different party which could lead to 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
  This was seen extremely clearly at the 25 April and 1 May 
rallies. The party leadership wanted two great demonstrations 
of unified progressives; it wanted to bind the values of the 
resistance and labor to the democratic front that opposed the 
new Right, but the comrades in Reggio Emilia or Grosseto did not 
see it exactly that way: They came to Milan and Turin with 
their banners and flags to show Italy that the old Communist 
Party was still the strongest and different. And the moment 
Bossi and the League supporters joined the rallies they booed 
them loudly. 
  Their second mistake, or sad destiny, was to have taken 
insufficient account of the country's modernization -- and I am 
not talking about an ideal kind of modernization, but simply 
keeping pace with the times. There was a failure to realize 
that the crisis of the system of party domination was indeed the 
crisis of corrupt parties, but also of the party as such and of 
all large organizations of delegated responsibility; that 
monothematic class definitions had come to an end and that 
archipelagoes of different interests had emerged in their place. 
In other words, that although the workers existed, they were no 
longer visible as a class; that the trade unions existed, but no 
longer represented all the workers. 
  I think that this was easy to understand and that the PDS 
leaders did so; the difficult thing was to draw the necessary 
conclusions, to abandon the customary routine, the fiction that 
the old automatic relations between party, trade unions, and 
class still operated. 
  The third mistake was the hysteria common to the entire 
progressive front. The rejection of the election result, the 
belief that insults, scandal-mongering, and total negation were 
enough, if not to reverse the situation, then at least to freeze 
it. That was a mistake, and the European elections have 
confirmed the fact. 
  But Forza Italia won partly also thanks to the errors and 
weaknesses of the League and of its leader, Umberto Bossi. We 
knew he was not very British in his approach, but his inability 
to accept defeat displays very bad manners. He has been 
described as "that crazy uncle from Brianza" with reference to 
the rather eccentric, cantankerous, but nevertheless rather 
likable kind of uncle that you find living in the provinces. 
But what Bossi has been displaying for some time is not so much 
fierce polemics or eccentricity, as mental confusion. Somebody 
should explain to him -- though I fear it would be in vain -- 
that his contortions and inconsistencies achieve the result of 
earning Forza Italia more votes, as we have seen in the European 
elections. 
  Bossi thinks he is smart -- super-smart, in fact, someone 
who 
can deceive everyone by saying something and then retracting it. 
And he thought that the general elections, with the horse 
trading over the first-past-the-post system, were the ultimate 
proof of his cunning. He reasoned exactly like [former Italian 
Socialist Party Secretary] Bettino Craxi who, with his 11 
percent of the votes, wanted 30 percent of the seats. The 
Italian people would not agree to it, and if he thinks he can 
reverse the situation by shouting that Berlusconi is a 
mercenary, that he will deprive him of all his television 
channels, that the League is the only anti-dictatorial 
democratic force, which, however, instead of abandoning the 
dictatorship that is being formed, remains within it in order to 
resist it -- he is making a big mistake. 
  It is all nonsense, and nothing more so than the observation 
that "the Italian people failed to understand." But the Italian 
people, by penalizing him and the League's inconsistencies, 
simply followed their desire for stability, and if the new 
government's critical mass is Forza Italia, if the force which 
attracts votes by virtue of its sheer weight is Forza Italia, 
this is the very reason why they voted for it. The fact that 
this center-right option displeased the progressive forces and 
that some of them considered it repugnant, no less, is another 
matter, but you cannot expect those who granted the center-right 
a mandate for change in the general elections to perform a 
turnabout themselves within the space of a few weeks. 
  We hope that our fellow citizens will accept Achille 
Occhetto's resignation -- painful, we imagine -- in a civilized 
manner and that they do not attribute the Left's defeat to his 
moustache or other personal attributes. He showed great courage 
in carrying out the change of course, and now it is no tragedy 
to hand over the reins. With all the shady characters and 
scoundrels that have appeared on the political scene, it really 
would not be appropriate to crucify him....
