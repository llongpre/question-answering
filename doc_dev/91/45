<P>
As result of injury and substitution, the pair of star-cross'd lovers 
originally announced for the American Ballet Theatre performance of "Romeo and 
Juliet" on Thursday danced one day early at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marianna Tcherkassky made a lyric, sweet Juliet who revealed unexpected 
dramatic depths and strengths in the later scenes. John Gardner, in his first 
casting as Romeo, drew only the outline of a dramatic character but proved a 
secure and considerate partner. 
</P>
<P>
While never a dancer who relied upon technique to dazzle, Tcherkassky 
compensated with purity of line and sincerity of emotion. For her, love at 
first sight meant a deeply felt pain that later turned impetuous and wild. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite that intensity, Gardner portrayed a genial, warm but self-effacing 
Romeo. He has yet to inhabit the role. He danced with careful, underpowered 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Boggs provided a wry, bemused Mercutio, pre-eminent among his friends in 
clear shape, vigor and non-stop momentum, and wrenching in his death scene. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross Yearsley was only a sketchy, untidy Benvolio. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown made Tybalt the bully of Verona and, like a textbook bully, reacted 
with fear when he actually committed an act of violence -- in this case, 
killing Mercutio by accident. The moment relieved an otherwise oppressive 
single-note interpretation but passed all too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Dunham ventured an intriguing, atypical Rosaline, a woman who seemed 
not altogether indifferent toward Romeo. If only he hadn't caught sight of that 
other woman at the ball? 
</P>
<P>
In two cases, casting became almost prodigal: the authoritative Martine van 
Hamel as a determined and sympathetic Lady Capulet, and the virtuosic, airborne 
Johan Renvall ennobling the cameo solo duties in the Mandolin Dance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Everly again conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Ballet Theatre continues through Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $40. 
Information: (714) 556-2787.
