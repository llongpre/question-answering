In a departure from its past emphasis on ballet, the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center will for the first time present a modern dance troupe, Center 
officials said Monday in announcing their 1990-91 dance season. 
</P>
<P>
The Martha Graham Dance Company of New York will make its only Southern 
California appearances Jan. 4-6, 1991, at the Center. The Graham company 
programs will be offered in addition to a subscription package of three ballet 
companies that includes the previously reported engagements of the Australian 
Ballet Aug. 7-12; and the New York City Ballet, Sept. 25-30, 1990, in its first 
return engagement at the Center since 1986. Rounding out the season will be the 
fifth appearance at to the Center by the American Ballet Theatre, March 12-24, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Graham dates represent an experiment for the Center, and they will be 
offered as an option for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We will find out what interest there is for modern dance" in Orange County, 
Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. "If the Graham experience is 
good, I think there are certain other companies that we might be able to 
handle" as options for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from the list is the Joffrey Ballet, which has been part of 
the Center's ballet series three times over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the very beginning that we are not committed to any one 
company on an annual basis," Kendrick said. "Our goal is to provide a range of 
companies over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the decision not to bring the Joffrey next season was "absolutely 
not" related to the collapse of negotiations between ABT and the Los Angeles 
Music Center Operating Company in December, something that ABT Executive 
Director Jane Hermann attributed to the Joffrey's residency at the Music 
Center. (Officials at the Music Center, however, denied Hermann's charge.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have had (the Joffrey) several times and anticipate having them again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham will be represented by two programs of mixed repertory: One will include 
her classic "Appalachian Spring," set to Copland's score, and the other, her 
"Errand Into the Maze." 
</P>
<P>
For its exclusive West Coast engagement, the New York Ballet will lean heavily 
upon repertory by founding artistic director George Balanchine. "La Source," 
"Stars and Stripes," "Four Temperaments" and the infrequently toured "Vienna 
Waltzes" will be among the works danced. 
</P>
<P>
The run by American Ballet Theatre will be split between mixed repertory (to be 
announced) and either Natalia Makarova's staging of "La Bayadere" or a new 
production of "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the Australian Ballet will dance "Giselle," Lichine's 
"Graduation Ball," Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" and others to be announced by 
Australian and New Zealand choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for subscription tickets will range from $57 to $190; they will include 
four events -- one each by the Australian and New York City ballets, and two 
performances by ABT. Tickets for the Graham programs will be offered as an 
option for subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Subscription tickets will go on sale May 20. Tickets for individual programs 
will go on sale about six weeks before each engagement. Information is 
available at (714) 556-2787.
