<LEADPARA>  IT WAS a pleasant way to spend an afternoon for Lester Briggs. Tuesday boasted
a sky of early summer blue, a couple of blue jays were hovering among the
green pines. Briggs had 14,400 square feet of green grass in front of him. A
sign outside the gate: "Palo Alto Lawn Bowls Club.";    Briggs has been lawn
bowling for almost 4 1/2 years now. At first, he didn't think much of the
game. "I got introduced by a neighbor," the 74-year-old Palo Alto man said. "I
resisted for a long time."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Briggs would rather swing a few at the golf course. The thought of rolling
a bowl down a patch of grass didn't strike his fancy -- at first.;    The
object of the game is to get more of your bowls nearer to a little white ball
(called the jack) than your opponent. Sounds pretty easy, except that the
bowls are not round. They're flatter on one side, so the bias makes the bowl
curve one way, a source of much frustration.;    "It almost wrecks my golf
game," Briggs said.;    It's an intricate, mental game, said Harry Press, who
along with his wife, Martha, joined the club three years ago. "Like any game,
it has its moment of joy, its moment of horror," Press said. "If you're a
golfer, you understand that.";    The game might have come from Egypt about
7,000 years ago. But one cannot separate lawn bowling from the British. The
sport is quite popular in Australia, India, New Zealand, Hong Kong -- places
where the Union Jack once cast its shadow. George Washington was an avid lawn
bowler. He reportedly stopped though, when folks deemed it was too British for
the colonials.;    BRIGGS DOESN'T mind that it's a British game. He's one of
the better players in the Palo Alto club, which boasts 125 members ranging
from 28 to 86 years old.;    He didn't mind showing me how to play the game. I
tiptoed on the lawn, as gingerly as a teen-ager creeping home after curfew, so
I wouldn't damage the grass. Briggs said the club doesn't like to have young
kids there. "They'd want to play touch football or something," he said. I
surveyed the lawn -- it would be a killer place to practice your putting.;   
"You want to roll the bowl off of your fingers," he said. I tried. I missed
the mark by a couple of ZIP codes. I tried a few more times. Briggs is a very
patient man. He would have to be, because I was not very good. It was futility
in the afternoon.;    "This Palo Alto green, in my opinion, is the finest
green in California," Briggs had said earlier. So I couldn't blame the course.
I exited the club and Briggs went back to his friends.;    There were many
more games to play.;    The Palo Alto Lawn Bowls Club opens its door 1 to 3
p.m. Saturday. Coaches will be there to show you how it's done. Just wear
soft-soled shoes. The green is at the corner of Cowper Street and Churchill
Avenue. Call (415) 323-2575.;    For those of you interested in watching the
Italian form of lawn bowling, there are U.S. Bocce championships today through
Saturday at Fiesta Garden in San Mateo. Opening ceremonies are at 8:30 a.m.
and the games run till about 5 p.m. each day. It's free.  </TEXT>
