   Federal prosecutors were preparing to tell a
bloody tale of restaurant rubouts, a ``contract'' to assassinate
reputed mob boss John Gotti and Mafia control of construction as the
trial of six alleged organized crime figures opened today.
   Jury selection began today, and opening arguments were scheduled
to start next week. U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry granted
the government's request for an anonymous jury _ a first for a
federal trial in New Jersey _ because of the nature of the case.
   The trial is expected to shed light on organized crime violence
in the New York metropolitan area, and may help solve a string of
mob-related murders dating back 12 years.
   It also will mark the courtroom debut of Vincent ``Fish'' Cafaro
as a prosecution witness.
   Cafaro is a former associate of jailed and aging former Genovese
boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno. He testified last year before
Congress about life in the mob and its activities.
   Ms. Barry said the case ``makes no pretense of being other than
an organized crime case in which the inner workings of the Mafia
will be hammered home.''
   The main defendants, indicted in June, are reputed Genovese
``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader, Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59; his
deputy, restaurant owner Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71; and Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, termed an enforcer for the group. The three
are being held without bail.
   They and the other defendants _ Rocco J. Napoli, 42, John
Derrico, 27, and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, _ are charged with
racketeering.
   The racketeering charge includes allegations of controlling labor
unions, extorting construction industry figures, trafficking in
stolen goods, loan sharking, illegal gambling, murder and murder
conspiracy. All deny the charges and organized crime ties.
   Much of the government's case rests on 2,500 hours of taped
conversations recorded in a back room of a Hoboken restaurant from
June 1987 to March 1988.
   Prosecutors said they will present evidence about a plot to kill
Gotti, the flamboyant reputed boss of the Gambino crime family in
New York City. Authorities have said the Genovese family was angry
about Gambino incursions in northern New Jersey territory.
