<TEXT>     Brant unveils tonight the world premiere of his "The Old Italians Dying,"
with the legendary San Francisco poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, 72, reading his
own free-verse poem.;    Brant is stationing his musicians at seven sites
around the concert hall for this reminiscence of the Italian immigrants of the
past.;    Space is the new dimension of our century, Brant points out. "But
the musicians have forgotten all about space, even though composers were
working on it since the Renaissance." Brant himself uses space boldly and
unconventionally. A piccolo may be in an organ loft, a tuba poised in a
stairway, and 80 trombones scattered around a cathedral.;    Among his 120
works, those since 1950 have musicians spread around the hall in many
configurations, which are specified in a chart bound into the score. His
scores provocatively specify, "Do not attempt to perform this with all your
forces on stage." At age 78, Brant remains one of the leading innovators of
the field, changing his instrumentation in every new work he tackles -- and
even incorporating elements such as jazz bands and Caribbean combos into
symphonic pieces.;    Anything goes -- but always according to a methodical
plan.;    "In spatial music, I have no real competitors," he observes. "I
guess it's because I add new problems: I use larger forces, produce great
complications in rehearsal, use unusual parts of the hall, and entail extra
expense. And usually, negotiations with a fire marshal are needed to approve
it.";    Brant's San Jose project began when Conductor George Cleve, a great
admirer of Ferlinghetti, met with the poet, then got the symphony to approve
commissioning the score to incorporate the readings.;    Wearing a faded felt
hat like the Italians of the North Beach poem, Ferlinghetti will make his
symphonic debut tonight at the Center for the Performing Arts.;    While Cleve
conducts the main orchestra on stage, Brant will lead the subordinate forces
located about the balcony.;    The 14-minute piece will develop metaphors from
the poem, such as the sound of Washington Square's church bells. There are
also more than a dozen quotes from familiar Italian music, including "Santa
Lucia," "La donna e mobile," excerpts from "Aida," the Anvil Chorus and the
Caruso standard, "Vesti la giubba." Each of the two orchestras has its own
meter, "at times on collision courses," Brant says.;    The development of
spatial music used to be widely credited to Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose
"Gruppen" came out in 1958. But Brant's "Antiphony I" predated that by five
years. The (unperformed) instructions for Darius Milhaud's "L'homme et son
desir" and Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4 came a whole generation earlier. And
the composers of the 17th century routinely wrote for antiphonal choirs at
Venice's San Marco Cathedral, in an early version of live stereo.;    Brant,
the foremost living exponent of Ives' spatial innovations, never met Ives,
much to his regret. But he recalls attending a 1931 New York City new-music
concert of music by himself, Ruggles and Ives in which one listener got in a
shouting match with unresponsive patrons about him.;    The listener was
apparently composer Ives himself, railing against closed minds. He allegedly
thundered: "This is strong music! Stand up and take it like a man!";    Too
bad Ives can't be there this weekend to hear Brant, Ferlinghetti and Cleve
enkindle the touching texts on the old Italians "sitting there / Waiting for
the bocci ball to stop rolling / Waiting for the bell to stop tolling &amp;
tolling / For the slow bell . . . telling the unfinished 'Paradiso' story.";  
 This premiere will be followed by Debussy's "La mer" and Dvorak's Seventh
Symphony, which was substituted after the 1990 death of scheduled cello
soloist Paul Tortelier.; San Jose Symphony; George Cleve, conductor; Where,

Boulevard at Park Avenue, San Jose; 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Flint Center, De Anza
