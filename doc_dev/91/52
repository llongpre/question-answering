   A federal jury today convicted five men of
forming a Mafia faction that shot to death a mob-linked businessman
in a restaurant and plotted to kill John Gotti, reputed boss of a
rival crime family.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. called the defendants ``among
the most powerful organized crime figures in the state'' and said
the verdict was a ``tremendous blow to organized crime in New
Jersey.''
   The five could receive at least 50 years in prison at sentencing
Aug. 3.
   Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, a reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader,
of the Genovese crime family, was convicted of conspiracy,
racketeering, planning to kill Gotti and arranging the murder of
businessman Irwin Schiff.
   Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino family, was a target because
of a turf battle, authorities said. The FBI tipped Gotti to the
plot, which was not carried out.
   The 350-pound, free-spending Schiff was shot to death in 1987
over dessert at a restaurant on New York City's Upper East Side.
   His dinner companion, identified in news reports then only as a
``mysterious blonde'' who fled the scene, was revealed in court as
Judy Galip. She testified that a masked man fired two shots into
Schiff's head.
   Prosecutors said Schiff may have threatened to expose Genovese
activity or could no longer be trusted with a $25 million to $40
million mob money-laundering operation.
   Also convicted were Martin A. ``Motts'' Casella, Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, union official Rocco J. Napoli and former
Hoboken police Lt. Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello.
   Daniello was convicted in the conspiracy to kill Gotti. The
government said DeSciscio was the lookout at the Schiff slaying.
Casella, who owned a restaurant allegedly used as the organization's
headquarters, was allegedly Manna's chief lieutenant and Napoli a
member of the criminal enterprise.
   Key evidence in the 3{-month trial was a series of conversations
secretly tape-recorded at Casella's restaurant and a coffee shop in
Jersey City.
   The defense attacked the tapes as inaudible and said the
government misinterpreted the conversations and misattributed
voices. They provided jurors with alternate transcripts and said any
talk of killing Gotti was a joke.
