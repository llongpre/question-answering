   The convictions of three of New Jersey's most
powerful mafia members in a plot to kill reputed New York godfather
John Gotti and his brother are a major setback for the mob,
prosecutors said.
   ``We have a hope of making organized crime a historic relic
rather than something that preys on people in the community year in
and year out,'' assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said Monday.
   A federal jury Monday convicted Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna of
Jersey City, the reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader of the
Genovese crime family; restaurateur Martin ``Motts'' Casella; and
enforcer Richard ``Bocci'' DeSciscio of plotting to kill Gotti, the
flamboyant reputed boss of the rival Gambino family, and his brother
Gene.
   They also were found guilty of arranging the 1987 New York
restaurant murder of Irwin Schiff, a 350-pound, mob-linked
businessman.
   Also convicted of racketeering conspiracy were the group's arms
supplier, former Hoboken police Lt. Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello and
laborer's union official Rocco J. Napoli. John Derrico, 27, of
Hoboken, a cook at Casella's restaurant, was acquitted on all counts
but a gambling charge.
   The jury returned the verdict on the morning of its fifth day of
deliberations after a 3{-month trial.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the convictions were
particularly damaging because the Genovese family dominated Mafia
activity in northern New Jersey.
   ``Any organization that can plot to kill John and Gene Gotti from
the rival Gambino crime family is obviously a very powerful force,''
said Alito. Manna's faction has operated since the 1950s with
``virtual impunity,'' he said.
   The FBI tipped Gotti to the plot. He was targeted in a power
struggle, authorities said.
   The government has said Schiff may have been killed because he
threatened to expose Genovese activity or because he could no longer
be trusted with a $25 million-$40 million mob money-laundering
operation.
   The defendants barely reacted to the verdict announcements.
DeSciscio blinked and looked away as his wife Ellen sobbed.
   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry ordered that all the
defendants except Derrico be held until sentencing.
   Manna, Casella and DeSciscio face up to 65 years in prison,
Napoli 75 or more, Daniello 40 and Derrico five.
   David Ruhnke, DeSciscio's attorney, said the verdict left him
``extremely disappointed.''
   ``I can understand the jury believing people were involved in
gambling,'' Ruhnke said. ``It's very difficult to believe my client
was involved in murder.''
