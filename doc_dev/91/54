<LEADPARA>  An aroused downtown San Jose neighborhood, fearful of crime near its park,
held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night and demanded more city spending and
police patrols to snuff increasing problems with gangs and drugs.;   The
protest foretold dilemmas the city council will face early next year when it
tackles a $20.6 million budget shortfall in a second straight year of terrible
fiscal news. Though city services may be cut, parks and police remain potent
political touchstones throughout San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

S.J. NEIGHBORS PROTEST PARK'S DANGERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Joined by Councilman David Pandori, more than 100 people bundled up in the
night air to walk a solemn square around Backesto Park. They started at North
13th and Jackson streets, holding tapered candles, and walking to the martial
beat of a tenor drum.;   "I played here as a child, my daughter played here as
a child, and now the kids can't even play," said one marcher, Marlene Perez,
40, who lives on North 16th Street.;   The 10 1/2-acre park, one of 143 in San
Jose, is the focal point of a working-class neighborhood on San Jose's North
Side, traditionally ethnic Italian but recently turning Hispanic and Southeast
Asian.;   It is known for its lighted softball diamond, its singular orange
tent covering bocce ball courts, and the folksy neighborhood eateries at two
of its corners, Rollo's Donut &amp; Coffee Shop and Emma's Taqueria.;   People in
the neighborhood suspect that crime has grown in and around Backesto since
Roosevelt Park, a few blocks southeast, became a targeted Project Crackdown
area in March.;   Project Crackdown is a city program to clean up
neighborhoods and stop illegal drug sales.;   At an evening meeting in Holy
Cross Church, organized by People Acting in Community Together, people talked
about thugs gathering in the park at night, wearing what appear to be gang
colors. Merchants were said to be harassed by vandals. "Drug houses" were said
to proliferate in the area.;   The Rev. Chuck La Verde, a charismatic Catholic
priest, told Pandori and Police Chief Lou Cobarruviaz: "Remember the Alamo.
Remember Pearl Harbor, they were saying last week. Remember Backesto Park.";  
Crime statistics are inconclusive. From March 16 to Sept. 15, according to one
police report, seven incidents were reported in Backesto, resulting in four
arrests and one citation. During the same period in 1990, 11 incidents were
reported, resulting in one arrest and six citations. And conversations with
police who know the area suggest that crime has not moved from Roosevelt to
Backesto.;   But city parks official Nancy Johnson sympathized with people's
fears. "Perception is reality," she said in an interview. "If they perceive
something is changed, that is their reality.";   And Pandori, in an interview,
said that the neighborhood is right to be vigilant. "Project Crackdown is more
a result of failure than success," the first-term councilman said. "The idea
on the North Side is not to let things deteriorate. It's a legitimate point.";
  To that end, Pandori is proposing a police call box near the park, more
lighting, graffiti cleanup, more police and park rangers, and a police
community advisory group.;   Many of these proposals are small-ticket items.
But it remains to be seen how many new cops and rangers San Jose can afford.  </TEXT>
