The Spanish cape, that classic swirl of mystery and elegance, is making a 
modest comeback on the frosty streets of Madrid this winter as a cloak of many 
guises. 
</P>
<P>
The king of Spain has a cape, and so do a growing number of Eurocrats in 
Brussels. Picasso and Hemingway wore Spanish capes; Marcello Mastroianni and 
Catherine Deneuve still do. Capes are still rare in the swank precincts of 
Paris or Rome, but the sight of a caped Madrileno on an evening prowl is more 
arresting than unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the cape is returning to fashion as an implicit assertion of 
nationality at the same time as it is flaring across national borders on a 
continent where Spain treads with a new step. 
</P>
<P>
These twin currents say as much about changing times in Europe today as they do 
about clothing styles. Spain, like Europe, is going two ways -- inward and 
outward -- at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Last, Some Movement 
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards are lately come to the councils -- and the spirit -- of Europe 
after four decades of isolation under Gen. Francisco Franco. Only in recent 
years have they joined the European Community and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, the landmark economic and security alliances that link West 
European democracies in unprecedented prosperity and unity. 
</P>
<P>
Historically more preoccupied with Latin America and North Africa than with 
Continental affairs, Spain now accepts its membership in Europe with a blend of 
exhilaration and trepidation. "Europe is one nation. Learn languages," urges a 
language school's advertisements on downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Spaniards measure their own achievements against the rest of Europe. 
Reporting that Europe is revising its traditional view of Spain's cultural 
level, the newsmagazine Cambio 16 recently noted with satisfaction, "After 
overcoming its isolation, present-day Spanish culture is awakening respect and 
great curiosity." 
</P>
<P>
Curiosity extends in all directions today in a prosperous West Europe where 
consumer goods routinely vault falling frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
The French, Spaniards and Italians have little interest in each others' wines, 
thank you, but they all understand that state-of-the-art whiskey and rain gear 
come from Britain. Italians are also lately come to British teas, while the 
British usually prefer anybody else's wine to their own. French roads are full 
of Italian Fiats; Italian TV airs slick ads for West German Volkswagens and 
French Renaults. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a trend toward European homogenization, home-grown national customs thrive 
nonetheless. West Germany is currently up in arms over a European Community 
decision to allow the import of foreign beers and sausages. Italy is appalled 
by Common Market regulations that permit the sale in Italy of the soft, gooey 
kind of pasta that Americans are weaned on but Italians won't eat. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Europe's national cults don't travel well -- village bocce, big-time 
bullfighting and high-tone fox hunting, to name a few. Others do. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the cape. Its origins are lost in time: a hybrid descendant of the Roman 
toga and the humble shepherd's blanket, perhaps. Its signature, though, is 
emphatically Spanish. The 3,000-member Friends of the Cape here says religious 
pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela in the 6th Century wore capes not very 
different in style from those made today. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th Century, Spain's national chief of police tried to ban capes 
because they made it too easy to hide a weapon. The 19th Century, in contrast, 
is remembered by aficionados as the golden age of the cape. Yet even in the 
early days of this century, Spaniards -- urban and rural, of all social 
classes, men and women alike -- wore capes as shelter against rain and cold. 
Then began a long decline, until the cape survived principally as a set piece 
among soldiers, clerics, bullfighters and a hard core of purists for whom there 
is no substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the cape is yesterday, today and tomorrow," said Alfonso Sanchez, the 
86-year-old president of Amigos de la Capa. "I have never known an overcoat. My 
memories are wrapped in my cape. I love its embrace -- almost feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Classically, a Spanish cape is cut in a full circle of tightly woven virgin 
wool from the mountain town of Bejar; the only variation in size is the length. 
A cape should end about three inches below the knees, according to Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
The man's cape, adorned at the collar with the hammered silver emblem of 
Salamanca, is usually black or navy blue with a short, stiff collar and inside 
front panels of red or burgundy velvet. The splash of color may be hidden or 
displayed, but the cape is never fastened. Women's capes, cut from a 
half-circle of the same wool, vary in style from year to year and may include a 
hood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Upswing 
</P>
<P>
Cape sales rise and fall according to fashion, but lately they have shown a 
strong upswing, according to Marison Nieto at Sesena, the shop in old Madrid -- 
the only one left -- that has been the arbiter of Spanish capes for nearly a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our new clients are Europeans who were exposed to capes for the first 
time by seeing Spaniards wear them at Brussels and other centers of the 
European movement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the cape swirls out across the Pyrenees to a European audience, so, too, is 
it finding new favor among Spanish nationalists. Most of Madrid's habitual 
capistas are aging dons of law or the arts who, by custom, don their capes from 
November -- when the courts open -- until the almond trees blossom in early 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's cape heritage runs deep, though, and it is felt even among the overcoat 
crowd: a Spanish man is as likely to throw his overcoat, in cape fashion, over 
his shoulder as he is to put it on. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, there are also some unabashed new friends of the cape, and many of 
them are young Spaniards intrigued by a garment that is at once a piece of 
history and a distinctive national symbol in a Europe increasingly full of blue 
jeans. Both Sesena and the Amigos de la Capa are pleased by what they say is a 
marked increase in young Spanish capistas. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the other day, I had a call from some young people in La Coruna who want 
to become (members of) Friends of the Cape," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
The cape is also developing some improbable new friends among the 58 million 
international tourists who come to Spain each year. For a few, it has become 
only a memory of Iberia. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have gotten into a guide book somewhere, because suddenly the Japanese 
are turning up in large numbers. They are very quick to buy capes," Nieto said.
