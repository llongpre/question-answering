   Three Mafia figures convicted in the rubout
of a 350-pound mob-linked businessman and a plot to kill John
Gotti, reputed boss of the rival Gambino crime family, drew at
least 75 years in prison each.
   The sentences imposed Tuesday ``removed some very dangerous and
evil organized crime figures from the public,'' said Michael
Chertoff, first assistant U.S. attorney.
   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry sentenced Louis A.
``Bobby'' Manna and Martin ``Motts'' Casella to 80 years in prison
and Richard ``Bocci'' DeSciscio to 75 years. They were convicted in
June of racketeering.
   The government said Manna, 60, of Jersey City was the Genovese
crime family's consigliere, or No. 3 leader. Casella, 72, of
Hoboken, was described as Manna's chief lieutenant in running New
Jersey rackets. DeSciscio, 47, of Bayonne, was called a hitman for
the family.
   They must serve about 60 years before becoming eligible for
parole.
   The judge said the evidence ``fairly shrieked of the defendants'
guilt.''
   ``I can't say I've seen anybody more implacable and more
relentless as a professional criminal than Mr. Manna,'' said
Chertoff, who also prosecuted the 1986 Commission case in New York
that led to 100-year prison terms for the Mafia top bosses. ``In
the face of this awesome criminality, you almost lose the capacity
to speak.''
   Manna, in his usual elegant dark suit, stared straight ahead,
his head high. He instructed defense attorney Raymond A. Brown only
to repeat assertions of innocence.
   Also sentenced were Rocco J. Napoli, 43, of Secaucus, a Laborers
union official, who received a term of six years and three months,
and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 68, a former Hoboken police
lieutenant, who got four years.
   Manna was also fined $250,000, and Casella and Napoli were fined
$25,000 each.
   All the defendants were found guilty of racketeering conspiracy,
and all but Daniello were convicted of racketeering and illegal
gambling.
   All but Napoli were convicted in the Gotti plot; Manna, Casella
and DeSciscio were convicted in the slaying of the mob-linked
businessman, Irwin Schiff. Napoli was convicted of illegal labor
payoffs.
   The trial included tapes of Manna, Casella and DeSciscio
discussing a plot to kill Gotti and his brother in what authorities
said was a power struggle between the nation's most powerful Mafia
families.
   The FBI warned the Gottis, and no attempt on their lives was
reported.
   Schiff was shot in 1987 in a New York restaurant. The government
said he may have been killed because he threatened to expose
Genovese activity or could no longer be trusted with a more than
$25 million money-laundering operation.
