   An aging Communist has reopened one of the darkest
chapters of Italy's postwar history, charging that his party was
behind a three-year reign of terror in a region dubbed the
``triangle of death.''
   The Communist, Otello Montanari, has accused his party of
covering up its members' role in the hundreds of killings that
plagued north-central Italy for years after dictator Benito
Mussolini was killed.
   He also revealed that the Communist Party helped the killers
flee to Czechoslovakia.
   In response to his charges, the Communist Party has finally
admitted it bore some responsibility for the rash of slayings in
the so-called ``triangle of death.''
   The disclosures by Montanari, 65, have shocked many Italians and
led to a re-evaluation of the anti-Fascist Resistance, one of the
country's most revered ideals.
   The debate has also widened a split in the West's largest
Communist Party, already reeling from the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Forty-five years have gone by. It's time to attentively judge
these affairs. It is necessary for democracy, for the Resistance,''
Montanari said in an Aug. 28 letter to a Bologna newspaper that
sparked the debate.
   The triangle of death was part of the ``red zone'' of northern
Italy. Even today, it is dominated by the Communist Party, the
country's second-biggest party.
   When Mussolini was killed in April 1945, Communists and other
Resistance fighters went on a two-month orgy of revenge. At least
12,000 people, most suspected of supporting fascism, were slain
before a new government restored order.
   But in the triangle of death - bounded by the cities of Modena,
Reggio Emilia and Bologna - the killings continued for another
three years. Hundreds more people were slain, including former
Fascist officials, factory managers, landowners and Roman Catholic
priests.
   Montanari, a former partisan and party leader in Reggio Emilia,
charged some Communist officials in the area had ``an attitude of
tolerance, of covering-up and even of close cooperation'' with the
killers.
   ``Whoever knows about it, must speak,'' he appealed.
   His call has led to an outpouring of new details in national
newspapers and on television from Communists and relatives of
victims, some breaking decades of silence.
   Their accounts, as well as newly publicized academic research,
indicate Communist ex-partisans carried out many of the killings.
   They depict a Communist Party leadership that publicly blamed
ex-Fascists for the murders, but secretly helped scores of those
responsible to escape to Yugoslavia and then Czechoslovakia, which
had come under Communist rule.
   ``It has been the end of a myth,'' said Ennio Dinolfo, a
professor at the University of Florence who has written a book
about Italian history from 1943-53. ``The party did its best to
keep this hidden.''
   The disclosures have sometimes been painful for a country that
often seems to gloss over its Fascist past while enshrining the
Resistance.
   ``It was Italy's one claim to respectability'' after the war,
noted Oxford University historian Denis Mack Smith, a specialist on
Italy.
   The new accusations have particularly angered the older,
hard-line members of the Communist Party. Many took part in the
Resistance, which included a large number of Communists and other
parties.
   ``To repudiate the Resistance means to destroy the principal
pillar on which the civil co-existence of the postwar period is
built,'' said five party officials, all former partisans, in a
statement.
   Two thousand people gathered in Reggio Emilia on Sept. 8 for a
silent march to protest a hastily called congress by neo-Fascists
to re-examine the killings in the triangle of death.
   ``Hands off the Resistance,'' read one of their signs.
   The Communists emphasize that their postwar leader, Palmiro
Togliatti, condemned the violence in the triangle of death.
   But the young reformers who now dominate the Italian Communist
Party, or PCI, have called for ``glasnost'' and a re-examination of
the period.
   ``The initiative of Otello Montanari ... brings to light the
responsibility of the PCI and of its leadership, and we must
reflect on this,'' said Piero Fassino, the party's director of
organization.
   Part of the controversy about the killings is why the
information has only emerged now, more than a decade after scholars
began discovering it.
   Some observers say the younger Communists are trying to use the
disclosures to discredit their older rivals, who oppose efforts to
reform the party and drop the Communist name.
   Others say the information has emerged because the Communists
fear Czechoslovakia's new democratic government might have made
some of it public soon.
   Giorgio Bocca, a newspaper columnist and author of several books
on postwar Italy, said the scandal is tied to the decline of the
Communist Party in recent years.
   ``When the PCI was strong, everybody shut up, even the
middle-class newspapers,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   He and others say that the dominant Christian Democrat party
worked closely with the opposition Communists in the past, and
didn't want to embarrass them.
