<LEADPARA>  'COPPELIA" is cute, and American Ballet Theater's "Coppelia," as with
everything that bears the ABT stamp, is big and cute -- a baby elephant with a
pink ruffle and toe shoes.;    Oh, well. It's nice to see this charming
meringue of a ballet done so stylishly, though ABT probably spent six times
what San Jose Cleveland Ballet did for its "Coppelia" to achieve precisely the
same result.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And speaking of SJCB, what a surprise to discover that the first act of its
and ABT's "Coppelia" are practically photocopies. Though billed as new, ABT's
is really the 1968 production staged by former ballet master Enrique Martinez.
It apparently made an indelible impression on SJCB's director, Dennis Nahat,
who danced in it.;    Both, of course, are based on Arthur Saint-Leon's 1870
original, which avoids all the dark sides of E.T.A. Hoffmann's story. Dr.
Coppelius, the toy-maker, is a Svengali in the story; in the ballet, a
harmless eccentric.;    On opening night Thursday, Cheryl Yeager and Julio
Bocca were the lovers, Swanilda and Franz, who quarrel over Franz's
infatuation with the life-size mechanical doll, Coppelia. (They'll repeat the
roles tonight.) Their sparky exchanges, jubilant delivery and youthful romance
are a delight to watch.;    Other standouts in this cast were Kathleen Moore
and Roger van Fleteren, who led the harvesters' mazurka with panache, and the
slow-burning, luxurious Christine Dunham as the allegorical "Prayer" in the
wedding divertissement.;    There will be multiple casts over the weekend,
including some to stretch your willing suspension of disbelief -- such as the
tall and mature Cynthia Gregory, who dances Sunday evening with Jeremy Collins
as Franz. In that performance, Michael Smuin, former director of San Francisco
Ballet, will chase the bats from Dr. Coppelius' belfry.;    This storybook
"Coppelia" has a surprisingly stodgy set by Tony Straiges, who would have
seemed to be a natural for fairy tales after designing "Into the Woods." Here
he converts an Alpine village to a colorized version of the industrial city of
Frankfurt.;    Patricia Zipprodt's costumes, however, are beautiful excursions
into peasant territory. Jack Everly led the orchestra, which was barely
passable in the first act but respectable in the other two.;     American
Ballet Theater; 'Coppelia'; When: 2 and 8 p.m. today-Sunday; Where: War
Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco; Tickets: $15-$65.
