<TEXT>     Located in a 1767 tavern at 2 Unity Alley, a small cobblestone byway,
Million is one of a handful in America with membership in the prestigious
Relais et Chateaux et Gourmand. George Washington dined here in 1791.;   
Louis's Charleston Grill (chef Louis Osteen prepared a small dinner for Prince
Charles and friends last year) is located in Charleston Place, a mall off the
lobby of the grand Omni Hotel.;    We especially liked Poogan's Porch, a new
Italian restaurant called Bocci's and the atmospheric Garibaldi's, which
specializes in off-the-menu seafood.;    (check) WHERE TO SHOP -- King Street
is a narrow one-way corridor packed with fine shopping establishments for
antiques and other wares. Ben Silver specializes in distinctive blazer buttons
-- more than 900 designs -- but also has ties, blazers and other clothing for
men and women. Fine imported silver, china, furniture and other antiques are
found at Geo. C. Birlant &amp; Co., which also makes the Charleston Battery
Bench.;    At 105 Broad St. (corner of King Street) are the salesrooms for
Historic Charleston Foundation Reproductions, where authorized copies or
adaptations of Charleston treasures -- silver, porcelain, brass, fabrics,
wallpaper, needlework and furniture -- are displayed. The foundation's Museum
Shop at 108 Meeting St. has a gift shop and bookstore.;    (check) WHAT TO SEE
-- Among the museums worth visiting are the American Military Museum, 40
Pinckney St.; Charleston Museum, 360 Meeting St., founded in 1773 and the
oldest museum in the United States; and the Citadel Museum, on the campus of
the Military College of South Carolina.;    Historic homes abound including
the Nathaniel Russell House, 51 Meeting St., which is a National Historic
Landmark and property of Historic Charleston Foundation. The Federal-style
structure was completed in 1808 and features a wonderful three-story
free-standing staircase.;    Also worth seeing: the Edmondston-Alston House,
21 E. Battery, which looks across Charleston Harbor; the Aiken-Rhett House, 48
Elizabeth St., built in 1817 and enlarged in Greek Revival style in 1833-87
while serving as the home of Gov. William Aiken; and the ornate,
24,000-square-feet Calhoun Mansion, 16 Meeting St.;    The city's wealth of
historic churches are highlighted by St. Michael's Episcopal, completed in
1761 and the oldest in the city. Except for brief periods, its bells have rung
out over Charleston for more than 200 years. George Washington worshiped here
in 1791.;    Visitors shouldn't miss the stately grandeur of several outlying
plantations. Three -- Magnolia, Middleton and Drayton Hall -- lie along the
Ashley River northwest of the city; Boone Hall Plantation is to the north. All
are open the year-round.;    Drayton Hall, oldest and considered the finest
Georgian Palladian plantation home in the United States was built from 1738 to
1742. It is the only Ashley River plantation that survived the Civil War
intact. Magnolia Plantation and Gardens was established in the 1680s. It
claims to be America's oldest major garden with 500 acres of lawns, gardens,
marshes and trails.;    Middleton Place Plantation, where America's first
landscaped gardens were laid out, was recently restored from hurricane damage.
Boone Hall Plantation has been a working plantation since 1681, first for
rice, later for cotton and now for pecans. The original 1750 mansion fell into
ruin and was replaced by the present Georgian structure in 1935.;    (check)
