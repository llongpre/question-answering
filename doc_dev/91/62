<LEADPARA>  As this city continues to reel economically from the one-two punch of an
earthquake followed by a recession, business in one of its best-known
districts is booming.;   North Beach, a neighborhood built by Italian
immigrants and made world-famous by beatnik poets, is in the midst of a
revival and a return to its roots.  </LEADPARA>

BUSINESS IS BOOMING IN FAMED S.F. DISTRICT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     New Italian restaurants and coffee shops have opened in long-vacant
storefronts along Columbus, and some of the raunchy sex shows and porno shops
along Broadway's "Silicone Gulch" are giving way to more wholesome businesses.
Even the landmark Condor Club, where Carol Doda ushered in the topless craze
in 1964, has closed, reopening last month as a respectable bistro.;  
Everywhere there are smells of garlic and fresh-ground coffee. And the happy
jingle of cash registers abounds. Despite the general economic slump, Marsha
Garland, executive director of the North Beach Chamber of Commerce, said a
survey last month found business in North Beach the best in 20 years.;  
'Almost a miracle'; "Something happened here that's almost a miracle," she
said.;   Garland, an unabashed booster and amateur historian of North Beach,
says the revival is based on promotion of the community's ethnic heritage. So
eager are local businesses to emphasize the Italian connection that they have
won approval from the city to change the name of the street that runs through
the heart of North Beach from Columbus -- which some might regard as
sufficiently Italian already -- to Corso C. Colombo.;   About 90 percent of
the restaurants, bars, shops and other businesses in North Beach are
distinctively and authentically Italian. But neighboring Chinatown is
expanding, and leaders in Chinatown say the resurgent ethnic pride in North
Beach has a down side: increased racial tension as more and more
Chinese-Americans move into what had been Italian neighborhoods.;   Resentment
noted; "There's a strong undercurrent of resentment that's bound to explode if
effort is not made to manage the problem," said Edward Liu, general counsel
for the Chinatown Merchants' Association. "The city is becoming Balkanized;
the traditional harmony between the Italian and Chinese communities is
breaking down.";   Actually, little of an Italian community is left in North
Beach. Several old-timers estimate no more than 10 percent of current North
Beach residents are of Italian descent. Most left the neighborhood in the two
decades following World War II, they say, lured away by jobs and the promise
of what seemed like big real estate profits.;   When they sold their homes and
businesses, it often was to residents of Chinatown, which, as one of the
nation's most densely populated communities, is bursting its seams. Now, by
Garland's estimates, Chinese-Americans own 75 percent of the property in North
Beach and represent 60 percent of its population.;   "It's a natural
evolution," Liu said. "The Asian population is growing and Chinatown is not
adequate enough to hold all the businesses.";   Italians chose to move;   Liu
said that should not cause resentment within the Italian community,
considering that it was Italians who freely chose to sell their properties,
often so they could move down to the Peninsula or up to Marin County.;   Most
longtime Italian residents don't like to discuss the matter with outsiders, at
least not for attribution. Most, such as Mario and Guido, two elderly men who
can be found many afternoons at the local bocce ball court, seem to believe
that North Beach as they have known it is doomed.;   "It's not North Beach
now; it's Chinatown," said Guido, who declined to give his last name.;   "You
know why?" he asked, leaning his weathered face closer, as if to divulge a
secret. "It's because Italians are stupid. They thought they were getting big
money for their property. They sold six-unit flats for $24,000 after the war.
Now they're worth a million and a half.";   He shrugged. "You watch. In 10
years, none of these Italian businesses will be left.";   Colorful lore of
North Beach; If the Italian businesses do die off, it will mark the end of a
rich chapter in San Francisco history. North Beach, which was long known as
Little City because the Italian immigrants who lived there were cut off from
the rest of the city by Chinatown and the rough-and-tumble Barbary Coast
waterfront district, is the site of some of San Francisco's oldest buildings
and most colorful lore.;   The Saloon, for example, a funky bar in the 1200
block of Grant Avenue, has been slaking thirsts since 1861. Local historians
say it survived the great fires following the 1906 earthquake because
volunteer firefighters abandoned other buildings to save it. Not only did it
have a porcelain urine trough that ran the full length of the long bar, but,
above the bar, it also had their favorite bordello.;   Even more threatened
than Italian culture is the bohemian culture that made North Beach
world-famous in the 1950s as the haunt of Beat Generation writers Jack
Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder. Some of the few remaining pillars of
bohemia -- if it dare be said that bohemian culture has pillars -- complain
that the local color that made North Beach famous has been all but destroyed
by rising food and rent prices.;   Bohemians priced out; "North Beach has been
priced out of existence," says novelist Herbert Gold. "The days of young
writers hitting town and immediately heading for North Beach are over. The
rents are not right, the restaurants are not right and the places to hang out
aren't there.";   Nonetheless, Gold notes, there still are cafes like the
Trieste and bars like Tosca that serve as oases for local writers and
painters. And it is in North Beach, on the Russian Hill side, where Gold
chooses to live.;   North Beach also is home to poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
whose City Lights Bookstore, founded 38 years ago on Columbus just south of
Broadway, remains a beacon of hip sensibility.;   "It's a community in the
European sense of neighborhood," says Ferlinghetti. "There's life on the
streets at night. I can't imagine living anywhere else in San Francisco."  </TEXT>
