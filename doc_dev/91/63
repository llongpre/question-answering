<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Chamber of Deputies floor </F>
leader Roberto Maroni by Gianni Pennacchi in Rome; date not 
given: "`OK, I Am Running for Prime Minister'"] 
  [Text] He fires no fusillades, preferring the soft chords 
of the electronic keyboard to deafening bursts of fire, but the 
music is still the same: He and Bossi are reading from the same 
score, and you would have considerable difficulty in finding 
dissonances. Malicious tongues insinuate that, in reality, the 
floor leader is merely slick at adapting to circumstances, 
always acknowledging the supremacy of the leader, but actually 
each has his own part to play: One strikes and the other 
soothes. One thing is certain, however: Roberto Maroni can 
soften even the League's harshest messages. 
  Thus, while he provides musical interludes, at the keyboard, 
of course, during the election rallies, Bossi's candidate for 
prime minister confirms his bid: Palazzo Chigi, the bone of 
contention between the League and Forza Italia, will go to 
whoever obtains the most votes, implicitly, therefore, to 
Maroni. Martinazzoli? Nothing doing, there will be no governing 
with "the old"; and Spadolini can forget it too, he and his 
"institutional" governments. Fini? Sorry, he is still beyond 
the Leaguist pale; at the most he could give outside backing to 
a minority "freedom alignment" government. But then, why should 
the competition between Bossi and Berlusconi come as such a 
surprise? Mao would call it "contradictions among the people," 
there is perfect unison on the manifesto, nothing like the 
cacophony to be heard from the Left. 
  [Pennacchi] What are you up to, Maroni? While Bossi totes 
his musket about, you play the piano? 
  [Maroni] It is just two different ways of giving our 
opponents an earful. He fires fusillades, and I use the 
keyboard. 
  [Pennacchi] It is official then, you are the League's 
candidate for prime minister, designated to Palazzo Chigi by 
Bossi? 
  [Maroni] OK, let us say so. But I am not losing sleep over 
it, in fact it has put me in a good mood. 
  [Pennacchi] Does it not create problems for you with 
Berlusconi? You yourself acted as the League's ambassador to 
Forza Italia. 
  [Maroni] And why should it create problems for me? At the 
end of the day, what it will all boil down to is who wins the 
election. Everyone can pick the candidate they want, but we 
cannot say now what will emerge from the vote. So proposing a 
name for prime minister just means flying a flag until the 
accounts are balanced after 29 March. 
  [Pennacchi] So what is all this about the war of the prime 
ministers, this affirmation of Leaguist pride? 
  [Maroni] Whatever Giorgio Bocca [journalist] may say, the 
League has people equal to any ministerial appointment. So if 
the prime minister's job is to head a government team, we have 
proved that we have more than one person capable of doing it. 
  [Pennacchi] Nevertheless, a handicap from which the 
progressive alignment suffers now seems to be afflicting the 
freedom alignment as well: You, too, are not so united, with 
Bossi hurling daggers at Berlusconi, firing point-blank on Fini. 
  [Maroni] Fini does not form part of the freedom alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] True, but he is one of the opponents of the 
Left. 
  [Maroni] Martinazzoli opposes the Left too, but he is an 
opponent of ours as well. The freedom alignment does not 
currently comprise the National Alliance. Nor does Fini seem to 
me to be using kid gloves against us; the fact that he is 
running against us in all the constituencies in the north shows 
that he is outside the freedom alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] And why is Bossi taking potshots at Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] Bossi is stressing something that is a fact: In 
this freedom alignment, there is one political body, the League, 
that has made a decisive contribution to the defeat of the old 
system, and there is another component, Forza Italia, that 
emerged a month ago. This is the difference underlying the 
League's claim to the political leadership of the alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] Which nevertheless generates conflict, like on 
the Left. 
  [Maroni] There is conflict, but it does not concern the 
manifesto and matters of substance like it does on the Left, 
with Bertinotti saying treasury bonds should be taxed and 
Occhetto saying they should not, Bertinotti advocating 
withdrawal from NATO and Occhetto going off to meet its 
secretary-general. This means they have no joint program, 
whereas we have, a federalist, liberal program. Our 
disagreements do not touch on the things to be done. There are 
four of us in the alignment, and we are running separately in 
the proportional vote, because there are a few differences, but 
they are not programmatic, nor are they as deep-rooted as they 
are on the Left. 
  [Pennacchi] To put it simply, what do you quarrel over? 
  [Maroni] We quarrel over who is the 100-percent expression 
of 
what is new, and who expresses the new tendencies, though 
without being completely new, as is the case with Forza Italia. 
  [Pennacchi] By the way, has the Leaguist people's rebellion 
against the candidates imposed from above and regarded with 
disfavor been quelled? 
  [Maroni] It was not a rebellion, just a strong protest by 
those who found they had to accept not so much the Forza Italia 
candidates, but some from the CCD [Democratic Christian Center], 
in other words former Christian Democrats. I understand and 
appreciate their reaction, but it is the price we have to pay 
for the political deal. And I'm telling League militants that 
this operation will allow the League to win the election and 
enter the government. We must look beyond the boundaries of our 
own constituencies and swallow the bitter pill. 
  [Pennacchi] To hear Bossi speak, the impression is that you 
are more willing to govern with Martinazzoli than with Fini. 
  [Maroni] No, Martinazzoli never. He represents the old. 
Fini represents the extremely old, although the fact that he 
has never governed militates in his favor. But one thing is 
clear: We have chosen our allies first, and there is no chance 
of a deal with the others; they are all our opponents. 
  [Pennacchi] And what if you win the election but cannot 
achieve an absolute majority without Fini? 
  [Maroni] Our experience over the last year leads me to 
believe that even a minority government that seeks a separate 
majority to vote each individual measure is possible. And if it 
were not possible, we would certainly not do deals with the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] or the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left]. 
  [Pennacchi] So you say no to Spadolini's proposals? 
  [Maroni] In the face of the unstoppable advance of the new, 
Spadolini and all the other old blusterers from the old regime 
should have the humility to keep their mouths shut. If we had 
to take lessons from Spadolini and Scalfaro, the trainbearers to 
all the Christian Democrat governments, in how the new Italy 
should be governed, we should have no chance. The electorate 
will tell us what we have to do on 27 and 28 March. Spadolini 
should just thank his lucky stars that he is a senator for life.
