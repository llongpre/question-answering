Four world premieres, a new, full-length "Sleeping Beauty," and the U.S. 
premiere of a work by the late Kirov choreographer, Leonid Jakobson, are 
highlights of the 1990 spring season of San Francisco Ballet, recently 
announced by Helgi Tomasson, artistic director of the Bay City troupe. This 
57th consecutive subscription season by the company opens Jan. 27 and ends May 
6; performances are again scheduled in War Memorial Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson's new "Sleeping Beauty" production, to be designed by Jens-Jacob 
Worsaae, who collaborated with Tomasson on the company's 1987 "Swan Lake," will 
be unveiled March 13. Brand-new works in the season will be choreographed by 
Lisa de Ribere, Brenda Way, David Bintley and Val Caniparoli, the ballet's 
resident dance maker. Jakobson's "Rodin," being seen in this country for the 
first time, will be danced at performances beginning April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed on the eight repertory programs: Balanchine's "Serenade," 
Tomasson's "Menuetto" and "Variations de Ballet," the collaboration (1960) of 
Balanchine and Lew Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Announced at the same time is San Francisco Ballet's first engagement at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, Oct. 17-22, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Joffrey's '89-'90 season is due to be announced Monday. Stay 
tuned.

BRUHN PRIZE: Announced just five days before the final competition, the 
decision of American Ballet Theatre not to send dancers to the just-concluded 
International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize in Toronto, seemed to 
discombobulate the annual contest, which draws its talent from only four 
companies: ABT, National Ballet of Canada, Royal Ballet, and Royal Danish 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with only six (instead of eight) finalists in contention, the 
judges chose Silja Wendrup-Schandorff of the Royal Danish Ballet and Stephen 
Legate of the National Ballet of Canada for the top prizes: $6,000 to each 
dancer, plus a statuette. 
</P>
<P>
Wendrup-Schandorff, 20, performed the pas de deux from Balanchine's "Agon" and 
a new work, "Hommage a Bournonville," with Henning Albrechtsen of the Royal 
Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Legate danced the pas de deux from Marius Petipa's "Le Corsaire" and the second 
movement of Glen Tetley's "Sphinx" with Jennifer Fournier, another National 
Ballet dancer. 
</P>
<P>
The other competitors were Belinda Hatley and Sergiu Pobereznic of Britain's 
Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The week before the competition, Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of ABT, 
sent word that "there are no suitable candidates in the designated age category 
(18-23) that are currently available to compete." Robert Pontarelli, speaking 
for ABT last week, told The Times he felt that statement needed no elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
About ABT's nonparticipation in the 1989 competition, Celia Franca, founder of 
National Ballet of Canada, which hosts the contest, said: "We sincerely hope 
they will join us in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The late Erik Bruhn left funds to establish the prize in a codicil to his will. 
He specified the competitors be a male and female dancer between the ages of 18 
and 23 and come from four companies with which he was closely associated -- the 
National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet and American 
Ballet Theatre. Bruhn was artistic director of National Ballet of Canada for 
the three years before his death in 1986.

CORRECTION: Contrary to information published in this space last Sunday, the 
two operas to be performed by the touring Alexander Spendarian State Opera of 
Armenia at the Wiltern Theatre five times this week will not be receiving U.S. 
premieres. Armen Tigranian's "Anoush" has previously been produced in Southern 
California, as well as around the nation. About Dikran Tchoukhadjian's "Arshak 
II," records are inconclusive -- but chances are it has been performed on the 
West Coast. What is incontrovertible is that the troupe's recent productions of 
these works are new to our eyes. More information: (213) 465-6168.
