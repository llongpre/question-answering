   Mikhail Baryshnikov's new staging of ``Swan
Lake'' will be danced on opening night of the American Ballet
Theater's Metropolitan Opera House season, he said Thursday in
announcing the company's May 8 to July 1 programs.
   The season includes New York premieres of three works
choreographed by Twyla Tharp, ``The Bum's Rush,'' to music by Dick
Hyman, ``Everlast,'' to music by Jerome Kern, and ``Quartet,'' to
music by Terry Riley, and company premieres of two more dances by
Tharp, ``The Fugue'' and ``In the Upper Room.''
   Audiences in the Met also will see New York premieres of ``The
Garden of Villandry,'' to Schubert music, by Martha Clarke, Robert
Barnett and Felix Blaska, and of dancer Clark Tippet's ``Rigaudon,''
to Benjamin Britten music, and ``Some Assembly Required,'' to
William Bolcom music. Miss Clarke, who creates performance pieces,
is making her Ballet Theater debut.
   ``Swan Lake,'' with choreography by Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa
and additional choreography by Baryshnikov, was first danced in
Costa Mesa, Calif., in December. Other evening-length ballets
scheduled for the Met engagement are ``Don Quixote,'' ``Romeo and
Juliet'' and ``La Sylphide.''
   Philip Morris Companies Inc. is the sponsor of American Ballet
Theater's 50th anniversary celebration and tour this year.
