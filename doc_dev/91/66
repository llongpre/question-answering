   The FBI warned John Gotti, reputedly
the nation's most powerful mobster, he were being hunted by Mafia
hit men, officials said in announcing the indictments of 22 people
in the restaurant rubout of a businessman.
   Federal indictments unsealed Tuesday offer a glimpse into
feuding between the Genovese and Gambino crime families.
Authorities say the indictments could cripple the New Jersey
faction of the Genovese group.
   The indictments name 22 people, including reputed Genovese
figures, construction company executives and union officials.
   Authorities had no specific information about a link between the
plot to kill Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino family, and the
slaying of New York businessman Irwin Schiff, said Newark FBI chief
John C. McGinley.
   After Schiff was gunned down Aug. 8 over dessert at a New York
City restaurant, law enforcement officials said they believed he
had ties to the Gambino family and was killed in a dispute over
money.
   Federal authorities said Schiff was involved in up to $40
million in fraudulent loans and was the target of a criminal
investigation. Seven people have been arrested in connection with
his financial dealings.
   At a news conference to announce the indictments, state police
Superintendent Col. Clinton L. Pagano said the New Jersey Genovese
faction was fighting efforts by Gambino operatives to move into
northern New Jersey and therefore allegedly plotted to
``eliminate'' John Gotti and his brother, Gene, a reputed
high-ranking member of the Gambino family.
   In bugged conversations last year at a Hoboken restaurant, Louis
A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59, of Jersey City, alleged head of the New
Jersey Genovese faction, and his lieutenants discussed killing the
Gottis, McGinley said.
   Also at the restaurant were Genovese associates Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, of Bayonne and restaurant-owner Martin
``Motts'' Casella, 71, of Secaucus, the indictment said.
   The FBI warned the Gottis of the plot last fall, and they
decided ``to use their own devices to protect themselves,''
McGinley said.
   The larger indictment contained the Gotti and Schiff charges, a
labor payoff scheme, loan-sharking and a ``large-scale horse and
sports-betting operation,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   A second indictment alleged that seven defendants carried out
another illegal gambling business.
   Authorities refused to discuss the details of the Gotti and
Schiff allegations.
   In raids early Tuesday, 130 state and federal law officers
searched homes and businesses in New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania and arrested 21 of the suspects, McGinley said.
   On defendant was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and
was not immediately arrested, McGinley said.
   An attorney for Manna, Joseph Castiglia, said his client
``categorically denies the allegations.'' But Castiglia said he
would not comment further until he could read the indictment more
closely.
   DeSciscio, a close associate of John DiGilio, a reputed Genovese
soldier slain last month, was especially ``entrusted with carrying
out violent assignments for the (Genovese) enterprise,'' the
indictment said.
   DeSciscio's attorney, Larry Bronson, called the charges
``nonsense.''
   ``We know less than you know, that's how ridiculous this is,''
said Bronson, who also represented DiGilio.
   An attorney for Casella, Maureen Mantineo, did not return a
telephone message.
   Casella, Manna and DeSciscio were held without bail pending a
court hearing Friday in Newark. Bail was set at amounts between
$10,000 and $200,000 for the other defendants, said First Assistant
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.
