<LEADPARA>  FOR the ballet comeback of recent years, I nominate choreographer Michael
Smuin.;   Since being unceremoniously sacked as the San Francisco Ballet
artistic director in the early 1980s, the 53-year-old Smuin has received Emmy
and Tony awards.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His latest coup came when the American Ballet Theatre tapped him to create
the world premiere of "Peter and the Wolf," to be unveiled on the very stage
of his triumphs and griefs: the Opera House in San Francisco, on Jan. 18.;  
He may have decided by now that being fired was the best thing that ever
happened to him. But not one of his 50 or so ballets in the San Francisco
Ballet warehouse has been presented here since his departure.;   "Peter and
the Wolf" will come to San Francisco in ABT's annual Opera House stand Jan.
14-19. Other works being presented on the ABT visit include Antony Tudor's
"Undertow"; Vladimir Vasiliev's "Don Quixote"; George Balanchine's "Theme and
Variations"; David Blair's "Swan Lake (Act 2)"; and Clark Tippet's "Bruch
Violin Concerto No. 1." The full-length "Don Quixote" will take up the first
four performances Jan. 14-17.;   FROM ROCK TO ROYAL BALLET -- PBS's "Great
Performances" will present dance again this season. Leading off will be a look
at rock videos on "Everybody Dance Now" (KTEH, Ch. 54, Oct. 6 at 3 p.m.),
which features performers such as Michael Jackson, Willi Ninja, Mr. Wiggles
and Crazy Legs.;   Coming later in the season will be Paul Taylor and His
Company in the profile-performance "Speaking in Tongues," and then "La
Bayadere," as restaged for Britain's Royal Ballet by Natalia Makarova and
performed by the Kirov Ballet. Altynai Asylmuratova will dance the title role.
