<LEADPARA>  THERE'S a reason many of us don't take vacations, especially with the family.
It's too exhausting. Family vacation -- now there's an oxymoron. And when you
are outnumbered by your children four to two, as we are, it's no wonder we
have not, gone on family holiday since 1987.;   Americans don't take vacations
seriously enough, while Europeans consider their four- to six-week holidays
absolutely sacred. Most Americans are still struggling just to get three weeks
off.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For reasons I can't now explain, Tom and I decided we should take at least
one family vacation while we all are still able to fit into European cars.;  
As soon as our oldest son, 17, heard our plans, he opted to stay home and
"party" rather than suffer the humiliation of traveling around with the family
circus.;   So we went to France with only three children, ages 6, 9 and 12. We
arrived in Paris early on a Thursday morning and as usual in August, the city
was as empty as . . . Paris in August.;   That day was a religious holiday. It
was celebrated later by buses full of Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and other
Eastern Europeans -- not a Parisian in sight -- converging into the center of
the city.;   Paris knocks your socks off with how unbelievably expensive it
is. A cup of coffee costs $3. All the Eastern Europeans could do was look at
the sights and stay on the bus. But they were thrilled for even that rare
opportunity.;   Even though we did not see any other Americans, there were
"Americans" all over Europe. The American "tourist slob" look has been adopted
by Europeans with a vengeance. Everyone wears baggy shorts, fanny packs and
T-shirts with improbable logos such as: "Funseth University -- Home of the
Sports.";   A great deal of traveling is, well, traveling. The word means
"work" in French. We labored, all five of us, by plane, by train, by car and
ferry to get to our destination, Corsica.;   Rental cars in Europe are the
size of midget clown cars -- not much room to fight in. And before complaining
about the price of gas in the United States, consider this: In Europe it's
close to $6 a gallon.;   We also discovered how wonderfully good-natured our
youngest daughter is. She was always obliged to sit in the middle between her
often feuding siblings. She giggled, laughed and exclaimed her pleasure at the
sights and sounds. And whenever we went around curves, the screams of laughter
from their invented game of "rag doll" reverberated through the car.;   One
night driving back from Cannes to the hotel in the hills above Nice, we got
lost. My husband and I rarely fight, but when we do, it occurs in the car. All
of our major fights have occurred in a car: hell in a very small place.;  
This time I was driving and he was navigating. Actually, I prefer driving and
not taking the rap for getting lost; it's much less nerve-racking. No matter
which way we went, we seemed to end up in the same place.;   At one point, we
stopped and asked directions from a couple playing bocce in a small square.
Each pointed in the opposite direction.;   Our 12-year-old was apprehensively
listening to his parents bickering, one of the few times he'd ever heard us
disagree. Every once in a while, he'd exclaim cheerfully: "Are we having fun
yet? Gee, this is a great adventure!" and "You're not going to get a divorce
over this, are you?";   Tom gloated as my efforts came to naught. I triumphed
silently as his directions turned out to be wrong. Happily, that night neither
one of us was right. We are still married.  </TEXT>
