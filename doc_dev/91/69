STELLAR is, we believe, as stellar does. The 'stars' of American Ballet in
Britain on a brief visit, and at Northampton's admirable Derngate Theatre
this week, are principals and soloists with American Ballet Theatre and New
York City Ballet, though not quite those originally scheduled. (Admirers of
Darci Kistler should note that this wonderful dancer is not with the group).
There was something resolutely unstellar about the fare at Tuesday's
opening, and even more so about the presentation. A round of applause for
the only design element - a silhouette of the New York skyline - is a sure
sign that we are in starvation corner, where the rule is black drapes and
dreary outfits.
The evening was not a happy one. It is, indeed, one of those occasions when
you wonder 'Can it get worse?', and the reply from the stage is a determined
'Yes'. The opening Apollo - Robert LaFosse, with Susan Jaffe, Melissa
Podcassy, Sandra Brown - was respectable enough, I suppose, but LaFosse is
altogether too winning in manner for my taste (the young god as head waiter)
and the Muses breezed through their solos without looking very closely at
them. This Apollo, and the succeeding Some Assembly Required, a serious, if
neurotic, duet by Clark Tippet which ABT showed us a couple of years ago,
were the only valid matters of the evening. What followed defied belief,
defied the idea of ballet as a serious art, and, I suppose, defied us to
start throwing ripe fruit.
In Come Unto Me Bruce Padgett, got up like Michael Jackson as Captain Hook,
bayed some rock music (of his own confection) while three chaps and a girl
trudged through his dances amid dry ice and relentless noise. The men were,
I think, trying to develop their pectorals. The girl, with the erotic frenzy
characteristic of Olive Oyl, offered herself to the lads. Nonsense reigned.
Johann Renvall's version of the Romeo and Juliet balcony pas de deux was
cliche-time in Old Verona: everything you have ever seen about two lovers in
this situation, and hoped never to sit through again. LaFosse's Spring Break
was soaked in dew, as three girls and four men were ecstatic, too youthful,
and gorge-risingly cute. The score, by Martin Stock, could have been
composed by Mendelssohn's aunt. So could the choreography. The costumes made
the dancers look bulgy. The dances made them look foolish. The last moments
of this degringolade were concerned with LaFosse's A Salute to Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers in which five couples dashed inelegantly about while gems
from Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin et al, were nailed to the floor in
four-square and mushy piano arrangements. The title, is, of course, wrong.
It is a salute to Fred Rogers and Ginger Astaire - looking at it, you knew
why you'd never heard of them before. And never wanted to again.
Stars of American Ballet are at The Derngate Theatre, Northampton, until 4
September.
