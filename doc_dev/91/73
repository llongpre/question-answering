BLAKE EDWARDS' LATEST ONLY 'SKIN DEEP'

Blake Edwards' "Skin Deep" (citywide) has a couple of the funniest moments 
Edwards ever devised; it has John Ritter's easy-to-take charm, but it ends up 
living up to its title far too closely. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter's Zach has it all. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, a novelist 
and screenwriter. He has a bright, attractive wife (crisply played by Alyson 
Reed), who's a TV newscaster, a profession that in the movies defines the 
successful contemporary woman. He lives the Southern California life style at 
its most sybaritic. You have the feeling that this is a man who hasn't stepped 
outside Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Malibu for year, except possibly to escape 
to other equally luxe locales; by the end of the film you're left feeling that 
this may be true of Edwards as well. 
</P>
<P>
The film opens with a hilarious double whammy that starts Zach spinning out of 
control even before the laughter starts fading. From then on it's a downhill 
slide for Zach. Already plagued by writer's block, he gives in to compulsive 
womanizing, followed by incipient alcoholism and eventual impotence. 
</P>
<P>
"Skin Deep" is a film of moments, some of which are terrific, others 
considerably less so. The glamour girls, with their great sheafs of shining 
hair, are interchangeable, but there are nice turns by Vincent Gardenia as 
Zach's barkeep pal and by Nina Foch as his chic mother-in-law, perhaps the only 
woman in the world who has never been charmed by him. There's real sweetness 
and humor in Raye Hollit's body builder, and once again Edwards proves himself 
one of the few American film makers able, or willing, to present a gay couple 
(in this instance played distinctively by Peter Donat and Don Gordon) without a 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
As adept as Edwards is at using humor to set off Zach's self-destructiveness, 
to capture the dark undertow of high living, he ends up letting Zach off the 
hook shamelessly. It's as if Edwards said to himself: "The poor guy has 
suffered long enough, and, besides, we're running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Never has a happy ending been so thoroughly unearned. For all his charm, 
honesty and intelligence -- you have no trouble understanding his appeal to a 
wide variety of women -- Zach does nothing to help himself as he gives in to 
epic self-indulgence. Then in his turnaround, we're given the impression that 
stopping drinking and turning out a best seller are snaps for Zach. (That his 
wife would even consider taking him back after his progressively outrageous 
behavior is also confounding.) 
</P>
<P>
In short, "Skin Deep" is a male sex fantasy that says that if you're 
sufficiently rich, famous and good-looking, you can go into the most 
self-destructive of tailspins and still land on your feet without any real 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
It's chilling to imagine "Skin Deep" (rated R for sex and language, adult 
situations) without Ritter, who through sheer dint of his own likability, never 
quite loses our sympathy for Zach. (This admittedly may not be true for some 
women in the audience; NOW is unlikely to choose the film for a benefit 
premiere.) Ritter and Edwards clearly have a strong rapport and plan to work 
together again. Perhaps the next time will rate a "10."
