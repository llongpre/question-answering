<LEADPARA>  WHEN American Ballet Theater performs in San Francisco in late March, the
company roster will include Michael Smuin, of all people.;    Smuin, former
head of San Francisco Ballet, started his ballet career with ABT, where he was
a principal dancer from 1969 to 1973, when he became co-artistic director of
SFB. (After he and SFB parted company 12 years later, Helgi Tomasson succeeded
him.) Since then, he has directed and choreographed Broadway musicals such as
"Anything Goes" and the recent "Shogun."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At 53, Smuin is as spry as ever, though his thick shock of hair is now
fully silver. Always better known as a character dancer than a danseur noble,
he returns in the same repertory, dancing the role of Dr. Coppelius in ABT's
new production of "Coppelia" (March 28-31).;    (This is a time-honored
tradition among male dancers of a certain age. San Jose Cleveland Ballet's
Dennis Nahat dances the role of the grumpy toy maker in his company's version
of "Coppelia," and Rudolf Nureyev, 52, danced it with SJCB last summer at the
Edinburgh Festival. That marked the first time Nureyev had performed any role
in the ballet other than Franz, the hero.);    Actually, the production is not
new but a reworking of the 1968 version by ABT ballet master emeritus Enrique
Martinez. However, it hasn't been seen in a while, so it qualifies as "new."; 
  Also, the long-stemmed French ballerina Sylvie Guillem will make her ABT
debut in San Francisco. After leaving Nureyev's Paris Opera Ballet, she danced
as a guest artist with the Royal Ballet for two seasons, where her extensions
raised the eyebrows and temperatures of London's stuffy dance critics.;   
ABT's Cynthia Gregory received a lifetime achievement award from the National
Arts Club last month. Gregory, 45, is the only dancer and youngest artist to
receive this award in the club's 93-year history.; Graham crackers; When the
Persian Gulf war broke out, Martha Graham Dance Company had a Paris engagement
booked. It was canceled because the American Guild of Musical Artists refused
to give permission for her dancers, who are all AGMA members, to travel
because of the danger of airport terrorism.;    Like most national dance
troupes, Graham's company relies on touring for the bulk of its income. The
Paris cancellation means $140,000 in lost fees, according to its management.; 
  Graham, who is 96 and just out of the hospital after a bout with pneumonia,
accepted the lifetime achievement award Monday of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America. Designers such as Halston and Calvin Klein have been
among those who have created costumes for her company.; Cheers; Dance
magazine's 1991 awards went to choreographer Mark Morris; Virginia Johnson,
principal dancer with Dance Theater of Harlem; and ace lighting designer
Jennifer Tipton.;    San Jose State University shows off its three new dance
studios at an open house, 1 to 4 p.m. March 14. The dance program moved over
Christmas break to Washington Square Hall, the former Old Science Building, on
Fourth Street between San Fernando and San Carlos streets. The open house
features performances, guided tours and refreshments. Information: (408)
924-4551.; Passages; Richard Englund, 59, co-director of the Joffrey II
chamber ballet, died Feb. 15 of cancer in New York. . . . On the same day,
Paul Russell, 43, a leading performer with Dance Theater of Harlem (1970-76)
and San Francisco Ballet (1981-86), died of complications related to AIDS in
San Francisco.;    The performances of Tracy Rhoades and his Exploding Roses
dance company last weekend were the swan song of The Lab, one of San
Francisco's busier spaces for experimental dance and theater. Its loft on
Divisadero Street is being closed because "intractable building code
deficiencies" would cost more than $50,000 to fix. This is more than the
parent company, The(dot)Art(dot)Re(dot)Grup, can afford. Lab-sponsored
activities in other venues will continue as planned, says director Alan
Millar.;    Comin' up; Lively Arts at Stanford will offer its first dance
series next season, according to dance-loving Lana Weeks, associate director
of marketing, who will program it. . . . Ohio Ballet, the chamber company from
Akron that performed at the Mountain View Center last weekend, has been signed
to appear on next season's Stars on Stage series at the University of
California, Santa Cruz.; Moves; ODC/San Francisco has hired Susan Davis
Cushing, former chief of staff for Festival 2000, as executive director. She
replaces Carol Tanenbaum, who took a medical leave and then became development
director for Oakland Ballet. . . . The 1991 Isadora Duncan Awards will move to
Fort Mason Center's Cowell Theater, a more user-friendly space for dance than
the former venue, Herbst Theater in the War Memorial.; Dance plus; Santa Cruz
dancers Karl Schaffer and Erik Stern, a.k.a. Dr. Schaffer and Mr. Stern, have
almost more bookings than they can handle -- the result of performing their
hourlong program on teaching math concepts through dance to the California
Math Educators last fall.;    Elementary and middle schools from Santa Cruz to
Sacramento grabbed at their show, a fast-paced introduction to the way math
intersects (See what I mean? A math word!) our lives.;    They expect even
more gigs when they perform for the western region of the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics, March 1992 in Eugene, Ore.;    Schaffer has a
doctorate in math and teaches at De Anza College in Cupertino when he's not
dancing. Stern is a member of Tandy Beal &amp; Company, Santa Cruz. (box)  </TEXT>
