FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Dancing into difficulties - American ballet companies
are losing their way

Last December The Red Shoes, a musical comedy based on the world's most
famous ballet movie, opened and closed on Broadway. It says something about
the current state of ballet in New York that, a few months later, both of
our major ballet companies were found serving up the funeral meats cold. At
American Ballet Theatre, one of the spring season's featured offerings -
indeed, a trumpeted event, with five performances added ('by popular
demand') before it even opened - was the silly little ballet that the modern
dance choreographer Lar Lubovitch had created for that musical.
Meanwhile, the star of The Red Shoes, Margaret Illmann of the National
Ballet of Canada, apparently no sooner got back to Toronto and fed her cat
than she got a call from New York City Ballet. Not to be outdone in the Red
Shoes salvage department, NYCB invited her to dance three guest performances
during the spring season.
A glamorous past, an aimless present feeding off that past while trying to
figure out whether there is going to be any future - that, right now, is the
story of ballet in New York.
In addition to The Red Shoes, ABT dredged up Antony Tudor's 1963 Echoing of
Trumpets, a highly sensationalist anti-war ballet (Nazis, gang rape on
point) and produced James Kudelka's Cruel World (to Tchaikovsky's 'Souvenir
de Florence'), a highly sensationalist new ballet not about war but about
how many slam-bang gymnastic pas de deux  - with the woman spun, swung,
flung, caught at the last possible second - you can pack into one ballet.
Six, as I recall.
But the major event of ABT's season was a new Nutcracker, choreographed by
company director Kevin McKenzie to a libretto by playwright Wendy
Wasserstein (The Sisters Rosensweig). Like so many Nutcracker-revisers,
Wasserstein has made the ballet more rational, more up-to-date. But above
all what she has done is make it more complicated.
This ballet has things no Nutcracker has ever needed before: unicorns,
Jewish jokes, four ballerinas. Meanwhile, the things a Nutcracker does need
 -a tree that grows, a battle that starts with the battle music, a party
scene where you can tell who the mother is - it doesn't have. Nor are there
any interesting dances. The big duet for Clara and her Nutcracker is an
almost comically ungainly number. The night I was there, the excellent
dancers Ashley Tuttle and Gil Boggs looked as though they were afraid they
were going to be killed.
While ABT invested most of its resources in this big, bad production, New
York City Ballet put its eggs in twelve little baskets. In 1992, the company
staged a festival called the Diamond Project, in which various
choreographers were asked to stage new ballets on a low budget.
This year, the Diamond Project was revived - the company now says it will be
a biennial event - and, as before, a great range of choreographers were
invited, veterans and tyros, company insiders (Damian Woetzel, Miriam
Mahdaviani, Robert LaFosse, Richard Tanner, Peter Martins) and outsiders
also (Kevin O'Day, Trey McIntyre, David Allan, Ulysses Dove, Lynn
Taylor-Corbett, Anna Laerkesen, John Allyne).
Basically, they produced two kinds of ballets. One was the complication
ballet, favoured by the company insiders - a ballet in which classical steps
are cut up into a thousand details, a thousand little prettinesses, in the
hope, it seems, of distracting the audience from the question of what it all
means.
The complication ballet is descended from one aspect of George Balanchine's
work, as reinterpreted by his successor as NYCB director, Peter Martins, and
it was Martins's contribution to the Diamond Project, Mozart Piano Concerto,
that provided the purest example. In the slow movement, the principal
dancers had so many niceties to cope with - turns tilted and twisted and
embellished and reversed halfway through - that they could barely dance.
This was not a ballet; it was a teacup - Louis XV.
More popular with the audience was the genre favoured by the outsider
choreographers: the alienation ballet. This, too, I believe, is descended
from Balanchine - from his stark 'leotard' ballets - but remotely. Its true
father is William Forsythe, the American choreographer who has had such a
success in Europe. In any case, what it looks like is a Calvin Klein
advertisement. To jarring music (Bartok, electric violins) stylish-looking
young people stand around in unitards looking sexy and disaffected.
Occasionally, they dance with each other; often they dance alone, and then
get bored and walk off stage.
A few promising pieces issued from these unpromising molds - Miriam
Mahdaviani's Correlazione, Richard Tanner's Episodes &amp; Sarcasms, Kevin
O'Day's Viola Alone - but that is three out of 12, and all three needed more
work. In a ballet world nearly void of interesting new choreography, the
Diamond Project sounds like a good idea - throw everybody into the pool, see
who swims - but perhaps it isn't. With so many choreographers, each is given
too small an honour, too small a challenge, and this may have contributed to
the extreme conventionality of their works. The company would probably be
better served by operating in the usual way: commissioning two or three
works and thus placing serious bets.
Apart from its general mediocrity, what struck one about the new ballet
choreography this spring was how very difficult it was. Dancers pirouetted
with their legs crossed; they somersaulted off their partners' shoulders;
they sweated and gasped. These are not the kinds of exertions that keep
ballet companies in shape. Both ABT and NYCB are fielding some thrilling
young dancers - notably, Ethan Stiefel and Jennifer Ringer at NYCB and
Paloma Herrera and Ashley Tuttle at ABT - at the same time that general
company standards are falling.
In a recent performance of Balanchine's Mozartiana at NYCB, the four woman
corps moved as if through custard. For this situation, various reasons have
been advanced, including the death of Balanchine and other revered masters.
('All our icons in the dance have pretty much passed on,' ABT principal
Cheryl Yeager said in a recent interview with Dance Magazine. 'We don't have
to cut off our heads to be ballet dancers any more.') The decline will only
be hastened, however, if choreographers, looking for something striking to
do, create steps so difficult that they cannot shape or phrase them - in
effect, cannot dance them - but only hope to get through them somehow.
