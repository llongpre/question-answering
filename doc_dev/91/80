THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS: THE TRUE STORY OF MAURICE CHEVALIER'S
LIFE AND TIMES
by Edward Behr
Hutchinson Pounds 18.99, 368 pages
LUCKILY we all remember Gigi otherwise Edward Behr's titles might suggest
that Maurice the Marvel was some kind of secret paedophile. It emerges that
he did prefer waiflike types of women to the more Rubensian ones, but they
had at least to have reached the age of consent. Among his innumerable
conquests were Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker and Kay Francis. But his
true love was, even after marriage, his old Mum. She was 36 when she had
him. Her no-good husband, Maurice's father, was a Parisian housepainter who
usually arrived home at night completely plastered (both senses).
Josephine Chevalier, with her pinched, pointy face, was of Flemish origin
known by Maurice and his brothers as La Louque, the name he afterwards gave
in her memory his magnificent estate in the South of France at La Bocca,
near Cannes. As a seamstress she was the family's breadwinner as well as
being a constant child-bearer (Maurice was ninth in the order). Jeanette
MacDonald, with whom he made movies for Paramount in his pre-war Hollywood
period - The Love Parade (1929) and Love Me Tonight (1932) - and who
absolutely loathed him (this revulsion being entirely mutual) said that Mama
was always Maurice's sole topic of conversation.
Behr's subtitle with its emphasis on the 'true' story implies that all the
previous ones have been untrue. Certainly the star's own nine volumes of
memoirs need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but which theatrical
monster's memoirs do not? This new life, by a practised hand at contemporary
biography, is well-researched and especially strong on the political
background, enlightening about the performing arts in Paris during the murky
period of the Occupation. But the main story seemed familiar, after an
excellent Radio 2 biography, This Was Maurice Chevalier with recorded
extracts from several friends quoted by Behr, first broadcast in 1988
compiled by Charles Castle.
The working-class French lad's emergence as a dancer from the down and out
suburb of Menilmontant via the world of the Paris cafe-concerts and music
halls onto the stage of the Folies-Bergere is well documented. His earliest
partner was a crazy woman called Frehel. Luckily, young Maurice did not
succumb to her addiction to cocaine. Then he partnered the great Mistinguett
when he was 23 and she 36 and with whom he at once started a prolonged
affair.
He had found his metier and whatever later triumphs he enjoyed on the world
stage, Maurice remained au fond a French vaudevillian. He could never sing
especially well, but he radiated magic, through his panache, his patter, his
good looks, his mock-hesitant yet perfect articulation, equally well-timed
in both English and French. He excelled at manipulation of the audience for
whom he became an irresistible embodiment of sexy, gallic, garlic-breathing
allure.
The debonair look with straw 'boater' was adopted in the 1930s. Behr says
Maurice borrowed the idea of the hat as an essential prop from Harry
Richman, an American comedian whom he 'had almost certainly seen' in London.
Could not both of them have got it from the Claude Hulbert upper-class,
blazered, silly ass of the PG Wodehouse musicals and the Aldwych farces?
After Maurice appeared jauntily sporting this headgear, sales of English
straw hats soared across the Channel; like Dame Edna and her gladioli,
Maurice would distribute them to his admirers after the show. Apart from
such public relations munificence, paid for no doubt by the management,
Maurice was in private life congenitally mean, never picking up any tab in a
restaurant if he could help it, hoarding his huge earnings.
These remained vast for much of his life. He hit a bad patch in 1935, when
he broke with MGM and was forced to return to France to re-awaken his
dormant native admirers. Then came the Second World War. Maurice had been
wounded in the first and had been awarded the Croix de Guerre. As a result
of that he now became an ardent Petainiste. But did Maurice turn his
immaculately cut coat and perform at the behest of the Nazi masters in front
of German audiences? Did he in fact collaborate? After the Liberation his
reputation suffered grievously for several years from the stigma that he
had.
Behr goes into the whole matter carefully. Maurice does not emerge completly
spotless from the detailed investigation. He performed in Germany in a
French POW camp near Magdeburg which sparked the slander; but he seems to
have been hardly more culpable under the Occupation than Jean Cocteau,
Colette and a number of stars of that generation whom we now hold in
affectionate memory. Maurice's constant companion during the war - Nita Raya
 -was Jewish; he certainly helped her and her parents to survive it
unscathed.
After his eventual exoneration and return to Hollywood, the story has a
fairy-tale quality. Maurice is not just rehabilitated, he is glowingly
rejuvenated. 'I'm glad I'm not young any more' he sings with utter
conviction, not believing a word of it. His success was largely thanks to
the renaissance of the American musical, the lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner and
the direction of Vincente Minnelli. Leslie Caron, who played opposite him as
the ingenue in Gigi (1958), thought Maurice was a cold fish; but everyone
else was charmed by the 70-year-old matinee idol. He was right back on top
again.
But it could not last for ever, and by the end of the 1960s he was in a
Lear-like decline, fantasising about being elected to the Academie
Francaise, cutting his faithful female friend Janie Michels and her children
out of his will, manipulated by others close to him, a prey to suicidal
depressions with at least one actual attempt. By now he really had been
forced to retire; no one wanted to employ him, even on television. He died
aged 83 on New Year's Day 1972, a sad, lonely, cheated old trouper.
The book is highly informative, but it has been carelessly edited. The
irritating trick of linking two sentences by a colon, eg 'In America, things
were perhaps even tougher: In many vaudeville theaters, entertainment was
continuous . . .' proliferates; that cannot, surely, be Behr's normal way of
punctuating. If for economic reasons we have to suffer American spelling,
surely we do not have to have such illiteracy foisted on us as well?
The story about Maurice performing at the Waldorf Astoria during a
musicians' strike is repeated word for word on pages 317 and 318. It seems
incredible this error should have got right through to the finished book.
Walter Hutchinson and Robert Lusty must be turning in their graves.
