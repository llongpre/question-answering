<LEADPARA>  OUR PRESENT hurry-up way of life has put an end to that old tradition of
dressing up and going into "town" -- not necessarily to buy anything, but just
for the experience of seeing and being seen.;   But some of the glamour of the
marketplace is still alive -- in mail-order catalogs. Once the most
rudimentary and unimaginative way of marketing products, catalogs now have
their own style and appeal.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Anything to do with outdoor living is always quick to catch my eye, and
each year, it seems, there are more catalogs offering "backyard
paraphernalia." Where I once had only a favorite store to browse through, I
now look forward to thumbing through many of my favorite catalogs.;   Two of
the best and most complete general catalogs for outfitting the backyard are
from Smith &amp; Hawken and Gardener's Eden.;   Both carry a wide array of
furniture, umbrellas, containers, fountains, garden equipment and other
accessories for outdoor living. The latest Gardener's Eden catalog even
includes a pair of French garden clogs so attractive they made it onto my
Christmas wish list. The products are so stylishly produced that they offer
plenty of ideas and inspiration for the backyard enthusiast.;   Lilypons Water
Gardens and Van Ness Water Gardens offer virtually every necessity for water
gardens -- from ponds to water lilies to koi -- which they'll ship to you
through the mail! Both are beautiful catalogs to peruse, and provide a great
deal of information for the beginning water gardener.;   The catalog from Wind
&amp; Weather presents a large selection of sundials and weather vanes -- good
gifts for those hard-to-buy-for types.;   Catalogs from Sporty's and World
Wide Games are veritable emporiums of indoor and outdoor games, from bocce to
badminton.;   From Philip Hawk &amp; Co. come stone garden lanterns carved by hand
in both classic and innovative, Japanese-inspired designs. These granite
lanterns are elegant and expensive, a lifetime investment in what the Japanese
term "shibusa," quiet refinement with a touch of the profound.;   Milaeger's
Gardens is known for its flowering perennial plants, but I was happy to see
this year the old-fashioned garden gazing ball among its offerings.;   The
Kinsman Co. catalog contains a good selection of quality garden equipment, and
a full line of German-made Wood-Crete birdhouses. Very popular in Europe for
more than 40 years, these birdhouses are designed with birds in mind.;   For
those interested in providing nesting places for birds, these birdhouses make
excellent gifts. You may not receive a thank-you note from any of your
feathered friends, but there's no doubt they'll appreciate your
thoughtfulness.;   While the social aspect of shopping may be missing in
mail-order catalogs, convenience is not.;   Being able to fulfill wishes any
time of the day or night, usually with a toll-free telephone call and a quick
conversation with a knowledgeable and expedient salesperson, is a real boon
for those short on time or patience.;   Now, if we could just convince more of
these firms to offer gift-wrapping and enclosure cards.;   IF YOU'RE
