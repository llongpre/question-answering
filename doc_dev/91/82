Even if Twyla Tharp were never to make another great dance, she would have
already long been a symbol, an American success story and an icon of
crossover. She is the 1960s experimentalist who in the 1970s choreographed
for the Joffrey Ballet (Deuce Coupe, to Beach Boys music), for Baryshnikov
and American Ballet Theatre (Push Comes To Shove) and for John Curry (After
All); and who in the 1980s choreographed for the movie of Amadeus, for New
York City Ballet and the Paris Opera.
For many of us, though, she made her very best work on her own dance
company. When that folded in the 1987-88 season, Baryshnikov took Tharp,
those dancers who chose to follow, her repertory (and, it was said, her
debts) into American Ballet Theatre, which he then directed. But only a
season later Baryshnikov left ABT; and when her three-year contract there
ended, Tharp left too, taking her dancers and most of her repertory with
her.
Now (like Baryshnikov and his White Oak Project) Tharp is working with a
pick-up group: ie a company that is hand-picked, rehearsed, sent out to
perform on tour, and then disbanded. Twyla Tharp and Dancers (her old
company used to be called Twyla Tharp Dance) was formed last autumn for an
Ohio State University residency, where it rehearsed at length, learnt two
new works (Octet and Men's Piece), several old ones, and then performed. On
January 28 the troupe opened a two-week New York season at City Center; it
has now gone on to Japan for three weeks, and there is talk of a European
tour in the summer.
For the New York season, Tharp presented another new work, Sextet, and also
Grand Pas: Rhythm of the Saints, a pas de deux she had made for the Paris
Opera last autumn. All four new works were warmly acclaimed by audiences;
and, unlike many of Tharp's 1980s productions, all were economically
produced and unobtrusively lit. Three of them were definitely ballet, with
women on pointe and with turned-out legs; and they raise the questions that
has kept growing larger ever since Tharp began choreographing for ballet
companies: is she really classical? Can she, the great crossover
choreographer, cross over the whole way?
If you can accept that there is much that is ballet that is not classical
and - more important - much that is classical that is not ballet, then you
can accept that Tharp was a classical choreographer before she ever came to
ballet.
She says that Men's Piece is about the twist: which, she reminds us, in the
late 1950s and the '60s tore men and women from each other's embrace. Will a
man and woman be able to dance together again? She tries various solutions.
The most exciting is a march for Tharp and all four guys, working together
on equal terms, filling the stage with one great dance arc after another;
and the most touching is an Astaire-type ballroom duet to Gershwin's 'He
Loves And She Loves', because Tharp shows not only the romance of bygone
convention but also her mixed feelings about committing herself to that.
The point of Men's Piece was to let us know that she is going to go on
experimenting. It was pleasingly unfinished, un-slick. A lecture-demo, a
collection of sketches in progress, a life-in-the-day-of-the choreographer,
it is a real grabbag work. No scenery; dancers in rehearsal kit. Tharp -
baggy overalls over her dance gear, her mop of hair now elegantly grey -
dances with her old lithe authority; and she talks - to her dancers, to the
sound technician and to us.
Septet and Octet reaffirm my belief that no choreographer today is working
in ballet with Tharp's command of the form's dance potential. (But then,
these are bleak days for ballet.) Sextet, a Latin ballet for three couples,
is set to a commissioned score by Bob Telson that mixes various Latin dance
rhythms with a basic bubble-rock beat. Tharp's choreography, masterfully
arranged round this, is a frothy carnival of steps, an audience pleaser, but
strangely anonymous.
Octet, to a new rock-cum-classical music by Edgar Meyer, is more tentative,
less amiable, more rewarding and more Tharpian. Its four couples - women in
black leotards and shorts, men in black vests and trousers, all against a
black backdrop - fuse ballet vocab. with streetwise, rock-related
characteristics. The mood keeps changing - aggressive, floating, sportive,
tense, ebullient - and one level of your mind floods with admiration just as
another thinks 'So what?' It is a remarkable work, but it is also Tharp
saying 'See what I can do.' (Her Opera pas de deux, Grand Pas: Rhythm of the
Saints, is something one wishes she could not do: a smug Parisian joke about
the standard classical ballet gala item.)
The season also featured five older Tharp works. The Little Ballet is one
she made in 1983 for Baryshnikov to Glazounov music. Not even Balanchine
made Glazounov sound so American and contemporary as Tharp does here; and
she makes her hero look not princely but modern. I have never known a Tharp
dance more limpid and open-hearted. Another '80s dance, The Golden Section
(from The Catherine Wheel, 1981), was under-rehearsed, but Nine Sinatra
Songs (1982), with its seven contrasting dance/love duets, was as
overwhelming as when the Tharp company danced it at Sadler's Wells in 1983.
From the 1970s came the revivals of two pop pieces - Ocean's Motion (1975),
a light bubblegum work to Chuck Berry songs, and Deuce Coupe - or, as Tharp
calls her latest version, Deuce Coupe IV. The characters here are just kids,
too; alongside the ballerina in white who, central to proceedings but
removed from them, goes through her lexicon of steps. Everyone else is pop,
swinging, rippling. The beauty - you can't miss it - is that she's Tharpian
too. Pop and classical meet as equals.
Tharp's illustrious array of dancers gives new significance to the word
'pick-up.' They come from New York City Ballet, from downtown New York
modern dance troupes, from the Paris Opera, from Tharp's own former company;
and several of them reached new highs in their careers. Here are just three:
the exquisite Delphine Moussin, on leave from the Paris Opera (she danced
the Deuce Coupe ballerina with ravishing stretch and delicacy); Robert
LaFosse, on leave from New York City Ballet (giving The Little Ballet his
own boyish sweetness); and Jamie Bishton, virile and spontaneous, a true
Tharpian who followed Tharp into American Ballet Theatre and, three years
later, out of it again.
But the great wonder was to see them and their colleagues together on the
same stage in the same choreography. True, this company will fold; true,
these dancers will go their several ways. And yet this season was a happy
one. It brought back something into the air that so many bygone Tharp
seasons used to bring and that had been missing: optimism.
