The New Year will bring the naming of a new music director of the Pacific 
Symphony, the usual impressive imports from the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society and a new production of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" by Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
We may not see the Royal Ballet of Britain, however, which had announced a 
United States tour for July 2 through Aug. 5. The Metropolitan Opera, one of 
the original presenters, now says that the company is having trouble raising 
funds and the Met is no longer involved in the tour. The three-city tour was to 
have included stops in New York, Washington and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, here are some music and dance picks for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC 
</P>
<P>
*The Pacific Symphony's search for a new music director resumes on Jan. 31 and 
Feb. 1 when Boston Symphony assistant conductor Carl St. Clair will lead the 
orchestra in a program of works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Joseph Canteloube at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair is the latest conductor in series of guest conductors that so far 
this season has included Lawrence Foster, Christopher Seaman, Stuart Challender 
and Toshiyuki Shimada. 
</P>
<P>
The contest continues on March 28 and 29 with Richard Buckley, former director 
of the Oakland Symphony, and on May 23 and 24, with Sergiu Comissiona, former 
New York City Opera conductor. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific's music adviser, Kazimierz Kord, who says that he is not a 
candidate, will conduct two pairs of concerts, on April 18 and 19 and on May 2 
and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra officials say that a decision will be announced this year.

31.
