   Two stars from Leningrad's Kirov Ballet will
appear as guest artists with the American Ballet Theater during the
company's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov, the ABT's artistic director, said Monday
that Altynai Assylmuratova and Faruk Ruzimatov will perform in ``La
Bayadere'' on May 28 and May 30. Natalia Makarova, who defected
from the Kirov in 1970, choreographed the full-length ballet for
the ABT.
   Baryshnikov, a Kirov dancer when he defected in Canada in 1974,
met with Kirov artistic director Oleg Vinogradov last December in
Paris.
   The first visit by Russian dancers to perform with an American
ballet company came in February when Nina Ananiashvili and Andris
Liepa of the Bolshoi Ballet danced in three pieces choreographed by
George Balanchine with the New York City Ballet.
