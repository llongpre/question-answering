<LEADPARA>  AT AMERICAN Ballet Theater, they take "mixed repertory" literally: quality as
well as style.;    Tuesday's program, a benefit for AIDS relief agencies,
featured an amazing debut by maverick French ballerina Sylvie Guillem, a guest
artist this season, who learned the demanding part of Lizzie Borden in Agnes
de Mille's expressionistic "Fall River Legend" (1948) in less than a week and
danced with brilliance and despair.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The program began with the same kind of ragged dancing that disfigured
opening night last week, this time in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's neoclassical
jewel, "Concerto" (1966). The corps was messy, and the six demi-soloists were
shamefully out of ensemble.;    Susan Jaffe again saved the day, illuminating
the nocturne with her musical awareness and long, leisurely lines. Howard Barr
gave a snappy performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's cheeky Piano Concerto No.
2.;    Twyla Tharp's "Brief Fling" (1990) isn't brief, but it's sometimes fun.
Tharp's self-indulgence has gotten worse over time, and this piece runs its
parody of grand ballet mannerisms into the ground, much like "Push Comes to
Shove.";    But the dancing covered the work's defects, especially the bravura
passages that Cheryl Yeager and Wes Chapman made look so easy. Red-haired
Kathleen Moore was also a delight in her internecine exchanges with a trio of
men in kilts.;    The music is great: English folk tunes arranged by the
Australian pianist Percy Grainger and systematically deconstructed by Michel
Colombier into a dark, angular, brooding fantasy. However, the ersatz Scottish
costumes, by fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, are even more self-indulgent than
the choreography.;    The long-stemmed Guillem, who will dance the title role
in the full-length romantic ballet "La Bayadere" ("The Temple Dancer") Friday,
walked out of the Paris Opera Ballet two years ago to look for more
challenging repertory.;    She went to the Royal Ballet to learn its flawless
classical discipline and got uncomfortable reviews from the stodgy London
critics for her showy technique and -- well -- French dancing style.;    One
would have thought American modern ballet would be the last thing she'd want
to do, much less look good in. But she reined in what is clearly a prodigious
technique to explore the psychology of a young woman reduced by her hateful
stepmother to a self-fulfilling prophecy of repression and rage.;    The
production met her halfway, with Victor Barbee gallant and tender as the
preacher; Christine Dunham as Lizzie's adored mother, who dies young; and
Georgina Parkinson as the inhumanly righteous stepmother. Oliver Smith's set,
a frame house that becomes the gallows, is a marvel of economy, though his
backdrops of stormy skies now look melodramatic.; American Ballet Theater;
