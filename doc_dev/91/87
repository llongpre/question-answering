The year is going, let him go;/Ring out the false, ring in the true. Such
Tennysonian thoughts could be those of dance-lovers after twelve months of
false ballets; false dancing; false dealing; false repertories, and false
seasons.
A critic's - this critic's - accounts for 1993 are dismaying. Artistic
falsehoods abounded. How else to explain the Royal Ballet's diabolical
version of Don Quixote, in which not one single ingredient - design, text,
score, production, performance - was right, and a wonderful old ballet was
served up, in Coral Browne's memorable phrase about an actor 'like two tons
of condemned veal'. Consider, too, Glen Tetley's La Ronde, which was
deposited on the Opera House stage like an old Wienerschnitzel, with the
activities of its copious scenery more interesting than the relentless grind
(in any sense of the word) of its choreography. This was the year of David
Bintley's gnat-busy Tombeaux, and of his awful misreading of Sylvia for
Birmingham Royal Ballet. We were also faced with less than triumphant
novelties in a recent programme that went under the witless title of
White-hot and Different, with another piece from William Forsythe to hit out
at us, short but aggressive, like a child mugger.
The restoration of Ballet Imperial with nearly all the glorious Berman
designs, albeit not quite enough of the glorious dancing, was good news, as
were Irek Mukhamedov's appearances as Balanchine's Apollo (a grand hellenic
torso) and the Prodigal Son. He was also outstanding as Romeo, in Judas Tree
(which looked very fine), and seemed like Sisyphus as he tried to give some
momentum to Don Quixote.
Nina Ananiashvili was seen at the Opera House as a grand and Russian
Firebird (with Stuart Cassidy an excellent Ivan), and Darcey Bussell showed
an ideal physical sympathy for her Balanchine roles - clear and ardent.
Debut of the year at Covent Garden was Sarah Wildor's memorably intense and
luminous Juliet, exquisite, bright with promise.
Also on the side of truth, Birmingham Royal Ballet brought Ninette de
Valois' noble Job back to Covent Garden, and then took it to Coventry
cathedral (Dame Ninette had long hoped to see it in such a setting). We
admired Marion Tait and Miyako Yoshida, and the return of Massine's
Choreartium showed the troupe at its best. Standards of classic dancing were
otherwise less sure, and both Sleeping Beauty and Romeo were under-manned.
English National Ballet gained Derek Deane as a welcome new director, put on
a serious Bolshoi-style Swan Lake and a traditional Sleeping Beauty. The
best news was that Deane had started to polish the ensemble: performances in
Beauty looked truer, sharper than for years. Thomas Edur remains a shining
example of aristocratic style allied to dramatic sensitivity, and is thereby
unique on our ballet-scene. The indomitable London City Ballet - which, I
must suppose, Heaven rather than the Arts Council is determined to save -
closed and then re-opened. Hurrah] Hurrah, too, for Kim Brandstrup's Arc
Dance, also not favoured by the Arts Council, which continued to produce
valuable dance with Brandstrup's Antic.
The year's abundant falsities included suspect and fearsome goods from home
and abroad. I list, from a sense of duty but with considerable distaste:
Maurice Bejart's Lausanne troupe which brought farragos about Chaplin and
Italy that were a vexation to the spirit, and vehicles for Sylvie Guillem
(Sisi) and Koen Onzia (The Miraculous Mandarin, with Onzia as a transvestite
tart) which were made bearable by their central performances. The ill-named
Stars of American Ballet, Prague Festival Ballet, Batsheva from Israel,
Nederlands Dans Theater 2 (wonderful dancers; insupportable repertory) and
Nederlands Dans 3 (sheltered accommodation for dancers over 40); Scottish
Ballet looking glum in an unlikely Anna Karenina; the Cholmondelys and the
Featherstonehaughs in the tiresome Precious; Northern Ballet Theatre in a
spirit-lowering triple bill and an inexcusable Cinderella; an apotheosis of
Euro-trash in The Place's Dance Workshop Europe: these, and many more,
celebrated the rule of the tasteless or the inept.
The single worst event of the year - and like the Chinese water torture it
was slow and inexorable in its eight weeks of inadequacy - was the
Anglo-American television survey Dancing on BBC2, which combined garrulity
with political correctness and a stupefying inability to cope with its
subject. And as the apotheosis of what was wrong with 1993, let me cite the
proposed re-shaping of London Contemporary Dance Theatre (a troupe of which
we can be unabashedly proud) and the anticipated expansion of Rambert Dance
which, without Richard Alston, (who gave it an uncompromising but clear
image), is an unknown quantity. Contemporary dance is at the crossroads -
and that is where the dirty work takes place.
There were, though, great truths on view. The New York City Ballet's eight
week Balanchine Festival, featuring 73 of the master's works, was a grand
achievement, made even more glorious for me by the performances of Kyra
Nichols, who can do no wrong. I reported with greatest pleasure on
performances at the Paris Opera where the repertory is lively, and the dance
is radiant, both from such etoiles as the flawless Elisabeth Platel, Manuel
Legris and the recently promoted Nicholas LeRiche, and from serried ranks of
hugely gifted youngsters. Twyla Tharp's company and her dances also looked
very good on a visit to the Paris Opera.
Our own major visitors came from Russia. The Kirov made an odd impression at
the Coliseum. Their version of the Lavrovsky Romeo was a mistaken choice;
the omnipresent and flashy Julia Makhalina was not the best advertisement
for Petersburg classic style, and Farukh Ruzimatov removed himself after a
few self-parodying performances. Happily, certain younger ballerinas - Irina
Shapchits, Veronika Ivanova, Larissa Lezhnina - and the corps de ballet were
there to tell us of Kirovian excellence.
The Bolshoi stormed the Albert Hall. Here, I fear, is the shape of ballet to
come: huge arena, pop presentation, expensive tickets, dance as a
gladiatorial art, and seek in vain for many niceties of style or
choreography. Big ballet equals big bucks. The Grigorovich repertory can
sustain this exposure; the traditional classics looked bleached, beached.
There were heart-whole performances from the Bolshoi's dancers, with such
newcomers as Andrey Uvarov, Sergey Filin, Yury Klevtsov, Elena Palshina a
delight to see. And at the Edinburgh Festival, Mark Morris - despite losing
his theatre - reasserted the rule of fine and subtle choreography with his
thrilling Liebeslieder Waltzer and a triple bill, appreciatively recorded
here by Alastair Macaulay.
In surveying the year, certain things must be recalled with especial
gratitude. I have mentioned the unflawed dancing of Elisabeth Platel and
Kyra Nichols. The appearance of Mikhail Baryshnikov with the White Oaks
Project for two nights at Sadler's Wells, showed us sublimest artistry. At
an age when most male dancers have hung up their shoes, Baryshnikov - in
pieces by Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris - was as brilliant, as rhythmically
vivid and physically exhilarating, as the young divinity we first saw in
1970, and the great artist we knew in the succeeding decades. It was
miraculous dancing, life-enhancing. And Life-enhancing in a very different
way was a performance by Amici, a group of men and women variously and
seriously handicapped, who, under the leadership of Wolfgang Stange,
produced a dance piece (The Journey) which spoke eloquently of their
problems, of their aspirations, and of their gifts. Unlike much of what 1993
brought us, Amici's work is of great value.
