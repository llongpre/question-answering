   Choreographer Robert Joffrey, who founded a
dance troupe on a shoestring and built the Joffrey Ballet into one
of the nation's top companies, died this morning. He was 57.
   Joffrey, who had curtailed his duties at the company because of
illness, died at 6 a.m. at New York University Hospital, said
Pennie Curry, a spokeswoman for the company.
   He had suffered from a liver ailment caused by medication he was
receiving for asthma and a muscle condition, and had been in
intensive care for two weeks, she said.
   A lifelong asthmatic, Joffrey suffered severe asthma attacks in
August and had been working from his home since then, she said.
   Joffrey became ill in April 1986 and was diagnosed as having
severe myositis, which causes deterioration of the muscles,
enlarged liver and asthma. Earlier this month, he announced a
three-person advisory group to help Gerald Arpino, the company's
associate director, run the company.
   ``He had a passion and a love for dance. He respected dancers so
much. He loved to bring dance to parts of thew world that had never
seen it,'' said Gary Chryst, a former member of the Joffrey who
dance with the company for 11 years.
   In 1956, Joffrey borrowed a station wagon and sent his fledgling
dance company _ six dancers, one of whom could double on piano _
out to tour the United States. He stayed in New York, where he held
a job to pay for the tour.
   Today, the Joffrey Ballet ranks with the New York City Ballet
and American Ballet Theater as one of America's big three ballet
companies.
   Joffrey built by far the most far-ranging repertory. Nobody had
ever tried to recreate Vaslov Nijinsky's 1913 ``The Rite of
Spring,'' but Joffrey engaged two dance historians to see whether
they could recreate the ballet. The Joffrey version opened last
September in Los Angeles.
   Joffrey brought into the company ballets of strong classical
base and flowing quality by the British Royal Ballet's Frederick
Ashton; the 1932 stylized anti-war masterpiece, ``The Green
Table,'' by Kurt Jooss; a group of ballets created for Serge
Diaghilev; John Cranko's full-length ``Romeo and Juliet,'' dances
by American choreographers from Agnes de Mille to the avant-garde.
His own ballets include ``The Nutcracker'' in 1987 and his striking
1967 ``Astarte,'' where a couple dance in front of a billowing
white silk curtain on which a movie of them dancing is projected.
   Joffrey was the first artistic director to invite experimental
modern-dance choreographers to work with a major ballet company. He
brought Twyla Tharp to ballet in 1973. Arpino, one of the original
six dancers, is resident choreographer.
   Money was always a problem for the company, and Joffrey was
innovative in solving it. He decided that two bases were better
than one and announced a bi-coastal company, with boards and
fund-raising in both New York and Los Angeles.
   Last summer, he worked on his $1.5 million production of ``The
Nutcracker'' in Iowa City, Iowa, with one-third of the money coming
from New York, Los Angeles and the University of Iowa, where it
premiered.
   Joffrey was born Abdullah Jaffa Anver Bey Khan, in Seattle, Dec.
24, 1930. His father was a native of Afghanistan and his mother was
Italian. He had asthma as a child and a doctor suggested that he
take dance classes, for the breathing exercises.
   He started dance classes in Seattle, studied at the School of
American Ballet in New York and later with two modern-dance
teachers. His short performance career began with a solo concert of
his own works in Seattle. He danced with Roland Petit's Ballets de
Paris in 1949 and from 1950-52 danced sometimes in the concert
group of one of his modern-dance teachers, May O'Donnell.
   The Robert Joffrey Ballet Concert performed at New York's YMHA
in 1954 but Joffrey dated the founding of his company from 1956,
when he taught six dancers four pieces he had choreographed and
sent them out in a station wagon to 23 cities. Tours were annual
through 1964.
   Joffrey taught at the High School of Peforming Arts and
choreographed for the New York City Opera and other opera
companies, including choreographing ``Alcina'' in Dallas in which
Joan Sutherland made her American debut.
   By the spring of 1962, the company had 38 dancers and 21
ballets. That fall, the government sent the Joffrey Ballet on a
15-week tour of the Middle East. It was co-sponsored by the Rebekah
Harkness Foundation. The foundation sponsored the Joffrey Ballet
until March 1964 when Rebekah Harkness Kean decided to use the
money for a new Harkness Ballet, keeping dancers, costumes, sets,
scores and choreography from the previous two years.
   The Ford Foundation made a grant to get the Joffrey Ballet going
again. Joffrey did intense fund-raising and re-established the
company,which became the resident dance company at the City Center
in New York.
   Joffrey did not do much choreography in recent years. He
choreographed part of a new production of ``The Nutcracker Suite''
that was performed this year; his last full production,
``Postcards,'' was performed during the 1970s.
   He left no immediate survivors.
   Ms. Curry said a memorial service would be scheduled at a later
date. A viewing was planned for Frank B. Campbell's Funeral Home on
Sunday and Monday.
