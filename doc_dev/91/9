ABT'S BRIEF AND FRENZIED FLING WITH THARP

A year go, Twyla Tharp was a provocative fixture at American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov -- the matinee idol who ran the company when he wasn't too 
busy making movies or acting in plays or dancing elsewhere -- had elected the 
irresistibly iconoclastic choreographer as his "artistic associate." Going 
straight, in her finely frenzied fashion, Tharp disbanded her touring ensemble 
and joined the ABT team. 
</P>
<P>
She took some of her specialized repertory with her, not to mention a few of 
her own dancers. The collaboration with Baryshnikov &amp; Co. produced some 
appealingly gutsy work as well as some lavish show-bizzy fizzles. Then came the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov quit Ballet Theatre in a managerial huff. Tharp's name disappeared 
from the managerial roster. 
</P>
<P>
Her future with the company remains clouded. Her present, however, remains 
dazzling, and pleasantly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
The latest addition to the Tharp oeuvre, first applauded in San Francisco a 
week ago and introduced at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Thursday, is a legacy of the Baryshnikov era. It bears what may be a prophetic 
title: "Brief Fling." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the fling refers -- or at least pretends to refer -- to a 
charming highland ritual. This is Tharp's Scottish symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind searching for sylphides. Tharp's fling is fast and furious, taut and 
tense. It is refined on the surface yet rough inside. Or is it vice-versa? One 
is never quite sure, and that adds to the compelling intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, the ballet looks reasonably polite. It strikes amusing, even 
dainty poses. Then it takes off in potentially suicidal flights, often for 
their own frantic sake. Eventually, Tharp chooses some shocking structural and 
dynamic detours. 
</P>
<P>
The quaint becomes dangerous. The cheer turns dark. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Colombier provided the loud -- too loud -- musical impetus for this 
fusion of strict classicism and feverish adventure. Manipulating the 
technological miracles of tape and computer, he concocted a sonic tapestry that 
innocently explores the country gardens and stranded Handels of Percy Grainger, 
only to succumb to the easy dissonances and portentous rumbles we associate 
with horror flicks. 
</P>
<P>
The score may suggest candy-coated modernism. The choreography, thank goodness, 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
It toys brazenly with a tippy-toe tattoo. It showcases a frenzied ballerina in 
a tartan tutu, partnered by a fearless, airborne cavalier. It adds the casual 
counterforce of some muscular modernists who happen to specialize in bravura 
funk. In a bizarre, perfectly coordinated, essentially symmetrical suite of 
fugues and gigues, flirtations and confusions, the twain eventually meet. 
</P>
<P>
If the clash of impulses is unsettling, its progress is organic and its 
resolution strangely comforting. Cheryl Yeager, the brilliant ballerina, and 
Julio Bocca, her firebrand partner, become more interesting as they shed their 
royal manners. Resident Tharpians -- the devastating Shelley Washington, 
accompanied by Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and Jamie Bishton -- become even more 
compelling when they stretch for classical impact. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting corps includes such energetic paragons as Claudia Alfieri, 
Isabella Padovani, Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace. They sustain the aura of 
mock-nationalistic unity and bridge the stylistic gap with splendid, overwound 
bravado. 
</P>
<P>
In this ultracompact 20-minute opus, Tharp redefines conventional rules of 
partnering. She mocks the traditions she observes. More important, perhaps, she 
understands the tradition she mocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Brief Fling" bristles with nervous outbursts, yet dares unwind just when one 
expects a final zonking climax. It shouts its abstract drama. That makes its 
occasional whisper of lyricism all the more affecting. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Mizrahi has decorated the piece with a bizarre jumble of parody costumes. 
Misplaced plaids and tilted tams adorn a generally courtly corps. Some of the 
men sport formal kilts but no shirts. Baggy slacks coexist with prissy toe 
shoes. The sartorial worlds collide neatly, tellingly. 
</P>
<P>
One sees obvious texts and complex subtexts here. Tharp has much going on. Too 
much, perhaps, for one to absorb in a single viewing. The prospect of 
repetitions -- many and frequent -- is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
ABT surrounded the novelty with familiar fare. When, one had to wonder, will 
Tharp come up with the full-length ballet she owes us. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with the ubiquitous "Kingdom of the Shades" episode from "La 
Bayadere." Susan Jaffe served as a radiant Nikiya, nobly partnered by Kevin 
MacKenzie as Solor and unevenly seconded by Leslie Browne, Cynthia Anderson and 
Christine Dunham as her fluttery attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 ghostlets in white executed their Petipa arabesques rather shakily. The 
brisk tempos favored by Emil de Cou hardly reinforced the aura of otherworldly 
languor, but Ron Oakland (uncredited in the program) performed the violin solos 
exquisitely. 
</P>
<P>
A kind and gentle performance of Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" completed the bill. 
Shawn Black -- still ranked a member of the corps de ballet -- undertook the 
central conflicts of the cowgirl for the first time, and did so sweetly if a 
bit sketchily. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown didn't strut much stuff in his debut as the head wrangler, and 
Julie Kent seemed content to be blandly pretty in her first outing as the other 
woman. John Gardner returned as the sympathetic, soft-grained champion roper. 
Leading the excellent Pacific Symphony, Jack Everly served Copland heartily in 
the pit.
