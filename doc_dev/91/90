  [Excerpts] There is no coldness on the part of the Israeli 
Government towards Italy, only friendship: these were the words 
of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who recalled that a 
Jerusalem daily newspaper today said that the views of the 
Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, on the Italian 
Government were irresponsible. [passage omitted] 
  Avi Pazner, the Israeli ambassador to Rome, met with Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino for the second time in three days. 
This is what he told our reporter at the end of the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Pazner] We had a good meeting with 
Foreign 
Minister Martino. We spoke of the relations between Israel and 
Italy -- relations which we hope will continue to be good in the 
future. We spoke of the future meeting between Martino and 
Shim'on Peres in Luxembourg next Monday [13 June]. 
  [Correspondent Paolo Borelli] Will the misunderstandings be 
overcome? Will this cultural protocol be signed? 
  [Pazner] We hope that the misunderstandings will be overcome 
because there is a willingness on the part of Italy and Israel 
to overcome these difficulties. 
  [Borelli] In general, does the Israeli Government remain 
concerned at the presence of members of the National Alliance in 
our government? 
  [Pazner] There is a debate currently taking place in Israel. 
All that has happened in the last few days is a result of this 
debate. We must now find a way of continuing the good relations 
which exist between Israel and Italy. [end recording]
