  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Milan Public Prosecutor's 
office has sensationally asked for 37 politicians and 
businessmen involved in the Enimont affair to stand trial. This 
was the same affair for which financier Sergio Cusani was tried 
and found guilty. Dario Carella reports from the Milan 
courthouse. 
  [Carella] [passage omitted] Chief Public Prosecutor Borrelli 
said that Deputy Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has requested to 
Examining Judge Italo Ghitti that 37 people, mostly politicians, 
stand trial on various charges connected with the Enimont 
investigation. Among the 37 are Northern League leader Umberto 
Bossi, former Northern League treasurer Alessandro Patelli, 
[former Prime Minister] Bettino Craxi, [Italian Republican Party 
leader] Giorgio La Malfa, [former Justice Minister] Claudio 
Martelli, [former Italian Liberal Party leader] Renato 
Altissimo, Pino Berlini, Luigi Bisignani, Montedison's Carlo 
Sama, ENI's Alberto Grotti, [former Foreign Minister] Gianni De 
Michelis, [former Christian Democratic Party Treasurer] Severino 
Citaristi, [former Prime Minister] Arnaldo Forlani, [former 
Italian Liberal Party Minister] Egidio Sterpa, [former Milan 
Mayor] Paolo Pillitteri, and [former Budget Minister] Paolo 
Cirino Pomicino. 
  Turning to the one billion lire that was allegedly paid to 
the Italian Communist Party -- the Milan Criminal Court's Second 
Section also found Cusani guilty in relation to this. Borrelli 
said that as yet it is not known to whom the one billion lire 
was physically paid, and no decision has been made for the time 
being. Borrelli stressed `for the time being,' so the 
investigations are continuing.
