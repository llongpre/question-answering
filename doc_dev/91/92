   Choreographer Twyla Tharp, artistic associate of
American Ballet Theater, has some new ballets for the company this
season.
   Instead of slipping them into the repertoire one a week, as
might be expected, the company premiered three with a flourish on
the same night, Saturday, at the Metropolitan Opera House.
   The first, ``Everlast,'' is set in 1919 and tells a story, like
a charming movie of the Keystone Kops era, of a girl, danced by
Susan Jaffe, whose mother decides to marry her off to a boxing
champ, danced by Kevin O'Day, for his money. The girl prefers
dancing with the boys in the chorus.
   A waitress, Anne Adair, falls for the champ and dresses like a
boy to get hired to work with his trainer. A couple of old
busybodies, danced by Shelley Washington and Kathleen Moore,
provide comic relief in an already light-hearted dance. They scoot
in with potted trees in front of them, to spy on the oh-you-kid
goings on and report to the mother, danced by Georgina Parkinson.
   The music is 16 songs by Jerome Kern, chosen for lyrics that
tell the story. Judy Blazer, Jason Graae and Molly Wasserman sang
them, on stage with Michael Dansicker at an upright piano.
   ``Everlast,'' at 40 minutes, is shorter than Fred Astaire movie
musicals because the plot is told by, instead of interrupted by,
the songs and dancing. There is real dancing in ``Everlast,'' as a
solo to ``Left All Alone Again Blues.''
   We very much admire ``Quartet,'' the second New York premiere,
which uses four dancers and a recording by the Kronos Quartet of
Terry Riley music. It's in the tradition of modern-looking,
plotless ballets to modern music like ``Episodes,'' which George
Balanchine choreographed to Webern.
   Alessandra Ferri, Ricardo Bustamente, Susan Jaffe and Jeremy
Collins looked good, often dancing in unison, sometimes one
couple's dancing echoing what the other had just done. Wearing
crisp white shirts and black shorts, they moved constantly but
never seemed frenetic.
   Miss Tharp is known for novelty and ``Bum's Rush,'' which we
liked least of the three, is a novelty ballet, set on a vaudeville
stage. Stagehands dance, so does a baggy-pants comedian. A truck
tire with shapely legs and toe shoes sticking down from it walks
around, gets between a ballerina and her partner or amusingly
collapses on itself.
   Dick Hyman composed music for the half-hour romp. Our favorite
part of it was jazz dancing by two men and our least favorite part
slapstick by three men making animal noises.
   The three dances were premiered earlier this year in San
Francisco, Miami Beach and Chicago, respectively. The evening ended
with an older Twyla Tharp dance, ``In the Upper Room.''
