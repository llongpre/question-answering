   Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of the
American Ballet Theatre for nine years, will step down at the end of
the 1990 season, the company's board of trustees announced Wednesday.
   The board learned Tuesday night of his decision to leave, said
Robert Pontarelli, the company's director of public relations. ``I
would say this is a surprise. It was unexpected,'' he said.
   Baryshnikov, 41, became ABT's artistic director in September
1980. He joined the company in 1974 after defecting from the Soviet
Union, where he danced with the Kirov ballet company.
   ``I will have given 10 years to the company, and it has been a
true challenge,'' he said. ``The dancers in the company are superb.
Of all the responsibilities associated with being artistic director,
I've enjoyed working with the dancers more than anything else.''
   Baryshnikov said he would ``pursue other professional options''
but did not elaborate.
   He is starring on Broadway in ``Metamorphosis,'' a play based on
Franz Kafka's story, and has appeared in such films as ``White
Nights'' and ``The Turning Point.'' He also recently launched a
perfume for women called ``Misha,'' his nickname.
   A search committee will be formed to find a successor, Pontarelli
said.
   Melville Straus, chairman of the board of the Ballet Theatre
Foundation, said in a statement: ``Misha has brought American Ballet
Theatre into a new era and has set a standard of excellence by which
the company will be measured in years to come.''
