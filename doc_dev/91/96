In response to James Jones' column (April 1) lamenting the lack of a classical 
ballet company in Orange County, I would ask anyone with similar concerns the 
following questions: 
</P>
<P>
1. What local ballet company has been performing for Orange County audiences 
for 25 years? 
</P>
<P>
2. What local ballet company performs 80 times a year with full subscriber 
series for both adults and children? 
</P>
<P>
3. What local ballet company did 30 lecture-demonstrations for Orange County 
elementary schools in the last 12 months? 
</P>
<P>
4. What local ballet company has the repertory, scenery, costumes and dancers 
to offer local audiences full productions of "The Nutcracker," "Sleeping 
Beauty," "Copellia," "Firebird" and other classics? 
</P>
<P>
5. What local ballet company was chosen to represent the western states at the 
International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss.? 
</P>
<P>
6. And finally, what Orange County ballet company did the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic ask to dance the pas de deux from "Romeo and Juliet" and a 
variation from "West Side Story" at the Beverly Wiltern last month? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the above questions is, Ballet Pacifica, which is a good example 
of a local dance company that could use support to hire its dancers full-time 
rather than have them come to class and rehearse after working an eight-hour 
day. Like Jones, a lot of us are tired of losing our local talent to ABT, 
Joffrey, San Francisco, and European dance companies. Let's just support and 
build on what we already have -- we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
