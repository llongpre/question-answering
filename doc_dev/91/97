All's quiet on the Joffrey Ballet front. Perhaps more quiet than the local 
dance-going public might care to know. 
</P>
<P>
At last sighting -- May 27 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the closing date 
of a monthlong season -- the Music Center resident ballet company had just come 
through a calamitous near-dismantling, involving the resignation of artistic 
director Gerald Arpino as well as key members of the joint board of directors 
from both New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the bicoastal company danced its spring season's final date, 
all the essentials were back in place. 
</P>
<P>
Except one: Next year's contract at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet's contract with the Music Center expired June 30. It wasn't 
until July 19 that Music Center officials voted to extend it for one year. 
However, the agreement has not yet been signed, according to Sandra Kimberling, 
Music Center Operating Co. president. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as soon as everyone returns from vacation (after Labor Day), we will have 
the signatures," said Brad Brian, vice chairman of the executive committee of 
the Joffrey board in Los Angeles. "We fully expect to be the resident company 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
But the one-year extension, rather than the three-year term awarded the Joffrey 
in 1987, reflects a wait-and-see attitude by funding and booking organizations 
on both coasts. The short-term extension also represents a throwback to 1983-86 
when the Joffrey operated year-to-year at the Music Center without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"That it is just a one-year extension comes as no surprise," said Jim Black, 
vice president of administration and finance at the Music Center. "The company 
needs a chance to reassess its situation and get back on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the "still-evolving changes within the Joffrey organization and 
its fund-raising activities in New York" as elements that need to be considered 
before longer-range negotiations are put on the table. 
</P>
<P>
Brian declined to comment on the one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
"While all parties concur that the upcoming Music Center schedule -- a 
"Nutcracker" season Dec. 19-30 and a spring '91 engagement, May 6 to June 2 -- 
are firm, Black said that the Joffrey's representatives "would like more money 
(from the Music Center), but this is nothing new. Basically, everyone is 
satisfied with the agreement as it's been drafted." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its residency contract with the Music Center, which funds the 
company, the Joffrey also is required to deal with the Music Center Operating 
Co., which books all Pavilion performances. That separate agreement spans a 
three-year term, which, coincidentally expires on June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one wants to acknowledge that the Joffrey's financial health 
determines its residency here, dollars are very much to the point. Box-office 
revenues cannot offset all expenses. Performing arts organizations usually 
operate at a deficit; the question is how large are the deficits. Funding -- 
private as well as public -- make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the Joffrey's troubles in May, the company faced nearly $2 
million in debts. It has now been reduced to $1.3 million, which includes a 
$308,000 federal tax debt and interest on penalties, according to Brian. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary issue just won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
"Each season we see sales in the upper 40%," said Kimberling. She said that the 
percentage "stays largely around there. And of course a record like that is of 
concern. It doesn't indicate growth and it means we must re-examine our 
relationship with the company." 
</P>
<P>
So sensitive an issue is the relatively poor box-office showing that the 
Joffrey, as a Music Center resident company, voted in December to keep American 
Ballet Theatre from signing a contract for annual July engagements at the 
Pavilion, according to Kimberling. 
</P>
<P>
"And they had good reason," she said, even though ABT self-presents and needs 
no guarantees from the house. "The public would be confused being invited to 
fund-raising galas at the Pavilion for two different ballet companies. Which 
one would seem to be the resident? As long as ABT stayed at Shrine Auditorium 
-- and kept a separate identity -- there was no threat." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Joffrey's veto power over other dance companies' appearances 
at the Music Center, ABT canceled its July engagement, substituting London as a 
tour city and bypassing Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But having the Pavilion to itself has not led to the Joffrey's audience 
development. It is commonly acknowledged that a company without a backbone of 
big spectacles like "Swan Lake" or "Giselle" has trouble wooing the mass 
public. And while the Joffrey has added the full-length "Romeo and Juliet" and 
"La Fille de Mal Gardee," dance writers say its identity, as a whole, veers 
away from that of the 19th-Century tutu extravaganzas so popular at the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment no repertory beyond "The Nutcracker" has been announced for the 
Joffrey's U.S. appearances starting this fall. For 11 days in September the 
company performs in Athens and Paris. After that, it begins a series of 
"Nutcracker" engagements: in November at New York City Center, in December in 
Iowa City, Iowa, and at the Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the final work founder Robert Joffrey created before his death in 
1988 turned out to be its most valuable box-office asset. Beyond "The 
Nutcracker," only the dates are listed for a Lincoln Center run at the New York 
State Theater (Feb. 25 to March 17) and elsewhere: Taiwan in January, Hong Kong 
and Singapore in February, Los Angeles again in May and a national tour "to be 
announced."
