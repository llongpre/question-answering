<F P=106> [Interview with Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </F>
Movement by Paolo Borelli in Rome; date not given--recorded; 
Draskovic and Borelli speak in English with voice-over in 
Italian paraphrasing their questions and answers] 
  [Text] Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the opposition in 
Belgrade and therefore the main enemy, at least ideologically, 
of Serb President Milosevic, is paying a visit to Rome. He will 
have meetings with Foreign Minister Andreatta and with Chamber 
of Deputies Speaker Giorgio Napolitano and Senate Speaker 
Giovanni Spadolini. Draskovic will outline his peace plan for 
the former Yugoslavia during his talks with them. Paolo Borelli 
reports: 
  [Borelli] You have opposed the war and Milosevic. Milosevic 
sent you to prison last year. Why is it that this same 
Milosevic is talking to your movement and saying he is ready for 
peace? 
  [Draskovic] Milosevic, like Tudjman, is being forced by the 
facts to make peace. Yes, it is strange that those who started 
the war have now become the champions of peace. But this is not 
the first time this has happened. In Israel, Menachem Begin, 
who had a terrorist, anti-Palestinian guerrilla background, 
received a Nobel prize for peace with Egypt. 
  [Borelli] What will happen when the ultimatum expires on 
Sunday night [20 February]? 
  [Draskovic] The Bosnian Serbs must give up the siege of 
Sarajevo completely. I think they will do so. This means that 
first they have to place all their arms under the control of the 
UN forces in the city and its surrounding area. The second 
step, according to my party's plan, calls for Croats and Muslims 
to place their weapons under UN control also. The third step 
will be the disarming of the three sides and the handing over of 
war criminals for trial. The process of disarmament should be 
carried out by the soldiers of the four powers: the United 
States and British should disarm the Croats and Muslims; Russia 
and the French should disarm the Serbs.
