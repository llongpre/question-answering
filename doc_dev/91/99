<P>
In a departure from tradition, the Orange County Performing Arts Center will 
present for the first time a modern dance company on its 1990-91 dance season. 
</P>
<P>
The Martha Graham Dance Company will make its only Southern California 
appearances, Jan. 4-6, 1991, at the Costa Mesa facility, joining the roster 
that includes the previously announced Australian Ballet, Aug. 7-12; New York 
City Ballet, Sept. 25-30; and American Ballet Theatre, March 12-24, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Graham will be represented by two programs: "Graham, the American," including 
"Appalachian Spring" (music by Copland); and "Classic Graham," including 
"Errand in the Maze." 
</P>
<P>
For its exclusive West Coast engagement, New York City Ballet will lean heavily 
on repertory by founding artistic director George Balanchine, including the 
infrequently toured "Vienna Waltzes." 
</P>
<P>
American Ballet Theatre will offer mixed repertory (to be announced) and either 
Natalia Makarova's staging of "La Bayadere" or a new production of "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the Australian Ballet will dance "Giselle," Lichine's 
"Graduation Ball," Lifar's "Suite en Blanc," and works by Australian and New 
Zealand choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Subscription tickets go on sale May 20. Information: (714) 556-2787.
