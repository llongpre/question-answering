<TEXT>     While Mr. Fender did not invent the electric guitar, he did revolutionize
and perfect it. Called both the Henry Ford and the Thomas Edison of the
instrument, Mr. Fender's solid-body guitars and amplifiers set the industry
standard for excellence.;    "Fender was a phenomenon," said Peter Schuelzky,
general manager of the Guitar Center in Hollywood. "He created the guitar (to)
which all other manufacturers try to conform. . . . Nobody has been quite as
successful.";    Electric guitars made Mr. Fender, a tinkerer and inventor by
nature, a millionaire.;    In 1954, he created the Stratocaster, a
revolutionary instrument hailed as a near-perfect fusion of electronics,
ergonomics and technology on one side, and design and aesthetics on the
other.;    "The Stratocaster is like the Rolls-Royce," said Dick Dale, 53,
known as "king of the surf guitar" for pioneering the surf rock sound in
Southern California in the late-1950s and early '60s. "It can never be
surpassed."  </TEXT>
