   Republican National Commitee Chairman Lee
Atwater says he's ``tickled'' to be invited to appear on NBC's
``Late Night with David Letterman'' and play with the ``World's Most
Dangerous Band.''
   Atwater, a former rock band member, is to appear on the show
Tuesday to play guitar with musical director Paul Shaffer and his
band.
   ``I'm just tickled to play with what I think is one of the
tightest bands in America,'' he said.
   Atwater said the appearance came about through his friendship
with the group's drummer, Anton Fig. He invited Fig to participate
in a rock-and-blues concert he put together as part of the
festivities for President Bush's inauguration. Atwater joined
several blues stars on stage that night, playing electric guitar and
singing a rollicking version of ``High Heeled Sneakers.''
   He has since given numerous interviews about his musical prowess
and played at a local club with guitar superstar B.B. King.
