   Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But
he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations.
   ``It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage
concerts devoted to his music,'' Voss said recently. ``We get the
14-year-olds and the 34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem
to know who Jimi Hendrix was.
   ``There's sort of a gap there _ part of a generation apparently
doesn't realize what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed
today.''
   Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an
unsettling, feedback-laden rendition of the national anthem at the
Woodstock music festival.
   A former music journalist, Voss is founder of the Jimi Hendrix
Information Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum
of the star's memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter
titled ``Voodoo Child,'' a name taken from a Hendrix hit.
   He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the
Seattle-born Hendrix since his drug-related death in a British
ambulance Sept. 18, 1970.
   ``As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20
hours a week on Jimi Hendrix,'' Voss, 38, said in a telephone
interview from his Des Plaines home.
   The newsletter has about 1,500 subscribers, including one fan in
the Soviet Union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such
Hendrix selections as ``Foxy Lady'' and ``Purple Haze.''
   A recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members
of Hendrix's various backup bands and the going prices for Hendrix
memorabilia, ranging from $4 for a mass-printed poster to $4,495
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician.
   ``I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by
Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from
$15,000 to $25,000,'' Voss said.
   ``That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a
Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched
it.''
   Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years. That's
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance,
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar
lying in feedback-shrieking flames.
   ``I don't know how many guitars Jimi destroyed, but I do know
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new
guitars from the pieces,'' Voss said.
   When Voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs, concert halls
and college campuses around the Midwest, he notices many visitors
staring at one exhibit _ a copy of Hendrix' death certificate,
which ends with the words: ``Insufficient evidence of circumstances
_ open verdict.''
   ``Too many people these days only know Hendrix as a `victim' of
drugs, they don't know about his genius as a musician,'' Voss said.
   ``The fact is that although his death was drug-related, Jimi
Hendrix did not die of an overdose. He was not even known among the
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user _ although I
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it
would be now.''
