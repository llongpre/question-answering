   A batch of rock 'n' roll memorabilia featuring
Elvis Presley's underpants and Michael Jackson's stage hat fetched
more than half a million dollars at auction Saturday.
   A lot of Presley's personal items, including a pair of
Munsingwear maroon nylon underpants, an electric razor, hairbrush
and black socks, went for $605, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's, the auctioneer.
   A Gibson model J-200 guitar Presley used in the late 1950s and
early '60s sold for $27,500, the top price paid at the auction, Ms.
Stewart said.
   Jackson's autographed fedora was sold for $4,125.
   About 30 bidders and more than 300 spectators gathered to see
226 lots of memorabilia sold for a total of $533,477, Ms. Stewart
said. The T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS
Research received $127,600 of the proceeds, she said.
   Top-priced items included a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
used by Jimi Hendrix that sold for $15,400; Hendrix's silk Neru
jacket with handpainted eyes, face and other psychedelic details
that went for $13,200, and a gold ring of Presley's that attracted
a top bid of $14,300, she said.
   The Elvis Presley Museum in Nashville spent $9,900 for an
autographed bustier worn by Madonna in her music video for ``Gonna
Dress You Up In My Love,'' she said.
   Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics for ``I Want You'' went for
$8,800, a John Lennon gray wool suit fetched $3,300 and one of
Lennon's guitar straps sold for $8,250, she said.
   A pair of high-top white and gray leather sneakers autographed
by Jam Master J and Joseph ``Run'' Simmons of Run DMC sold for
$1,870, she said.
   The sneakers, which brought four times the projected price, were
purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe of New York.
   Hard Rock America, which stocks its 10 restaurants with rock
memorabilia, paid $137,973 for 49 lots, Ms. Stewart said.
   Other items auctioned included a group of Avalon Ballroom
concert posters featuring groups such as Canned Heat, Iron
Butterfly, The Doors and Jefferson Airplane that went for $3,850,
and a set of Huey Lewis' golf clubs that sold for $2,475, Ms.
Stewart said.
