Frank Zappa, the guitarist and composer, has died in Los Angeles, aged 52,
from prostate cancer. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he grew up in southern
California, attending the same high school as Captain Beefheart, aka Don Van
Vliet. His musical career began, legend has it, through a need to pay fines
for his involvement in making porn films. For the record, he began by
co-writing low-budget Western film scores with Beefheart while playing white
soul music in bars. By the mid-1960s Zappa's prodigious talent for the
electric guitar, lyrical innuendo and compositional energy was recognised
and the first of some of 70 disparate albums was recorded.
With his everchanging band, The Mothers of Invention, and records with
titles like 'Burnt Weeny Sandwich', Zappa's crazed collage of jazz
improvisation, doo-wop and fierce electric guitar rock heroics made him an
underground hero. In 1970, increasing interest in major compositional works
brought about the first of many classical collaborations, 200 Motels with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later joint ventures included three volumes
with the London Symphony Orchestra baroque trio recording of the music of
Francesco Zappa (circa 1763) and, most importantly, 'The Perfect Stranger'
with Pierre Boulez and his ensemble Intercontemporain.
But it is the slickly produced and cruelly executed misanthropic rock
anthems of the 1970s and '80s for which Zappa is chiefly remembered: songs
populated by perverts ('The Detroit Enema Bandit') and Middle American
obsessions ('Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk'), with lyrics intoned by a deadpan
Zappa and terrifying solos delivered by stunt sidemen in beautifully
arranged composition.
As well as these scabrous musical observations, he will also be remembered
for a contrary code of ethics which brought him simultaneously into conflict
with the US establishment (over censorship), with hippiedom (over his
contempt for drug culture), and with Cold War eastern bloc governments (over
his funding of alternative art there).
Zappa is survived by his son Dweezil and daughter Moon Unit, who are both
rock musicians.
