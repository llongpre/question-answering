The diversity of California was the made-to-order theme of the latest Green 
Umbrella program Monday night at Japan America Theatre. David Alan Miller 
conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group in premieres by three 
very different composers, all with at least a remote connection to the Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast premiere of David Lang's "Are You Experienced?" (1987) for 
narrator, amplified tuba and chamber orchestra with synthesizer and electric 
guitar proved the most ambitious undertaking. Titled after the first album of 
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, these six movements -- four with texts -- confuse 
and disorient both intentionally and unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
The listener anticipates references to Hendrix's music, but none occur -- save 
a short humorous episode where the amplified tuba is used to manipulate 
feedback from an amplifier. The text proceeds with a deadpan monologue about 
being on the verge of unconsciousness after a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Lang read his texts mixing the monotone narrative styles of William Burroughs 
and Laurie Anderson, but humor and shock value faded quickly, as did interest. 
Meanwhile, an otherwise inventive style of composition with single-note 
repetitions and carefully structured rhythms relentlessly pulsated and at times 
loudly banged. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a wild electronic solo in the "Dance" movement, Jay 
Rozen's tuba-playing went largely unnoticed. Conductor Miller's apt attention 
to the score yielded an accurate, polished reading. 
</P>
<P>
Another West Coast premiere, Steven Stucky's modest "Sappho Fragments" (1982) 
-- a setting of five short text fragments attributed to Sappho for soprano and 
small chamber ensemble -- proceeded with conservative, carefully wrought 
instrumental materials. Here, Stucky used additive processes common to the 
Minimalist school in a way consistent with his own mainstream, atonal style. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Jennifer Trost convincingly conveyed the demanding vocal part, singing 
in both the original Greek and an English translation. Again, Miller led his 
forces admirably. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. premiere of Finlander Kaija Saariaho's "Lichtbogen"(1985-86) for 
flute, electronics and chamber ensemble, demonstrated an intelligent use of 
microtonal passages and sonorities in a Ligeti-inspired sonic portrayal of an 
arctic landscape. GREGG WAGER
