<HEAD>Julian Bream Guitar Makes Record Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of
English classical guitarist Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100,
a world auction record for the instrument, Sotheby's said.
   The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday
by a Japanese dealer whose name was not available. The previous
record was $18,900, paid in 1974 for a south German guitar made in
1624.
   Acoustic guitars are the traditional models of the instrument
and they tend to wear out fairly quickly when used.
   Bream has said he plays his guitars for two years and then likes
to sell them for others to play.
   Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far
more money: one owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for
$322,000.
   The record guitar and five others sold by Bream Thursday brought
in a total of $56,100.
