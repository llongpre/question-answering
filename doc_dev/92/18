   Life imitated art at an auction Saturday when
actor Gary Busey, who played Buddy Holly in a film biography, paid
$242,000 for an acoustic guitar owned by the late rock 'n' roll
pioneer.
   In addition to the 1945 Gibson guitar with a cover hand-tooled
by Holly himself, the 118 lots in the Holly sale included a Fender
Stratocaster guitar which netted $110,000 and a pair of the
rocker's trademark black-rimmed glasses which went for $45,100.
   The sale brought in a total of $703,615, said Laura Stewart,
spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction house.
   The proceeds will go to Holly's family, including his widow,
Maria Elena Holly, and his brother, Larry Holley of Lubbock, Texas,
Stewart said. The two were among the 200 people attending the
auction.
   Busey, who bid by telephone, was widely acclaimed for his 1978
portrayal of the bespectacled rocker in ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
His winning bid was more than six times the pre-sale estimate of
$35,000.
   The acoustic guitar, covered with four-color leather, has the
words ``Buddy Holly,'' ``Love Me'' and ``Blue Days, Black Nights''
hand-tooled across the top and ``Texas'' hand-tooled across the
bottom.
   Holly's Stratocaster electric guitar attracted nearly double its
pre-sale estimate of $60,000, and was purchased by an unidentified
bidder. Holly was playing the guitar on the ill-fated tour which
ended with his death.
   The black-rimmed glasses, which Holly wore at the end of his
career, sold for $45,100 to the Hard Rock Cafe, Stewart said. The
late John Lennon, another rocker who wore glasses, once said of
Holly's shades, ``He made it O.K. to wear glasses. I was Buddy
Holly.''
   Another prominent buyer _ Pat DiNizio, lead singer of the
Smithereens _ paid $14,300 for a reel-to-reel tape recorder and
microphone which Holly used to compose new songs.
   Holly burst into prominence in 1957, reeling off a string of
hits like ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``That'll Be The Day,''
``Maybe Baby,'' and ``Not Fade Away.'' Holly, along with J.P. ``The
Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens, died in a Feb. 3, 1959,
plane crash when he was 23.
   ``This memorabilia from the personal collection of Buddy Holly
provides a fascinating glimpse of the singer's boyhood and brief
years of stardom,'' Sotheby's said in its auction catalogue.
   The items date back to when Holly was 11 years old. Included
were family photographs, Holly's harmonica and camera, a business
card from his first band ``Buddy &amp; Bob,'' his personal collection
of 45s and home movies from Christmas 1958.
   There was also one particularly eerie item: a 1956 Equitable
Life insurance policy on Holly, with his parents named as
beneficiaries. This included a handwritten receipt signed by Holly.
