A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of English classical guitarist 
Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100, a world auction record for the 
instrument, Sotheby's said.

The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday by a Japanese 
dealer whose name was not available. The previous record was $18,900 paid in 
1974 for a south German guitar made in 1624. Bream has said he plays his 
guitars for two years and then likes to sell them for others to play.

Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far more money. One 
owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for $322,000.
