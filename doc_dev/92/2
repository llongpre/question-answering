<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of Clarence Leo Fender, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley and Little
Richard, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a Fullerton resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable Les Paul, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the 1940s (eventually manufactured by Fender's
American arch-rival, the Gibson Corp.). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the 1930s, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
Levi's and Coca-Cola, the Stratocaster and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from New York to South Korea. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    Tom Wheeler, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as Sputnik, or as tacky
as all the sequins in Webb Pierce's wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   Fender's creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Eric Clapton became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards and Danny
Gatton) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, Fender was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in 1951 -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; Telecasters had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or Stevie Ray Vaughan-like blues or the B.B. King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "Michael, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting Jericho's
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under $200 in the 1950s and
early 1960s suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, 1957,
Sunburst, Been Through Hell. $5,000" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in Japan. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the United
States.;    Fender himself, the man Wheeler calls the "Henry Ford of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded G &amp; L Musical Products, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, Fender was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>
