Like an exhibition of an artist's preliminary pencil sketches, a solo acoustic 
concert by a rocker who normally operates with a full band can give beholders a 
glimpse of pared-down essences, of the initial, unadorned vision behind the 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Tom Verlaine's solo show Tuesday night at the Coach House was 
that the painterly analogy didn't always apply. Without a band and without 
electricity, a good deal of Verlaine's essence got lost. 
</P>
<P>
In much of his work, Verlaine is more like a master builder than a painter. 
Ever since he emerged in the 1970s as the leader of Television, Verlaine has 
been one of rock's most inventive guitar architects. His two albums with 
Television, and six subsequent solo albums (including the fine new import-only 
release, "The Wonder") all stand as excellent examples of the expressive 
capability of rock guitar. But take away Verlaine's ability to weave meaning 
through layered guitar structures and electric solo excursions, and you remove 
a large part of his work's essence. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional rock songwriters can strip their music down to voice and acoustic 
guitar and still have a miniature version of a whole -- a fairly comprehensive 
acoustic sketch of the full-color portrait they normally create with a band. 
For Verlaine, lyrics are often abstract and oblique -- offering sufficient 
clues to meanings, but not the whole story. It's left to his guitars and 
keyboard textures to shade meanings and to express the most intense emotions. 
</P>
<P>
While Verlaine made good use of dynamic shifts and well-placed pauses in his 
solo acoustic guitar accompaniments, he essentially stuck to basic chording and 
brief fills that hardly carried the expressive weight of his electric guitar 
work. The solo spotlight didn't flatter his limited voice, either. 
</P>
<P>
And with a dry, detached bearing that was as coolly mellow as a graveyard-shift 
disc jockey's, the gaunt, close-cropped singer wasn't about to win over an 
audience with chatty charm and self-revelation -- a favorite tactic of veteran 
solo acoustic performers (listeners who had come to hear opening singer Shawn 
Colvin -- apparently the majority of the small audience -- were hardly won 
over. Most of them exited early in Verlaine's 70-minute show, leaving only 50 
or so partisans to hear out his entire set). 
</P>
<P>
Unruffled by the early departures (a small audience is something this 
influential but underappreciated underground rock hero must be inured to by 
now), Verlaine sang with commitment and intensity throughout his show. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off on songs that followed more conventional narrative lines -- notably 
"Words From the Front," a straightforward monologue describing a foot soldier's 
fears on the eve of battle. Verlaine brought the character to life, his voice 
rising and cracking at the end to convey the anguish and bitterness beneath a 
stoical surface. 
</P>
<P>
The solo setting did help Verlaine underscore the humor in songs like the sexy 
"Kaleidescope" and "The Man in the Back Yard," an unrecorded number that took a 
furtive, bluesy cast. The oddity of the evening was Verlaine's concluding dip 
into country myth -- first with a direct enough rendering of Willie Nelson's 
"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain," then a convoluted medley of Johnny Cash's "Ring 
of Fire" and "I Walk the Line," which Verlaine embellished with a deadpan tale 
about Cash having an encounter with the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of straightforward, silver-voiced solo acoustic performance got it from 
Colvin. The small, sharp-featured singer sounded far more forceful on her own 
than she does on her debut album, which suffers from a too-clean, too-cool 
production job by a team of Suzanne Vega's cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
Colvin's songs tend toward introspection that is deeply felt, but too 
conventionally expressed. Live, this strong, confident singer gave the best of 
her songs extra presence and grit, and rounded out her 70-minute set with 
well-chosen, well-executed covers that included songs by the Band, Richard 
Thompson, Talking Heads and, in a nice, light surprise, the Foundations' "Baby, 
Now That I've Found You."

acoustic show by guitarist Tom Verlaine at the Coach House was at its best when 
the music was at its most narrative, but it lacked the range and power of his 
electric sound, Mike Boehm says.
