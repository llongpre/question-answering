   Danny Ransom spent the first six months of
his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for $10 each.
   Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of
art, that sell for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that
includes some of the world's best-known musicians.
   The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one
guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a
craftsman such as Ransom spends several days, sometimes weeks, on a
single instrument.
   ``These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, `We
build the most perfect machine in the world,' and most of their
stuff is junk,'' he says. ``I've had to make sure every instrument
is right.''
   Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-building business 13 years. He
has built guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and
Alabama. Laurie Anderson and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer
violins he made for a company called Zeta.
   Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's
Stratocaster-style guitars last year from a friend. He says Ransom
understands the complexities of the instrument and how the different
parts interact.
   ``He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most
guitar makers,'' Kaiser said. ``It's just a versatile, expressive
instrument.''
   An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-filled
studio adjacent to ``Real Guitars,'' a collector's guitar store.
   There was a time when he was low man on the guitar-maker totem
pole. He first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now
defunct, initially building what he calls ``the worst garbage.''
   Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff builders had a
habit of taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) on the job and
``talking to the tools.''
   ``The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was
brought in,'' Ransom recalls. ``They stuck me in a room with a bunch
of tools, handed me a guitar and said, `Make these.'''
   His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping
$10 each. They were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out.
   One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first
time he'd completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The
final touches required a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided
to show him how it was done.
   ``At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals
burning on it,'' Ransom recalls. ``I said, `Do you know what you're
doing?' He said, `Shut up, of course I do.' Then the glue line
started to lift off and the thing burst into flames right in front
of us.
   ``If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. ...
This is like watching your child burn.''
   Things started to pick up after other builders began teaching
him. Ransom says the difference between a good guitar and a bad
guitar lies in the details, such as the curves in the wood and
placement of the finger board and joints.
   ``There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail.
The better you can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get
at whatever you do in terms of craft. That's really what I got from
some of the people who helped me early on.''
   His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made
mostly from alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards
armed with density and moisture meters to find the right wood. Soft
woods, such as mahogony, tend to give off more mid-range sound while
harder woods, such as poplar, produce the higher, treble sounds. He
has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash
from Louisiana.
   Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, bandsaws
them out, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on
a pinrouter. Last, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows
and bellys are cut by hand.
   As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s,
Ransom had planned to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his
experience working with wood was building matchstick holders and
other ``goofy little things'' when he was a Cub Scout.
   Although he is an admitted `Deadhead' _ Grateful Dead fan _
Ransom is not much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset
than a liability for an electric guitar and violin maker.
   ``The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but
aren't players tend to be much more versatile in their building and
are much more involved in the quality of their instrument, not just
the sound or the playability, but the overall quality.''
