Danny Ransom spent the first six months of his career tediously making deformed 
electric guitars for $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of art, that sell 
for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that includes some of the world's 
best-known musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one guitar body and a 
dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a craftsman like Ransom spends 
several days, sometimes weeks, on a single instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, 'We build the most 
perfect machine in the world,' and most of their stuff is junk," Ransom said. 
"I've had to make sure every instrument is right." 
</P>
<P>
Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-making business 13 years. He has made 
guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and Alabama. Laurie Anderson 
and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer violins he made for a company called 
Zeta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understands Complexities 
</P>
<P>
Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's Stratocaster-style 
guitars last year from a friend. He said Ransom understands the complexities of 
the instrument and how the different parts interact. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most guitar makers," 
Kaiser said. "It's just a versatile, expressive instrument." 
</P>
<P>
An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-strewn studio adjacent 
to "Real Guitars," a collector's guitar store in the city's South of Market 
district. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Ransom was low man on the guitar-maker totem pole. He 
first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now defunct, initially 
making what he calls "the worst garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff workers had a habit of taking 
LSD on the job and "talking to the tools." 
</P>
<P>
"The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was brought in," 
Ransom recalled. "They stuck me in a room with a bunch of tools, handed me a 
guitar and said, 'Make these.' " 
</P>
<P>
His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping $10 each. They 
were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bursts Into Flames 
</P>
<P>
One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first time he had 
completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The final touches required 
a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided to show him how it was done. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals burning on it," 
Ransom said. "I said, 'Do you know what you're doing?' He said, 'Shut up, of 
course I do.' Then the glue line started to lift off and the thing burst into 
flames right in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. . . . This is like 
watching your child burn." 
</P>
<P>
Things started to pick up after other workers began teaching him. Ransom said 
the difference between a good guitar and a bad guitar lies in the details, such 
as the curves in the wood and placement of the finger board and joints. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail. The better you 
can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get at whatever you do in 
terms of craft. That's really what I got from some of the people who helped me 
early on." 
</P>
<P>
His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made mostly of 
alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards, armed with density and 
moisture meters, to find the right wood. Soft woods, such as mahogony, tend to 
give off more mid-range sound while harder woods, such as poplar, produce the 
higher, treble sounds. 
</P>
<P>
He has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash from 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, cuts them out on a 
bandsaw, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on a pin 
router. Finally, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows and bellys 
are cut by hand. 
</P>
<P>
As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s, Ransom had planned 
to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his experience working with wood was 
in making matchstick holders and other "goofy little things" when he was a Cub 
Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is an admitted "Deadhead" -- Grateful Dead fan -- Ransom is not 
much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset than a liability for a 
maker of electric guitars and violins. 
</P>
<P>
"The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but aren't players tend 
to be much more versatile in their building and are much more involved in the 
quality of their instrument, not just the sound or the playability, but the 
overall quality."
