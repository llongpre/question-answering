Through his early work with drummer Chico Hamilton, jazz-rock group Free 
Spirits and vibist Gary Burton, Texas-born guitarist Larry Coryell emerged as 
one of the most original improvisers in jazz during the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
At the Catalina Bar and Grill on Tuesday night, Coryell, who has consistently 
been at odds with the predictable during his eclectic career, offered a 
distortion-free set of standards that verily swung from note one. 
</P>
<P>
"The intimacy of the club demands standards," the 46-year-old guitarist said 
after his opening set. "I mean, you can't play rock 'n' roll in here." 
</P>
<P>
Though smiling at the observation by his son, Julian, that he "got pretty 
raunchy" during a closing blues, Coryell nonetheless seemed pleased with having 
spent the previous hour exploring the vagaries of jazz -- that music closest to 
his rock-loving soul. 
</P>
<P>
Admiring as he might be of Jimi Hendrix's artistry and Eric Clapton's 
musicality, Coryell found sufficient expression in the tradition of John 
Coltrane's "Moment's Notice," an opening number that fairly bristled with 
boppish excitement. A unique blend of strummed chords and plucked lines showed 
Coryell to be a player of virtuosic technique with a deep sense of melodic 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
That same musicality was evident in "All the Things You Are" and the bop 
classic "Just Friends." In both cases, bassist Brian Torff and drummer Cindy 
Blackman lent substantiative rhythmic support, with Torff offering splendid 
solo outings on his Banchetti electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Stanley Cowell had ample solo opportunities and showed himself to be a 
marvelously supportive player throughout the opening set. As a composer, his 
"Equipoise" was a beautiful offering that evolved neatly from its ballad 
beginnings to a Latin-tinged cooker. 
</P>
<P>
Coryell's solo offering of the evening was an enthusiastic reading of George 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." In it, the guitarist, who works the Hollywood 
nightery through Sunday, displayed the multiple musical influences -- jazz, 
rock, Latin -- that have created his unique musical identity. A. JAMES LISKA
