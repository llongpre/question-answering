   Meet the new Who, a little older, grayer and
quieter, but still able to deliver the goods with a punch.
   Before a packed house Tuesday night at Radio City Music Hall, the
Who played virtually its entire 1969 ``Tommy'' rock opera in a
benefit for autistic and abused children.
   It was a different Who, however, with a muted Pete Townshend
mostly playing acoustic guitar because of severe hearing problems
from years of playing loud electric guitar. He had help on lead
guitar from Steve Bolton, who added a 1980s flavor to the band's
'60s standards.
   John Entwistle's superb bass at times seemed to overpower the
other band members, but there was added support from a five-member
horn section, three backup singers, drummer Simon Phillips and
percussionist Jodi Linscott. Roger Daltrey and Towshend were both in
fine voice.
   The Who raced through an hour-long, uninterrupted ``Tommy,''
bringing the audience to its feet with ``Pinball Wizard,'' ``I'm
Free'' and ``We're Not Gonna Take It.''
   Townshend, who wrote ``Tommy,'' went through as many guitars as
he did in the old days, but this time they all went off stage in one
piece. One of Daltrey's two tamborines was the only casualty.
   The rock opera, with its muddled story line about a deaf, dumb
and blind kid who's cured and becomes a rock celebrity, was first
performed in London in 1969. It was made into a movie by Ken Russell
in 1975, starring Daltrey, Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton,
Keith Moon and Elton John as the Pinball Wizard. The Royal Canadian
Ballet did its own version and the London Symphony Orchestra did a
recording.
   ``Tommy'' has a rather mystical quality with its songs about
pinball, mobs and spiritualism.
   Townshend once joked about ``Tommy,'' saying rock critics and
many fans took it seriously but that it was really just light
entertainment.
   After performing ``Tommy,'' the band returned for an encore,
which also lasted an hour. Townshend picked up an electric guitar
for ``Can't Explain.'' And the Who had the audience on its feet
again, clapping and singing along to such Who classics as ``Behind
Blue Eyes,'' ``Love, Rein O'er Me'' and a sizzling ``Won't Get
Fooled Again.''
   The Who plans one other performance of ``Tommy,'' in Los Angeles
on Aug. 24.
