FLECKTONES: MORE HIP THAN HAYSEED

Bluegrass it ain't. Despite the twang of strings and the whine of a harmonica, 
banjo-picking Bela Fleck and his trio, the Flecktones, come up with something 
more urban than country, more hip than hayseed. 
</P>
<P>
Their music is what the Mahavishnu Orchestra might have sounded like if it had 
been led by Earl Scruggs rather than John McLaughlin. 
</P>

The group's long show Monday at the Roxy, consisting mainly of Fleck originals 
pulled from his latest Warner Bros. recording, fused a number of influences and 
technologies with some solid musicianship into what aficionados call "new 
grass." Fleck puts the emphasis on the "new." 
</P>
<P>
Each band member contributed some kind of innovation, even if some were more 
technological than musical. Fleck, who also played acoustic five-string during 
the show, opened on a banjo whose familiar circular soundtable was encased in a 
Fender-style electric guitar body. Even percussionist Roy Wooten, sans traps, 
played a "Drumitar," a drum machine with large pastel buttons that has a neck 
like a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also invention of the musical sort. By bending notes with 
pin-point precision, harmonica-man Howard Levy, who often worked his mouth 
organ with one hand while playing electric keyboard with the other, pulled the 
full chromatic scale from his simple blues harp. Bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten 
(Roy's brother) has adapted the two-handed "tap" technique of guitarist Stanley 
Jordan to his instrument, fingering the neck of his bass as if it were a 
keyboard. During an unaccompanied solo he played the melody of "Chopsticks" and 
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies" in the upper register while providing his own 
bass line.

<P>
Fleck showed some slick chording during his own "Sunset Road," and put in some 
appropriately stormy dissonance during an uptempo "Hurricane Camille."
