<LEADPARA>  GUITARIST Steven Mackey had a dream. A rather peculiar dream, but a dream
nonetheless.;    "When I heard a string quartet for the first time," Mackey
has written, "I knew that someday I would write a piece combining that
ensemble with the electric guitar."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They do go together like Beethoven and Chuck Berry, after all.;    Mackey
has written his piece, and he and the Kronos Quartet will perform it Saturday
at Stanford.;    If any quartet were going to add an electric guitar to the
lineup, it would be Kronos. Since its founding in 1973, the San
Francisco-based Kronos has developed a reputation for its innovative -- some
might say downright odd -- repertoire.;    You haven't heard anything until
you've heard Kronos' version of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze." Of course, that
one they play without electric guitar.;    More often, though, Kronos plays a
variety of new music and unusual arrangements of classical music, including
works of Bartok, Ives, Charles Mingus, John Cage and Howlin' Wolf.;    On
Saturday, Kronos will give Mackey's "Fables with Three Tasks" its world
premiere. Mackey has written several other works for the quartet and has
arranged blues tunes for Kronos.;    The Kronos Quartet and Steven Mackey
perform at 8 p.m. Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at Stanford. Tickets are
$20-$22 with $3 off for students. Call the Tresidder Ticket Office, (415)
725-2787.; Ballet? In Akron?; Heinz Poll had a dream, too. A rather peculiar
dream, but a dream nonetheless.;    He wanted to start a ballet company -- in
Akron, Ohio.;    That was in 1968, and since then the Ohio Ballet has
performed in 176 cities and 36 states. The company makes it 177 on Friday and
Saturday, as it performs at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts.;
   Artistic director Poll is also the company's principal choreographer and
has created about two-thirds of the pieces now performed by the Ohio Ballet.; 
  He's also been active in building the ballet's reputation. The 20-member
company has performed at the Spoleto Festival, both Italian and American
versions, the New York Dance Festival and the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.; 
  In Mountain View tonight, the company performs works choreographed by Poll
and also by George Balanchine and Laura Dean, then on Saturday night, works by
Paul Taylor.;    The ballet performs at 8 p.m. today and Saturday on the
MainStage at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts, at Castro and
Mercy streets. Tickets are $18-$22 at the center's ticket office, (415)
903-6000.; An evening of gospel;  Foothill College celebrates African-American
heritage month Saturday with what's become an annual evening of gospel music.;
   Two winners in the McDonald's 1990 Gospel Festival, the San Jose Youth and
Young Adult Choir and Revelation (formerly called the Bay Area District
Choir), will join the Foothill College Gospel Chorus and the Foothill Fanfairs
in the college's Main Theatre at 7 p.m. Saturday.;    Also performing are the
Gospel Chimes Quartet, Heirs to the Throne, New Sweet Home Choir and the
Emmanuel Baptist Church Adult Choir.;    Tickets at the door are $8; $5 for
students and seniors. Proceeds will fund scholarships at Foothill. The college
is at 12345 El Monte Road, Los Altos Hills.; In performance; (box) Sundara
Swaminathan, an Indian classical dancer and choreographer, will perform at 6
p.m. Saturday in the Cubberley Theater, 4000 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto.
Tickets are $5, and children under age 10 will be admitted free.  </TEXT>
