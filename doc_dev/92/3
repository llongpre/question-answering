<TEXT>     The death appeared to be from natural causes, Maynard said.;    Mr. Fender
had suffered from Parkinson's disease for decades but continued to work on
guitar designs at his shop.;    With its candy-colored curves, the
Stratocaster revolutionized music by making mass-produced electric guitars
that were affordable and had great sound.;    "He definitely was a pioneer.
It's still probably the No. 1 selling guitar in the world," said John
Carruthers, a guitar maker in Los Angeles who used to be a consultant to Mr.
Fender. "He was the Henry Ford of electric guitars. He basically turned it
into an assembly-line situation."  </TEXT>
