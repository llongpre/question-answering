<LEADPARA>  WITH a quarter-century of playing behind them, few groups have remained intact
as long as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.;    Or worked so hard for so little
acclaim.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Their show Tuesday night at Paul Masson Mountain Winery was testimony to
the long-lived appeal of the band's good-timey sound, but also solid proof of
its limitations.;    Their 1972 breakthrough album, "Will the Circle Be
Unbroken," was inspired and brave. During the polarized Vietnam era, five
hippies from Southern California joined ranks with relative oldsters from
Nashville to record a superb live, three-album set.;    From there they went
on to a style that blended folk and country into a light pop mix, the stuff
that 15 years ago you hummed along with on the AM stations, then probably
forgot. Next came their equally airy country rock.;    When they gathered the
new Nashville forces for the "Circle" segue, released in 1989, the album won
three Grammys and Country Music Association album of the year. But NGDB's main
role seemed to be more as facilitator than as musicians.;    So it was little
surprise that Tuesday's show included only one song off that award-winning
album (Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"). Instead, almost the entire
70-minute, 16-song set was composed of songs from the latest of their several
"best of" albums, "Live Two Five.";    They opened with an almost-embarrassing
25th-birthday song to themselves, referring to each other by name and singing
"It's great to be part of something so good that's lasted so long." Gee,
thanks for convincing us.;    Even less convincing were the contrived and
choreographed boy-bonding antics of guitarist Jeff Hannah and Jimmy Ibbotson
-- mugging for the elaborate video camera setup, shuffling in unison across
the stage, warm smiles at each other as if to say, "Can you BELIEVE we're
still having this much fun?" My answer would have been no, not when you have
to work so hard at it.;    But founding member Hannah and bass-guitar-mandolin
player Ibbotson capably handled the lead vocals, with occasional lead vocals
by keyboardist Bob Carpenter. Jimmy Fadden played the drums and harmonica
simultaneously, which is somewhat of an impressive feat.;    After running
through such feel-good light fare as "Stand a Little Rain," "Dance Little
Jean," "Fishin' in the Dark," "Baby's Got a Hold on Me" and, of course, "Mr.
Bojangles," they honored the clamor for an encore with "Will the Circle Be
Unbroken.";    So it was a bit of irony that opening for NGBD was one of the
hottest, hard-driving bands around these days, the Texas Tornadoes.;    Led by
Freddie Fender, he of "Wasted Days, Wasted Nights" and "A Man Can Cry," the
Tornadoes include Augie Meyers and Doug Sahm of the "Sir Douglas Quintet" and
Flaco Jimenez, undisputed king of Tex-Mex accordion.;    The Tornadoes mixed
torrid border rock 'n' roll ("Adios, Mexico") with Fender's tender ballads
("Till the Last Teardrop Falls," "Tell It Like It Is") and Sahm's '60s
pop/rock hits ("Mendocino," "She's About a Mover").;    This music and these
guys, who've been playing for more than 30 years, are as real as it gets. Sahm
plays his 25-year-old Voss electric guitar with the peeling paint and cracked
varnish and his beautiful inlaid bajo sexto with equal agility.;    And Fender
does "Last Teardrop" as if he's been living that ache every day of his life
since he first sang it.;    A too-short hour set included such highlights as
keyboardist Meyers picking up the concertina for a rollicking, smoking duet
with Jiminez's accordion on Meyer's often-covered "Hey Baby, Que Paso" and a
full-on electric guitar blowout on Sahm's "Mendocino.";    All this topped off
by a Tex-Mex burner of a medley, Doug Sahm doing a subtle Mick Jagger strut to
"96 Tears" that segued into "Wooly Bully.";    Which gets us back to the irony
factor: NGDB's Hannah mentioned that, way back in the '60s, the band had
opened for Sahm's quintet.;    Sometimes, things make better sense left the
way they were.  </TEXT>
