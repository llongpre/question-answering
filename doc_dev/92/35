<LEADPARA>  IF THE electric guitar could be considered a vehicle for artistic expression,
Eric Johnson could rightfully be called the Chuck Yeager of all guitardom. The
Austin, Texas, virtuoso has devoted his career to proving just how far a
vintage Fender Strat and a Marshall amp will go -- without most of the digital
doodads of the '90s.;    "To me, it's a challenge to make the guitar an
interesting, intelligent instrument," Johnson said, in a phone call this week
from a Redding motel. (Johnson and his four-piece band are halfway through a
circuitous West Coast tour that will bring them to San Jose State University's
Event Center tonight.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's sort of a yard tool, like something you dug out of a shed, ya know?
There's a real dichotomy of elegance and rawness there -- and to take this
thing that some people perceive to be a crude implement and craft something
delicate and beautiful with it . . . it's very rewarding," he said.;   
Johnson is a player's player. When other guitarists get to talking about pure
skill and musicianship, the name that comes up with increasing frequency is
his. Last year, the readers of Guitar Player magazine voted him "best overall
guitarist." It was the latest in a string of Guitar Player awards that began
in '86, when he was named "best new guitarist.";    Lately, Johnson is also
earning accolades far beyond the tight ranks of his fellow players. In
February, his current album, "Ah Via Musicom," was nominated for a Grammy in
the "best rock instrumental performance" category. It was the second Grammy
nomination in two albums' time.;    While the 36-year-old hotshot may still
look like an 18-year-old Tom Petty, his career dates back to the early '70s,
when he worked with a local Austin group called Mariani. "I did other things a
couple of times -- cleaned office buildings and was even a carpenter for two
days. But by the time I was 19, this was my true profession," he said.;   
"There was a period around 1980 when I got out of the whole scene for a couple
years. I was just very disillusioned with the process of getting my music
heard. It was Guitar Player's support and the 'Austin City Limits'
(television) show in '84 that really turned my career around. I'd just been
turned down by every major label in the country. And after the show aired . .
. it was like night and day.";    Johnson was signed to Reprise in '85. The
next year, his debut album, "Tones," was nominated for a Grammy in the "best
rock instrumental" category.;    After Reprise decided not to exercise an
option for a second album, Johnson eventually signed with Cinema Records, a
small label expressly designed to market new acts to consumers who had tuned
out of rock when the "progressive" rock genre of the mid-'70s waned. Cinema
chief Denny Somach was looking for new faces to appeal to the 25- to
49-year-old crowd who grew up on groups such as Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes.
Cinema eventually became an in-house production company for giant Capitol
Records.;    After more than a year of work, Johnson's Capitol debut, "Ah Via
Musicom," hit the stores in March 1990. Amazingly, the self-produced, mostly
instrumental disc got heavy airplay on mainstream album-oriented rock outlets.
Although Capitol promotions staffers offered instrumental tracks from
"Musicom" to "new age" radio, they say few stations have added the songs so
far.;    Over the course of just two albums, Johnson has earned a reputation
as something of an obsessive character in the studio. When it comes to his
quest for the perfect, pure tone, no amount of time is too much, and no detail
is too small.;    Johnson said he decided to produce "Musicom" himself rather
than go with a more experienced producer, because he had a very specific
vision of what he wanted: "There's an entire range of producers -- from people
who insist on total control to those who just accommodate whatever an artist
wants. I wanted to do a record where I could push myself to that arena of
perfection. It's like an artist painting a picture -- some want to make each
stroke themselves; others want another hand to steady the brush. There's
nothing wrong with either way.";    Johnson said his next album, which he's
writing now, will include a sharp turn toward a more spontaneous, live sound.
For a player-producer known for demanding near-surgical precision in the
studio, it represents a tremendous leap of faith. "I'd like to experiment with
capturing the spontaneous energy of shows. It's possible we'll even cut half
of the album live in the studio (recording parts simultaneously rather than
sequentially). I have a lot of respect for classical players who can go in and
just do spontaneously -- and do it right -- because their technique is so
perfect.";    Eric Johnson; Where: San Jose State University Event Center,
