   The guitar company that made instruments
for stars from Elvis Presley to Johnny Cash has been sold to a
Wisconsin company after two months of bankruptcy proceedings.
   Randall Corp., which makes electronic amplifiers, hopes to expand
its product line with the purchase of Guild Guitar Corp., said
Patricia Meyer, marketing services manager.
   The Wisconsin company paid $2.1 million for Guild at a
court-ordered auction on Tuesday, Meyer said. A U.S. bankruptcy
judge approved the transaction.
   Guild filed for Chapter 11 protection in November after losing
about $30,000 a month for several years, said court-appointed
trustee Michael Weingarten.
   The company will continue to operate its Westerly factory, which
makes about 25 guitars a day, a union official said. At its peak in
the 1970s, Guild was making about 100 guitars a day, said Dorothy
Gentile, president of the local Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   Guild's acoustic and electric guitars have been plucked, strummed
and banged by, among others, Elvis, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton and
members of the bands Def Leppard and Twisted Sister.
