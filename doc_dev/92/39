In an ideal universe, all rock albums would be titled "Adventure," or at least 
would try to live up to that label. To Tom Verlaine, whose seminal '70s band 
Television did indeed claim "Adventure" as the title to its second LP, that's 
the whole point of the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It always surprises me when I hear so many bands sounding like so many other 
bands," Verlaine said in a recent phone interview from his Manhattan apartment. 
"I always felt like there was an obligation to either do something fresh or to 
do something that somehow was like making something for yourself, really to 
surprise yourself." 
</P>
<P>
With Television then and in a solo career dotted with infrequent pulses of 
brilliance, the singer/songwriter/guitarist has created a body of songs that so 
sharply delineate interior emotional landscapes that they can seem like dreams 
held in place with a spike. 
</P>
<P>
Using a standard rock instrumentation, Verlaine's recordings construct 
multitiered architectures of sound, inhabited by a fearless fretboard style 
that shoves his electric guitar beyond the boundaries of musical reason. 
</P>
<P>
In light of his history of amplified excursions, Verlaine's current move 
certainly qualifies as adventurous. He has embarked on a solo acoustic tour, 
which began Tuesday at San Juan Capistrano's Coach House and continues tonight 
at Bogart's in Long Beach and Thursday and Friday at McCabe's -- with 
intentions of issuing an equally acoustic album later this year. But while at 
odds with practically everything he has put on record, the acoustic side is 
nothing new to Verlaine. 
</P>
<P>
"All the songs in the last bunch of years are written on acoustic guitar, and I 
started playing acoustic shows in '85 in Europe," he said, "It just had a 
certain appeal to me. Maybe it's an intimacy factor. It really puts you into 
your voice. And it actually puts you into your body in a way that electric 
music doesn't. It's a mystery to me, but it's something I like to hear and do." 
</P>
<P>
He initially wanted to do an acoustic album in 1984, but the idea was turned 
down by his record label, Phonogram in Britain. That proved to be the least of 
his troubles with the label, which, Verlaine claims, refused to issue one 
completed album and grievously remixed and delayed his last two releases, 
"Flash Light" and "The Wonder." The latter, recorded in 1988, wasn't issued in 
Europe until earlier this year, and remains unreleased in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If Verlaine's songs seem to be born of a dreamlike reverie, that isn't far from 
the actual source for many of them. "Pillow" on "The Wonder" is a haunting 
lullaby made up of fragmentary scenes from a relationship, some observed by a 
dove outside the couple's window. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the ideas I get seem to be when I'm falling asleep at night," 
Verlaine said. "I often hit this place where sometimes I can remember and 
sometimes I can't, but something goes on there. And sometimes it's literally 
like there's a bird there that you're having a conversation with. Often there's 
music there as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can wake myself out of it, or generally I kind of double up out of it -- 
it's a weird state -- I'll go to the tape deck and hum a melody, then fall 
asleep, and the next day I'll hear it and it'll bring some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
When not working on music or traveling -- he likes extended visits out of New 
York, such as the two months he spent in L.A. last year -- Verlaine pursues a 
fascination with the byways taken by the human mind. He says he once spent five 
months studying various psychoanalytic theories. 
</P>
<P>
"Or I hit moods where I want to learn about how somebody thought things that 
could be so foreign to me. It could be a poet, a theorist, a linguist, or a 
composer that grabs you. I was reading some letters by Liszt, and this guy's 
outlook is just so totally different from anything you would imagine for 
yourself, very courteous but ferocious, a strong character. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these interests color what I write. But I think that it helps 
keep your brain strong by studying outlooks that are so foreign to your own. I 
try to work out 'How and why did this person ever develop this?' " 
</P>
<P>
And if someone were to pore over Verlaine's own works with such an intent? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'd say, 'Well, this guy's method was chaos.' "
