   Minutes after mesmerizing an audience with
his electric guitar wizardry, rocker Eric Johnson is shyly greeting
fans and signing autographs.
   He talks with such humility and kindness that it's a tossup
which is more enchanting: the music he makes on stage or his boyish
friendliness backstage.
   Underneath the good humor lies a demanding perfectionism in a
musician on a quest for a brand-new sound from his '54 Fender
Stratocaster.
   ``The older I get, the more I listen to the guitar and go: `Oh
God. I need a new turn-on. It's got to do something more. Is this
all?''' Johnson said in an interview. ``You can get a screechy,
nervous, jittery sound out of the electric guitar and it's like,
gah, it's got to go farther now.
   ``I'm trying to figure out a way. I want it to be real
rocked-out-and-buzz guitar, but I want it to have a little elegance
to it. And in its real Neanderthal, paleolithic way, I want it to
have a tuxedo on.''
   Elegance isn't a word often tied to the electric guitar. But
Johnson was schooled in classical piano and he's found ways to
bring the two together.
   ``I try to listen to more classical music because of the chord
changes and the breadth of the music. To me, classical in a way is
the most unassuming music,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson, 35, first hit the Austin music scene in the 1970s at
age 15, mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that
evoked images of rock revolutionary Jimi Hendrix.
   The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was among those awed by his talent.
Vaughan once said that by the time Johnson reached his late teens,
he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to
keep up with him.
   Johnson's solo debut album, ``Tones,'' earned him a 1986 Grammy
nomination for ``Best Instrumental of the Year'' for the track
``Zap.'' However, the album had little commercial success.
   Nearly four years later, Johnson has poured his heart and
experience into a new album, ``Ah Via Musicom'' on Capitol Records.
The album and its rich instrumental ``Cliffs of Dover'' have
received favorable response and substantial play on album-only rock
radio stations.
   Johnson said the album has changed his audiences from the
musicians-only crowd to the fickle radio listeners eternally
searching for a new sound and new star.
   Some of the credit must go to Capitol Records, which has heavily
promoted the album, Johnson said.
   But the album also is the embodiment of what makes Johnson
great, his tireless perfectionism and insatiable search for a
different sound.
   ``I spent two months solid working on `Tones.' I spent 15 months
on this last record, not solid but close to it. I just did it over
and over and over, trying to figure out a way to get the guitar
tone like I wanted it,'' he said.
   According to Capitol Records, Johnson recorded ``Ah Via
Musicom'' three times with two bass players, Kyle Brock and Roscoe
Beck; three drummer-percussionists, Tommy Taylor, James Ferner and
Paul Bissell; and several arrangements.
   Brock, who has played with Johnson 20 years, and Taylor,
formerly a drummer for Christopher Cross, are traveling with
Johnson. The three joined rock guitarist Joe Satriani in California
in late September for three weeks of concerts on the West Coast.
   ``I like to think Eric's music is the music we're all involved
in,'' Taylor said. ``It's something a little promising and offers a
little alternative. So much of the music you hear is very
predictable. There's a freshness about what Eric does.''
   What Johnson eternally seeks from his guitar and amplifiers and
electronic gizmos is what musician's call ``tone.''
   ``Tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of
sound of a particular instrument - the way you play the instrument,
the emotion you put behind it, the technique, phrasing, all the
things that are elements of your art or your music that create a
sound,'' he said.
   Johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional
amplifiers and foot pedals from the '60s and '70s that lack the
computer chips found in today's equipment.
   In his live performances, he spreads a buffet of pedals before
his feet. While his fingers dance over the frets of his guitar, his
feet skip between the pedals, producing an energetic, intellectual
sound.
   ``There's kind of this side of me that treats it (the music)
like a laboratory where I work in the studio or I work in my
practice house and fiddle with all sorts of electronics and stuff,
trying to make the guitar sound better,'' Johnson said.
   ``I don't mean that with a negative connotation, but you play
for 20 years and it's the same old guitar sound. At this point, I'm
not reinventing the guitar, I don't have a whole new sound or
anything, but I'm trying to figure out a way to hone and perfect
the electrical guitar sound.''
