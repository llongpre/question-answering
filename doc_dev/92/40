<LEADPARA>  NEIL YOUNG'S Bridge School Benefit is more like a chance to hang out in
Young's living room and listen to some of his friends perform than your
typical arena show.;   Now in its fifth year, it's one of those
only-in-the-Bay-Area things that people in the rest of the country can hardly
believe.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ACOUSTIC NIGHT WITH NEIL YOUNG HAS POWER TO BURN  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Saturday night's lineup, including Willie Nelson, John Lee Hooker, Don
Henley, Tracy Chapman, Sonic Youth and Nils Lofgren in a five-hour show at
Shoreline Amphitheater, was stunning, despite a number of ragged points in the
sound system and one of the biggest failures in the show's history.;   Still,
for $15 a pop, this was a chance to see legendary performers stretch out and
try something new, while helping a worthy cause. It was thoroughly
entertaining, even at its low point.;   The show's premise is that performers
play acoustic instruments, although it is not strictly followed. Hooker, who
came out third, brought his electric guitar for three songs, including "King
Snake Boogie.";   "He's been playing his electric guitar all his life," said
Young, introducing him. "He's earned the right to do what he wants.";   Young
and Nicolette Larsen, who played with Young 13 years ago on his album "Comes a
Time," opened with Bob Dylan's "Forever Young," with Young on organ. Last
year, when he was leaning toward punk acoustic guitar, Young had opened with a
raving version of another Dylan song, "Everything's Broken.";   Folk
performers Larry Kegan and Gene LaFond played a pair of inspiring songs
challenging the notion of being disabled. One of them had the chorus "This
wheelchair keeps on rolling.";   Henley gave a performance not unlike his
Shoreline show this summer, singing while backed by a full band. He played
standards "The End of the Innocence," "Heart of the Matter" and "Best of My
Love." He added an excellent version of Joni Mitchell's "Wish I Had a River"
and a '40s love song, "Come Rain or Come Shine.";   Lofgren and Chapman did
half-hour sets that concentrated on new songs. Lofgren jammed with Young on
one and brought down the house on another with an acoustic guitar solo.
Chapman ended her set with a mournful version of "Amazing Grace," which she
dedicated to promoter Bill Graham. The audience spontaneously stood and sang
along, for a beautiful and sad memorial.;   Sound problems;   Then came Sonic
Youth in a memorable bust. On "Dirty Boots" and "Mote," they sounded great. It
was refreshing to hear them pump up acoustic guitars to get the energy they
usually get from feedback and distortion. But because the stage monitors
failed, they couldn't hear themselves.;   In the middle of "Cinderella's Big
Score" they stopped and gave up, yelling at the sound crew.;   "We just flew
in from New York," they explained as they were booed off. Kim Gordon smashed
an acoustic guitar in frustration.;   You could see why Young would like them
though -- they burned out; they didn't fade away.;   Nelson, even more a hero
for taking on the Internal Revenue Service, did a set of standards with a
couple of new songs. Backed by a chromatic harmonica player, he strummed his
guitar for "On the Road Again," "Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys," "Crazy," and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.";   His simple manner
and straightforward singing brought down the house.;   Backed by Larsen and
his old Stray Gators band, Young finished up with a set of his sweetest music:
"Long May You Run," "Birds," "Comes a Time," "Harvest Moon" and "Can We Get it
Together?";   A couple of weeks after releasing his most intense electric
album, Young was taking a direction as far from that as possible, back to his
most mellow songs.;   He called the others back for a sing-along reprise of
"Forever Young" and in Graham's memory, ended with a guitar version of
"Greensleeves," which used to close all of his shows.  </TEXT>
