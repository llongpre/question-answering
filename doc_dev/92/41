Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since 
the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted 
to his music," Voss said recently. "We get the 14-year-olds and the 
34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem to know who Jimi Hendrix was. 
</P>
<P>
"There's sort of a gap there -- part of a generation apparently doesn't realize 
what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed today." 
</P>
<P>
Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the acid rocker who 
used his teeth on the guitar strings in an unsettling, feedback-laden rendition 
of the national anthem at the Woodstock music festival. 
</P>
<P>
A former music journalist, Voss, 38, is founder of the Jimi Hendrix Information 
Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum of the star's 
memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter titled "Voodoo Child," a name 
taken from a Hendrix hit. 
</P>
<P>
He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the Seattle-born 
Hendrix since the musician's drug-related death in Britain Sept. 18, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20 hours a week on 
Jimi Hendrix," said Voss.
