<TEXT>     "We did a lot of marketing studies," Hard Rock founder Peter Morton said
Wednesday. "Everything gave us an extremely strong indication that there are a
lot of 30-year-olds in America who go to Bruce Springsteen concerts and like
to gamble.";    The 12-story Hard Rock Hotel Casino will display a replica
130-foot Fender electric guitar smashed into the roof and will feature a
circular bar topped by a revolving classic Cadillac.;    The resort will be
bathed in rock music, from the lobby to the parking garage. It will be built
beside a Hard Rock Cafe that opened in September.;    A porte-cochere will
feature columns of rock legends supporting an over-sized piano keyboard nearly
100 feet long booming out the classics of Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Elton
John and others, Morton said.;    The resort's 326 rooms and
25,000-square-foot casino will "feel like a Hard Rock Cafe," Morton said.;   
Plans call for a 50-foot, guitar-shaped sports bar overlooking a sports
betting parlor. A 2,000-seat tented arena is planned to host rock 'n' roll
acts.;    Harrah's Casino Hotels will manage the property.;    The Hard Rock
Cafe was founded by Morton in London in 1971. It has cafes in 11 cities, and
they are expected to gross more than $100 million this year.;    The Los
Angeles-based company plans to break ground on the project this fall.  </TEXT>
