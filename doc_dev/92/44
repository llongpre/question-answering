<LEADPARA>  WHEN guitar virtuoso Al DiMeola decided to make an album of Latin-American
music, he went straight to one of its sources -- the father of modern tango,
composer Astor Piazzolla.;   "The overall spirit of this record is an homage
to his genius and soul," says DiMeola, adding his current album "World
Sinfonia" (Mesa/Bluemoon) includes the Piazzolla number "Tango Suite."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     World Sinfonia also is the name of DiMeola's new acoustic quartet. The
group plays tonight through Sunday at Yoshi's in Oakland.;   DiMeola, 37, says
he spent the last four years being turned down by record companies. Because of
his reputation, which includes stints with Chick Corea's influential electric
'70s fusion band, Return to Forever, and 13 solo albums, the guitarist managed
to stay afloat by touring steadily throughout the world.;   "I fueled a lot of
the frustration into positive energy," says DiMeola by phone from his New
Jersey home. "But I'm dedicating the new album to the deaths of all the record
label presidents that turned me down.";   "World Sinfonia" is among the top 10
entries in Billboard's contemporary jazz albums chart. An electric album,
titled "Kiss My Axe," is due in late November.;   "I missed playing the
electric guitar," says DiMeola. "But it was not easy getting the major labels
to listen to my new stuff. Most people there are tuned to signing rap and
heavy-metal acts and they've lost touch with what's good music.";   Unlike
many contemporary jazz musicians, DiMeola believes there is still great
interest in the sort of frenetic fusion popularized by Return to Forever.;  
"That group broke up prematurely," says DiMeola. "It was a major mistake. We
could have sold out arenas. The record companies could not have been more
wrong. Fusion is more alive now than ever. In the industry, you're dealing
with idiots. They put money into rap, heavy metal and easy-listening jazz. I
can't believe there's that much bad taste.";   The state of popular music
bothers DiMeola to no end. Rap, he says, "has nothing to do with talent. I
mean, you've got musicians out there who have studied their instruments for
decades, and can't get arrested, let alone signed.";   As for heavy metal,
"how can anybody in their right mind compare the first two albums of Led
Zeppelin to Guns N' Roses? Zeppelin had something. There were some good tunes
and they played well. It was loud and metallic, but there was taste all over
the place.";   Although certain stations are playing DiMeola's new music, the
guitarist says he has "given up on radio because every time I tune in I get so
disappointed. There's a world of good music out there and it frustrates me
that nobody in radio recognizes that. People want something different.";  
DiMeola has strong words for guitarist Carlos Santana, who jumped on the
fusion bandwagon in the '70s, but remains a steady concert draw with his
Latin-rock band, Santana.;   "You can do what Santana does, which is play the
same notes over and over for the last 20 years," says DiMeola. "But I just
don't feel it's necessary to ruin the music with excessive displays."; Al
