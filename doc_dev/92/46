POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SURF ROCK'S HISTORY WRAPPED UP BY A LONGTIME DEVOTEE

Robert J. Dalley was hooked in an instant when he heard the surf rock 
instrumental "Pipeline" barreling over the radio one day in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, 15 at the time, bought an electric guitar with his paper route money 
and set out to become part of the instrumental surf music scene that crested 
during the early '60s, then ebbed with the arrival of the Beatles. But it was 
with a typewriter, rather than with a Fender Stratocaster, that Dalley 
ultimately wound up writing his chapter in surf rock history. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he wrote 41 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's book, "Surfin' Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties," 
devotes a chapter to each of 41 bands from the peak days of surf rock, 
including 12 hailing from Orange County. In each case, Dalley hunted up former 
members, got them to reminisce into a tape recorder, and compiled the 
histories, memorabilia and discographies that fill his 421-page, independently 
published soft-cover volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfin' Guitars" is a specialty project that will be of value and interest 
mainly to committed surf rock fans and early-'60s pop history buffs: Of the 41 
groups chronicled, only five ever placed a song in the Billboard Top 100. 
Dalley's plain but usually serviceable prose won't rescue any of the lesser 
lights from obscurity. But by giving a basic recounting of each group's story, 
along with reproductions of their photos, posters and press clippings, he has 
managed to safeguard them from oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
For Dalley, now 40, the book originated 10 years ago with his own attempt to 
regain a bit of youthful spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going crazy, not being in a band, not doing anything," said the 
friendly, broad-built Azusa resident who makes his living reproducing documents 
for microfilm. "The first thing I thought of was, 'Let's play some surf 
music."' 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, who grew up inland in Covina and never learned to surf, formed a surf 
rock revival band, the Surf Raiders, that stayed together through most of the 
1980s. In trying to recapture the authentic early '60s sound, he began to hunt 
for original surf music recordings. He also sought out two former members of 
the Surfaris, the band that created "Wipe Out," one of the most enduring and 
influential rock instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's aim was only to ask their advice on how to replicate the '60s surf 
sound. But the tape-recorded talks ended up forming the basis for an article 
that he submitted to Goldmine, the record collectors' magazine. Dalley soon 
began to write a regular surf music column for Goldmine, and he continued to 
seek out interviews with original surf bands. After deciding to compile a book, 
he cast his net as widely as possible, with the aim of making a comprehensive 
surf rock history. Dalley even enlisted the help of a private detective to 
track down a charter member of one hard-to-trace band. 
</P>
<P>
While Dalley rarely strays from his straight biographical narratives into 
analysis or social commentary, "Surfin' Guitars" depicts a musical period that 
had the qualities of innocence and a naive creativity -- qualities all but 
snuffed out in today's bureaucratized, conglomerated music industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Chantays, from Santa Ana, were teen-age musical novices when they started 
in 1961, inspired by Dick Dale, the Orange County surf-rock pioneer who emerges 
repeatedly in the book as a key influence on other bands. Within a year of 
taking up their instruments, the Chantays had written and recorded "Pipeline," 
the No. 4 national hit that hooked Dalley on surf music. 
</P>
<P>
Except for rap music, a grass-roots, cheap-to-produce form that pop's corporate 
masters haven't yet found a way to control, such sudden rises are virtually 
inconceivable today. 
</P>
<P>
Recording and promoting music has become a slow, costly, calculated business 
guided by long-term marketing strategies. One-hit, out-of-the-blue wonders like 
the Chantays -- or the Pyramids, whose "Penetration" was also a Top 20 surf hit 
-- simply don't get signed nowadays by major labels, which look at bands either 
as tax write-offs or as expensive, long-term investments. It is true that 
smaller, independent labels sign such bands all the time, but no prominent pop 
radio station seems to have the gumption to run with an unknown act's song and 
give it the airing it may deserve. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, surprise hits like "Pipeline" and "Wipe Out" were the norm. What the 
music business gives us today is a world in which surprise is barely possible. 
Aside from rap -- which requires the guidance of a technologically savvy 
producer -- there is no place in the pop mainstream today for the kinds of 
musically unschooled, naive enthusiasts who gave us surf music and its direct 
heirs, mid-'60s garage-rock and psychedelic rock. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiast's spirit lives with Robert Dalley. Before he could go to press 
with his book, he said, he had to come up with about $13,000 to pay for 
printing. He raised some of it by selling his guitar and amplifiers and -- 
after committing his favorite songs to tape -- by auctioning his collection of 
rare surf records. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done everything I can to promote surf music," Dalley said. "My book is 
the culmination of it. I don't see what more I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Dalley figures he eventually will at least break even by selling his first 
printing of 2,000 copies through an international network of surf music fans. 
The book, published in November, is on sale at Music Market in Costa Mesa and 
Soest Guitar Repair in Orange, Dalley said. Copies, priced at $28, also are 
available by mail from Robert J. Dalley at Dept. OC, 6209 Oakbank Drive, Azusa, 
Calif. 91702. 
</P>
<P>
As for hearing the old surf rock style played live, Dalley said, several 
revival bands and a handful of reformed original surf rock combos still 
perform, including the Surfaris and the Chantays. Dick Dale and the Deltones 
remain an Orange County rock institution; they can be heard Friday night at 
Night Moves in Huntington Beach. Information: (714) 840-6118.

La Habra's Mind Over 4 looks like a shoo-in for hardest working band in Orange 
County (if not the known universe). The quartet, which blends pounding 
thrash-metal with art-rock atmospherics, went into For the Record studios in 
Orange on last Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to singer Spike Xavier, and 
emerged Saturday at 3 p.m. after nonstop recording and mixing of a new, 12-song 
album. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hours' rest and relaxation, they played a Saturday night show at 
Night Moves. 
</P>
<P>
Why such a hectic schedule? Mind Over 4 recently signed a European recording 
deal with Destiny Records, a West German company, and wants to have the album 
out by late May when the band will begin a 2 1/2-month tour of Europe (with the 
Vandals, satiric punk rockers with Orange County origins of their own). 
</P>
<P>
Mind Over 4 was due to leave Wednesday night on a cross-country tour that will 
end with a showcase gig at CBGB's, the famed New York City alternative rock 
bar. Then it is on to West Germany for the start of the European tour, which 
also will take the band through Holland, Yugoslavia, France, Spain, Italy, 
England and Ireland. The Vandals will go on to Iceland; Mind Over 4 will fly 
back to New York in late August, play its way back across the country and 
arrive in Orange County just in time to start recording yet another album, this 
time for Powerhouse Records, a new Orange County-based label. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to take at least 5 days recording that one," Xavier said. In 
all, he said, Mind Over 4 expects to play 110 shows over the next 120 days -- a 
schedule with the potential to turn the most leathery-lunged singer's vocal 
chords into thin spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Xavier said. "I got the magic potion: hot tea and peach brandy 
right before I go on stage. It totally works."
