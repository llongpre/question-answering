A mural of the late guitarist Jimi Hendrix at a high school will not be 
whitewashed despite a petition by some students who object to the rock star's 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to accept that Jimi Hendrix's life and work can or should be 
condensed into, 'He is a symbol of drug abuse,' " Ridgefield High School 
Principal Elaine Bessette said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Fulkerson, the student who started the petition drive, said he is 
disappointed with the decision but added that more students wanted the mural 
than did not. He had said that it is hypocritical to display a symbol of the 
drug culture in school and collected nearly 100 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The rock guitarist died in 1970 at the age of 27 when he reportedly suffocated 
after swallowing a large quantity of barbiturates. The petition drive prompted 
the estate of Jimi Hendrix to issue an open letter defending the rock star as 
an artist.
