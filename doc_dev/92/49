<LEADPARA>  HENRY Threadgill's compositions carry a biological imperative: Grow or die.
They are alive not only in the sense that they seem to evolve as they unfold,
revealing themselves in sly and amazing ways, but also because they
recapitulate the history of jazz while moving it forward.;    Growing up in
Chicago, Threadgill, 47, played saxophone in marching bands, Latino clubs,
blues bands and even an Italian-Polish polka ensemble. Asked recently what
advice he would give to aspiring musicians, he said: Refuse to be limited to
one style or type of music; learn from all of it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ever-developing;  His own trajectory is proof of the wisdom of that advice.
In the '70s, he combined ragtime and the structural grace of Jelly Roll Morton
and Scott Joplin with an abstract, free-jazz conception in the trio Air (sax,
bass and drums). In the '80s he led a septet that included cello, trumpet,
trombone and two percussionists.;    Thursday he arrived at Koncepts Cultural
Gallery in Oakland -- the 19th scheduled stop on a national bus tour -- with
two tubas, two electric guitars, a French horn, drums and his own alto sax and
flutes.;    The substitution of Mark Taylor's French horn for the trombone
heard on "Spirit of Nuff . . . Nuff" (Black Saint) makes the group sound
smoother and darker. (The Koncepts sessions are being recorded by Taylor Made
Records.);    The tubas (Marcus Rojas and Edwin Rodriguez) are, of course, an
updating of the New Orleans marching band. And the electric guitars (Brandon
Ross and Masujaa) take a page from the jazz/rock of Miles Davis and Ornette
Coleman. But in the same group?;    It worked beautifully.;    As the big
brass pounded beneath, propelling the group with an irresistible force, Ross
-- in shoulder-length dreads -- bent blue notes in the upper register, and
Masujaa's shadings shimmered.;    Emphasis on texture;  Themes took shape
gradually, the melody sometimes emerging only after a long development. The
leader's gritty-grainy, vocalized alto was used sparingly. For the most part,
he was content to let his compositions shine. The emphasis was on texture, not
solos. At times it seemed the players were operating at different speeds:
drummer Larry Bright and the guitars fast; tubas, flute and French horn slow.;
   But if the music was challenging, it was also clear and completely
accessible. The packed crowd, almost entirely white and
coffee-house-intellectual-looking, soaked it up with a quiet joy. And the band
had a good time, too. Rojas grinned and bobbed as he and Rodriguez goosed the
beat. Taylor, who blew fiercely and articulately, was often seen cradling his
horn on his chest and gently swaying to the music, smiling beatifically.;
