   Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi
Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans.
   Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite
marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks.
   Twenty years after Woodstock _ and 19 years after Hendrix _
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped
define psychedelic rock.
   When Hendrix cranked up his Fender Stratocaster, the Earth
became ``The Third Stone From the Sun,'' and a nation of rebellious
youth grooved to ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   When he hit Woodstock in August 1969, his music and his career
were soaring. A year and a month later they crashed.
   He died in his sleep Sept. 18, 1970, while on a European tour.
The coroner's report said he choked on his own vomit. The trace of
barbituates in his blood was small, not enough to kill, the coroner
said.
   Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. He left Garfield High
School after his junior year to join the Army because he didn't
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his father's
landscape business.
   ``He wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder,''
said James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, referring to the patch worn by
paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division.
   Hendrix served after Korea and before Vietnam, when lyrics from
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers' helmets.
   He went by Jimmy in those days and was shy, his father said. The
shortened name and stage antics, such as squirting lighter fluid on
his burning guitar, were just show business he adopted later.
   ``He was a good boy,'' the 70-year-old Hendrix said. ``He played
Little League, football, swimming. We called him `Buster' 'til he
was 9 or 10. Then he wanted to be called Jimmy.''
   Jimmy and his younger brother, Leon, were raised by their
father. His parents were divorced and his mother died when he was
10.
   The family's console record player filled the rooming house
where they lived with B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and young Jimmy
mimicked the records, using a broom for a guitar.
   ``I had this old ukelele from one of my jobs,'' said his father,
a former musician in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I gave it to
him. Of course he couldn't get much music out of it.''
   So Al Hendrix paid a friend $5 for his acoustic guitar and gave
it to Jimmy. The first electric guitar was bought at a music shop
along with a saxophone for dad. When they fell behind on payments,
the sax went back, but the electric guitar stayed.
   ``I told him he'd go farther with that guitar than I would with
the sax,'' Hendrix said with a laugh. ``I never did get him an amp.
He used to plug into his friends'. Still, he got music out of it.
The Peter Gunn theme was one of the first things I remember him
playing.''
   Hendrix didn't return to Seattle when a back injury from a
parachute jump ended his military career. Instead, he headed East
in search of the music scene, and played in backup bands for the
Supremes, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard.
   Hendrix's guitar playing attracted a record producer who took
him to England. He became ``Jimi.'' Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding
were added to make the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
   The band conquered Europe, and played at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967, which led to a record contract and a tour with
the Monkees, the made-for-television pop group. Predictably, the
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short. By August 1969,
the Experience was finished but Hendrix's music was taking off. He
formed the short-lived Band of Gypsies with Buddy Miles and Billy
Cox, whom he'd met in the Army.
   Hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy, influencing a
generation of musicians such as Prince and Eric Clapton. His
records still are among the best sellers at many stores. The heart
of his discography remains ``Are You Experienced?,'' ``Axis: Bold
as Love'' and ``Electric Ladyland.''
   Seattle has been slow to honor Hendrix, partly because his
reputation for drugs and sex didn't seem exemplary for young
citizens. Garfield High School put his bust in the second-floor
library and, when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park,
the British director of Seattle's zoo volunteered a spot.
   Today, visitors must stand on the Jimi Hendrix memoril rocks for
the best view of the giraffes, zebras and gazelles in the zoo's
African savanna exhibit.
   A bronze sunburst marks the spot, and a sign in the shrubs
nearby reads: ``There's no telling how many lives your spirit will
go through _ die and be reborn.'' _ Jimi Hendrix.
