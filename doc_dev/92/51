   ``Take What You Need'' (Atlantic) _ Robin Trower
   
   Robin Trower's latest, ``Take What You Need,'' is for anyone who
carries a torch for 1970's-style hard rock and needs a dose of that
mix of heavy guitar, husky vocals and gut-kicking drums.
   Record company hype says the new album showcases Trower's
maturity as a _ gasp! _ songwriter. Don't believe it for a minute;
Trower's guitar playing is the main attraction here.
   And on that level, it works. ``Take What You Need'' comes alive
when Trower steps to the forefront and starts picking. Otherwise,
the album seldom rises above the ordinary.
   Trower's new four-man band opens with ``Tear It Up,'' a bouncy
tune with run-of-the-mill, looking out for No. 1 lyrics: ``I'm
gonna tear it up tonight _ This is my time _ I'm gonna tear it up
tonight _ Take what's mine.''
   Next up is a ballad, ``Take What You Need (From Me),'' which
features dreamy, liquid guitar work from Trower. This is Trower
doing what he does best.
   The last two songs on Side 1, however, show why they don't make
records like this anymore. The title of ``Love Attack'' tells you
all you need to know. It's unimaginative music with a dumb, macho
front. And ``I Want You Home'' has even less to offer.
   There's another nice ballad, ``Over You,'' on Side 2, as well as
the funky ``Careless,'' which has a guitar line reminiscent of Jimi
Hendrix' ``Machine Gun,'' and the genuinely catchy ``Love Won't
Wait Forever.''
   From the time he left Procol Harum to launch a solo career in
1973, Trower has been unfairly criticized as a Little League
Hendrix. It's a bum rap.
   He obviously was influenced by Hendrix, as well as other leading
rock 'n' roll guitarists of the era. But although he has never
attained the heights of a Hendrix, Trower continues to be a fine
guitarist whose licks stay with you.
   Whether his type of music still has an audience is debatable.
It's dinosaur rock, to be sure _ but pretty good dinosaur rock.

   ``Dream of Life'' (Arista) _ Patti Smith
   
   ``Dream of Life'' ends a nine-year artistic hiatus for
poet-singer Patti Smith, whose 1975 album ``Horses'' was one of the
best debuts in rock history and redefined the role of women in pop
music.
   The only thing redefined on ``Dream of Life'' is Smith: She is
now happily married and the mother of two young children. Domestic
tranquility appears to have robbed her formerly ferocious music of
the bite that made a lasting impression.
   Still, ``Dream of Life'' _ a positive and spiritual record _ is
occasionally moving. And Smith, in great voice throughout, is
generous with catchy melodies. She shows she has been listening to
the radio during the past nine years, cooing like Cyndi Lauper on
the pensive ``Going Under'' and borrowing from the Bangles on the
hook-filled ``Looking for You.''
   Smith, whose work in the 1970s represented some of the most
successful mergers of poetry to rock arrangements, occasionally
gets tangled up in her wordy lyrics. They suck all the energy from
``Where Duty Calls,'' a narrative on the Marine deaths in Lebanaon
that is an embarrassing mess.
   The best moments come at the end of Side 1, with the thumping
``Up There Down There,'' and the beautiful ballad ``Paths That
Cross'' _ both treatises on the afterlife.
   ``Those who seek feel the glow, a glow we all will know,'' Smith
sings on the latter. It's easy to forget that on ``Horses,'' Smith
opened with the words, ``Jesus died for somebody's sins but not
mine.''
   One lesson ``Dream of Life'' provides is that 13 years and two
kids will change a person's perspective.

   ``Re-Doo-Wopp'' (RCA) _ The Tokens
   
   The Tokens hold an honored place in pop music because of their
1960s hit, ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight.''
   ``Wim-oweh, wim-oweh,'' remember?
   You can forgive a lot for a song like that, but the Tokens have
gone beyond endurance in ``Re-Doo-Wopp.'' It is amazing that a disc
could include ``Little Star,'' ``Hush-a-Bye,'' ``Little Darlin',''
``Do You Wanna Dance'' and ``La Bamba'' _ just in the first six
minutes _ and yet be such a meadow muffin.
   The problem is this idea of ``re-do,'' or as the liner notes
explain, to mix doo-wop with ``today's recording technology to
satisfy generations of music lovers.''
   Like, we're awfully embarrassed by these old songs, but if we
put a really thudding, stupid electro-whizbang beat underneath then
you might, like, see the eternal timelessness of it all. It's the
same nitwit logic that sends old rock stars out in ill-fitting
toupes, prancing around like paunches had sex appeal.
   It's sad, because the Tokens are a tight group that does more
than justice to the harmonies which are doo-wop's heart and soul.
Doo-wop is music of street corners, subway tunnels and sock hops _
not great music, maybe, but deserving of a little respect on its
own terms.
   _ By Robert Barr, Associated Press Writer.
