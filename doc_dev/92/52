   A high school wall mural of legendary
rock guitarist and 1960s counter-culture hero Jimi Hendrix has
become an offensive symbol of drug abuse to a new generation of
students.
   Nearly 100 Ridgefield High School students have signed a
petition aimed at painting over the mural of Hendrix, who died of a
overdose of barbiturates in 1970.
   ``It seems a little hypocritical to have a thing that is such a
symbol of drugs,'' said Jonathan Fulkerson, a high school senior
leading the petition drive to whitewash the mural.
   ``I mentioned it to some people and they said, `Don't bother
with it,' or, `Throw a can of paint on it,' but I thought that
wouldn't be the right thing. I thought I'd see if the
administration feels the same way I do.''
   The 9-year-old mural, drawn from the cover a Hendrix album
titled, ``Crash Landing,'' shows him playing guitar as a robin
flies toward him. Hendrix was known for searing guitar solos that
became the hallmarks of songs like ``Purple Haze'' and ``Foxy
Lady.''
   Hendrix still has fans among the 1980s high school students.
Fulkerson said that, along with the signatures, he has collected
some harassment.
   Fulkerson said some students think the petition drive is
``goofy,'' while others have used harsh language to express
opposition. One of his friends has been threatened with a knife, he
said.
   Fulkerson said he has no plans for something to replace the
mural although a friend suggested using the space for an anti-drug
message.
   Student Council President Tony George said most students most do
not understand why anyone would want the mural removed.
   ``Most people don't understand what all the fuss is about,''
George said. ``I can see why Jon is circulating the petition, but I
don't really agree with it.''
   Assistant Principal Joseph Ellis said that if the students
present a petition, it will be reviewed. He said that some students
are ``creating a controversy where no controversy exists or should
exist.''
   Ellis said the mural should not be removed simply because
Hendrix took drugs and died of an overdose.
   ``A number of kids have spoken to me about this, and they don't
look at him (Hendrix) as a hero,'' he said.
