<LEADPARA>  Rock stars are coming unplugged.;    The recent Paul McCartney gig on MTV's
"Unplugged" show created plenty of attention -- and next month there'll be a
spin-off album. But in the little more than a year that it's been on, the
all-acoustic show has featured everyone from the Allman Brothers to the
Smithereens.;    The acoustic revolution is spreading. Daryl Hall and John
Oates left their electric guitars behind when they hit the Bay Area last
month. And other electric rockers -- the Black Crowes, Gun N' Roses, the Cure
-- have used acoustic guitars too.  </LEADPARA>
