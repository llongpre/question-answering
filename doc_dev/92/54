   Steve Earle weaves back and forth between rock
'n' roll and country, the soul of his voice in one world and the
wail of his guitars in another.
   Earle broke through with the album ``Guitar Town'' in 1986 after
one false start and a decade of paying his dues in Nashville. They
called his brand of hard-bitten, country-rock ``power twang'' and
compared his stories of losers and lovers in the small-town South
to Bruce Springsteen's Jersey ballads and John Mellencamp's Midwest.
   It ain't your typical country: A character in a country song
gets drunk on a bad day. Earle's anti-heroes split for Mexico, pull
a holdup or, like the title character in ``Billy Austin,'' get
executed.
   That's been done before, but Johnny Cash didn't back his stories
up with double-lead rock riffs and a big drum sound to go with
heavy doses of mandolin and pedal steel. Earle used the Irish band
the Pogues on his last album. In ``The Hard Way,'' his fourth LP
and latest with MCA, he did one song with the Christ Missionary
Baptist Church choir of Memphis, Tenn.
   Earle, who lives outside Nashville and has another home in Los
Angeles, will tell you he's earned the right to be different. A
childhood in rural Texas, on the road as a musician by age 16,
married at 19 and in Nashville by 20, digging swimming pools and
looking for a break. It almost happened the next year: a deal for
Elvis to record one of his songs. The King didn't show up.
   But Earle was selling a few songs, and eight years later, in
1983, he signed a deal with CBS. He didn't like the four singles
that came out of it, and an album they made wasn't distributed. But
three years later, he signed a seven-album deal with MCA. He's
since had some Top-10 country success, and the title song off his
last record, ``Copperhead Road,'' was a rock crossover.
   In a recent New York promotional stop for the new record, he
conceded the experimentation with a rock sound may disappoint some
country fans. Earle says what matters is the spirit of the music.
   ``There are some purer forms of country music, maybe by
definition, through the use of electric guitars and certain
electric guitar sounds and drum sounds,'' he said. ``But this is
the 1990s and nothing stays that pure. And when you attempt to keep
anything that pure, that's tantamount to inbreeding. It tends to
weaken the strain, not strengthen it.''
   The central character in many of Earle's songs is the
stereotypical working-class Southern man known in those parts as a
``Bubba.'' That's who's talking when Earle sings, from ``Good Old
Boy'' on his first album:
   ``I got a job but it ain't nearly enough; a $20,000 pickup
truck. 'Belongs to me and the bank, and a funny-talkin' man from
Iran.''
   Earle's own views are a bit more complex. He's against imports
and gun control, but he's also against the death penalty and loudly
supports causes at variance with his country fans.
   ``A lot of people decided that I was a hyper-redneck from
hearing songs like `Good Old Boy.' But Bubba is a composite of a
lot of people that I grew up with, and I don't have anything in
common with him. And I think some of my fans were probably shocked
at how left-wing my politics are,'' he said.
   Earle, 35, grew up in a small town north of Houston, not far
from the state prison at Huntsville. After he left home his mother
used to call him on nights when an execution was scheduled because
she couldn't sleep.
   ``You became very aware when you lived in that part of the world
that kids were going out there and sitting on the tailgates of
their trucks waiting to hear the announcement. There's this whole
circus atmosphere around it.''
   In the song ``Billy Austin,'' the title character contemplates
his death sentence for killing a gas station attendant:
   ``As the final hour drags by; I ain't about to tell you that I
don't deserve to die. But there's 27 men here, mostly black, brown
and poor. Most of 'em are guilty; who are you to say for sure?''
   Earle hopes his rock-style arrangements will make his message
songs palatable to younger fans. Many of their elders, particularly
at a major country shrine such as the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville,
aren't ready no matter how the guitars sound.
   Earle would love to play there but they've never let him.
   ``It's an older audience at the Opry,'' he said. ``You know the
old joke: `What has 30 arms, 30 legs and six teeth? The first row
at the Grand Ole Opry.'''
