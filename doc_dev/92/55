musical instruments against passing coat-tails, the roadie's beer or the
casual attitude of their own players

IF YOU knew an object was worth several thousand pounds, and was so delicate
that one crack could halve its value, you would normally treat it with some
respect. You would hesitate to entrust it to a teenager, bundle it into a
car boot, or lug it around on public transport. But people do this all the
time - a cello is designed to be played, after all, not locked away for
safety's sake.
Many musical instruments are not only valuable, but fragile, yet the
attitude of players can be somewhat casual. Instrument repairers point to
workshops full of cracked bows, left balanced on music stands, and chipped
violins, abandoned on chairs during rehearsal breaks with necks sticking out
to be caught by passing coat-tails. Brass and woodwind instruments are
slightly more robust, but cannot take rough handling.
A decent, student-quality musical instrument could be one of the single most
valuable items a family owns; older pieces, perhaps passed down through the
generations, can easily be worth five-figure sums. Household insurers are
usually willing to cover musical instruments up to a certain value, for
example Pounds 12,000 at Legal &amp; General, but you will need to ensure the
instrument is named on the policy, and you will pay extra for accidental
damage cover, or all-risks if the instrument is ever taken outside the home.
Sun Alliance charges Pounds 30 per Pounds 1,000 value for all-risks cover,
for example.
If you have an instrument you do not play, but which you keep as an
investment or for sentimental reasons, clumsiness or carelessness should not
be such a problem, but insurers will need to know that it is kept properly.
They will not cover hazards such as woodworm or deterioration caused by
extremes of temperature.
However, claims handlers at general insurers may not be familiar with the
peculiarities of musicians' requirements. Damage claims are more common than
theft claims, and expert repairs can be very expensive. Household insurers
are not used to paying large amounts for possessions to be repaired: it is
often cheaper and easier to throw out a damaged video recorder and buy a new
one, but few musicians would want to junk a 200-year-old instrument if it
suffered one dent too many.
The wording of most home contents policies is unlikely to allow compensation
for loss of value if a damaged instrument can be repaired, but will never be
worth as much again. If the instrument is ever played professionally it
becomes 'business equipment' in the eyes of many general insurers, and is
therefore excluded.
These are the kind of areas where specialist insurers may have an advantage.
They are more likely to appreciate the problems of antique instruments and
the need for expert repairs; also they do not draw distinctions between
professional and amateur players. Premiums may be lower than for an
all-risks extension to home contents insurance.
The biggest name in classical music insurance is British Reserve, a division
of Cornhill. It has been offering insurance for orchestral instruments for
three decades, and now has the largest share of the UK market. Pop and rock
musicians are excluded, but jazz is a grey area - 'serious' musicians are
usually acceptable.
The British Reserve insurance package covers loss and damage anywhere in the
world. There are 10 per cent discounts for members of the Musicians Union
and various other professional bodies. If you are happy for theft from an
unattended vehicle to be excluded, there is a discount of 20 per cent.
The minimum premium is Pounds 15 - the company aims to catch young musicians
when they acquire their first half-size violin or clarinet and keep their
custom as they metamorphose into soloists and orchestral players. Hired
instruments can also be covered.
Hartley Cooper Associates, part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation group, has just entered the market with a policy similar to the
British Reserve one. Again, the cover is intended mainly for classical
musicians, whether amateur or professional, and discounts are available for
members of professional organisations. Cover can be limited to the UK, or
Europe, or worldwide. The minimum premium is Pounds 50, for cover limited to
the UK.
Electronic instruments present different problems to underwriters. No
insurer is going to pay out if would-be rock stars start smashing up their
guitars on stage. But the disruption to a sensitive synthesiser's innards
caused by a carelessly placed beer can, or a rough roadie, can be covered.
The rapid pace of technical innovations means that badly damaged electric
guitars or keyboards are rarely worth repairing, even if the spare parts
exist - but a musician with an emotional attachment to the guitar he played
on his first big tour may insist on a repair no matter what the cost.
Entertainment &amp; Leisure specialises in rock and pop music equipment, even
disc jockeys' records and microphones, but it will also cover classical
instruments. Premiums depend on the type of equipment or instruments being
insured, and whether the things insured are kept in one building or need to
be covered for anywhere in the UK. The wider option includes an automatic
31-day western Europe extension.
As a rough guide, managing director Brian Martin quotes an annual premium of
Pounds 241 for Pounds 5,000 of heavy-duty rock equipment, and Pounds 160 for
classical equipment to the same value. A teenager's Pounds 500-worth of
electric guitar and amplifier, kept in the home, would cost Pounds 30 to
insure, or Pounds 39 if it was used in practices or performances elsewhere.
E &amp; L can also provide performers' public liability cover of up to Pounds
2m, and pays up to Pounds 2,000 for the hire of replacement equipment.
Galaxy 7 is another specialist offering insurance for musical instruments
used for classical, jazz, pop and other types of music. Even karaoke
equipment can be insured. The choice ranges from cover limited to a single
building in the UK to worldwide, including all transit risks. The basic cost
is Pounds 2 per Pounds 100 insured, with a minimum premium of Pounds 25,
plus a Pounds 7.50 documentation charge. Public liability cover can be
arranged as a policy extension.
