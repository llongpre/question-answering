<HEAD>Surf Music Pioneer's Guitar Stolen From Museum</HEAD>

   Someone broke into the
International Surfing Museum and made off with surf music pioneer
Dick Dale's first electric guitar, museum officials said.
   ``I feel sick about it, really sick,'' said Natalie Kotsch, who
chairs the museum's board. ``It was the most irreplaceable thing we
had.''
   Museum officials said Wednesday someone broke into the facility
over the weekend by removing louvered windows.
   The guitar, an unsual left-handed model with an ivory-colored
body and a dark wood fingerboard, was taken along with a
videocassette recorder.
   ``My concern now is that we don't want people to think that we
won't take care of the things we give us,'' Ms. Kotsch said. She
added that the Hard Rock Cafe had tried to buy the guitar from Dale
but that he had chosen to given it to the museum instead.
   Dale became well-known in the 1960s as the ``King of the Surf
Guitar'' with such hits as ``Miserlou'' and ``Let's Go Trippin.'''
