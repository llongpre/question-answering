<LEADPARA>  ON JUNE 14, 1971, two young Americans opened the first Hard Rock Cafe after
deciding there were no good hamburger places in London.;    Twenty years
later, the Hard Rock Cafe has developed into a veritable institution of pop
culture. This month, the 13 branches around the world are celebrating two
decades of their unique and successful combination of food, music and
memorabilia.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This lucrative connection with the music industry no doubt has had
restaurateurs everywhere wondering, "Why didn't I think of that?" But
according to Diane Brandon, the public relations manager of the Hard Rock Cafe
in Dallas, there was no blueprint for success.;    "In the London restaurant,"
she says, "the story has it that it was Eric Clapton that brought one of his
guitars in and said, 'Here, hang it on the wall.' Then Pete Townshend came and
brought his guitar -- it was like, 'If you can put his guitar on the wall, you
can have mine, too.' It's just mushroomed from there.";    The Hard Rock
ethos;  Today, the Hard Rock Cafes are visited by millions of tourists
annually. "There isn't anywhere else like it in the world," says Hard Rock
Cafe president Robert Earl, who bought the restaurants four years ago. "It's a
living museum. Staff enjoyment is second to none. And it's classless. It
doesn't matter who you are or where you're from. Anyone can get in.";    But
no one can say for certain why it's worked so well. "If we knew what made it
so successful, we'd have a hundred spinoffs all over," says Brandon. "It's
just a fluke.";    Imitators apparently haven't found out either. Although the
ubiquitous T-shirt has been copied widely, she says, "So far we haven't had
any problems. They can put musical things on the wall and play loud music and
call it 'Whatever Cafe,' but it's not the same.";    Hey, but cafes and
T-shirts won't remain the only things bearing the Hard Rock logo. In late '92,
the the $65 million Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas is scheduled to
open its doors. Plans call for a 130-foot Fender Guitar smashing through the
roof and a 75-foot long porte cochere shaped like a piano keyboard booming out
piano classics from Jerry Lee Lewis to Elton John.;    Bay Area history; Both
Earl and Brandon speak proudly of the way the Hard Rock's events and
memorabilia have helped build this mystique. The list of visitors is a who's
who of the music industry. Phil Collins ate at both the London and
Philadelphia Hard Rock Cafes during his dual appearances in the Live Aid
concert. Rock stars regularly show up when they are in town for concerts.;   
The Dallas restaurant, which opened in 1986, owns more than 1,000 pieces of
memorabilia, including Jimi Hendrix's only surviving Gibson Flying V guitar.
Brandon adds, "A couple got married under it. They traded earrings and
everything. They come for their anniversary every year.";    The San Francisco
Hard Rock, which opened almost seven years ago, is decorated with oodles of
wild stuff -- some depicting the area's local rock heritage, some just fun.
There's three gold albums from the Doobie Brothers, the San Jose garage band
made good, vintage Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane posters and enough
guitars and gold albums from Journey to start a yard sale. There's also an
autographed Rickenbacker guitar from Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, a Fender
Telecaster from Pete Townshend of the Who and various telegrams, lyric sheets
and photographs (even a lock of hair!) from the Beatles.;    Party hearty; The
Hard Rock Cafe's anniversary celebration has included 1971-theme parties and a
specially designed anniversary T-shirt. The San Franciscan eatery will hold a
free party Monday featuring the local rock band Jellyfish and give away a trip
to Cabo San Lucas. The event will be broadcast live on KFOG (104.5 FM)
starting at 9 p.m.;    To top off the Dallas celebration, on June 30 the
Fabulous Thunderbirds and the Arc Angels will perform at the Dallas cafe to
benefit the Nordoff-Robbins Music Clinic. The clinic incorporates music into
the therapy of disabled children. Similar benefit concerts are planned for all
of the restaurants.;     Rock 'n' roll charity;  This dedication to charitable
and public service is nothing new. Says Earl, "We coined the phrase 'Save the
planet' in the '70s, and we've been raising money and making people aware of
environmental issues since.";    In Dallas, the Hard Rock Cafe supports the
Salvation Army, children's hospitals and local elementary schools with food,
money and manpower. Last November, a Soupdragons concert was held to benefit
the Austin Street Shelter.;    The Hard Rock Cafe looks forward to the next 20
years as a time of expansion into Europe, Asia and Mexico. But Brandon says,
"I think we'll stick with the basic philosophy of doing more in support of the
environment and environmental causes. And I really hope we're still in the
middle of the rock 'n' roll business."  </TEXT>
