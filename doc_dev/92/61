   A wall mural of the late guitarist Jimi
Hendrix at a high school won't be whitewashed despite a petition by
some students who object to the rock star's drug lifestyle.
   ``I hesitate to accept that Jimi Hendrix's life and work can or
should be condensed into, `He is a symbol of drug abuse,'''
Ridgefield High School Principal Elaine Bessette said Monday.
   Jonathan Fulkerson, the student who started the petition drive,
said he was disappointed with the decision but added that more
students wanted the mural than didn't. He had said it was
hypocritical to display a symbol of the drug culture in school, and
collected nearly 100 signatures.
   The rock guitarist died in 1970 at the age of 27, when he
reportedly suffocated after swallowing a large quantity of
barbiturates. The petition drive prompted the estate of Jimi
Hendrix to issue an open letter defending the rock star as an
artist.
