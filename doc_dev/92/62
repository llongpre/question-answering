<LEADPARA>  AFTER Ricky Skaggs' performance Wednesday night at Paul Masson Mountain
Winery, one thing was apparent: He's a man who doesn't know when to stop.;   
Because it looked for a while as if he wasn't going to end his 40-minute,
seven-song encore. Or stop indulging overzealous fans with banter from the
stage. Or let up on testifying to the Lord.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But all that's what makes Skaggs one of the best-loved performers in
Nashville. That, and the fact that he never stops delivering some of the
finest traditional country-bluegrass music made today.;    With his eight-man
band, Kentucky Thunder (he could teach Lyle Lovett the real meaning of a Large
Band), backing him up, the virtuoso multi-instrumentalist swapped acoustic
guitar for mandolin, for fiddle and for electric guitar in one near-perfect
rendition after another.;    It's not very often that a performer can afford
to take such an entourage on the road, which made this show that much more of
a treat. It's rare to see twin fiddles on stage performing, let alone the
triple fiddles on one song.;    But size aside, the most impressive thing
about the band was the depth of the musicianship, most notably Billy Joe
Foster on mandolin, guitar, banjo and fiddle, and Keith Sewell on electric
guitar. Foster was a master of all frets, picking and sawing his way through
song after song. Sewell, who isn't old enough to drink legally even if Skaggs
did allow alcohol backstage, tore through his breaks with astounding agility.
We've not seen the last of this guy.;    Skaggs' set included a number of his
country hits flawlessly executed: "Heartbreak," "Hummingbird," "Cajun Moon,"
"Country Boy" and "Waitin' for the Sun to Shine," to name a few. Finally,
after shouts for "Honey (Open That Door)" that started nearly the moment he
walked on stage, he obliged 16 songs into the set, bringing a 6- or 7-year old
boy onstage to sing the last verse. Awwww.;    But what Skaggs does best,
dating back to his days with Boone Creek, is bluegrass. He doesn't do enough
of it anymore, having gone more country, but what he does is outstanding. As
pleasing as his tenor voice is singing country, it's even better in the high
and lonesome bluegrass tradition. Of the handful he did Wednesday, Bill
Monroe's "Get Down on Your Knees and Pray" and an electric version of the
gospel song "Walkin' in Jerusalem" were standouts.;    For his encore, Skaggs
came out without his band to sing four numbers by himself, and it was then
that he lapsed into most of his preaching. But it was saved from being
annoying only by virtue of the fact that even the most cynical couldn't deny
that Skaggs is completely, utterly earnest. He doesn't do it for effect, he
just can't, well, stop himself. Eventually, three songs later, he did.;    One
thing that did end too soon, however, was opening act Maura O'Connell, an
Irish folk singer with an arrestingly beautiful voice who sounds very much
like Tracy Chapman would were she a Dubliner.;    In her less-than-an-hour
set, O'Connell sang about the strife of her homeland and the hell of domestic
abuse with aching poignancy and incisiveness. From Nancy Griffith's "Trouble
in the Fields" she picked up with an old torch song sung with kittenish
charm.;    It was an obviously disappointed crowd that clamored for her encore
and got none. The least Skaggs could have done was thrown 10 extra minutes her
way.  </TEXT>
