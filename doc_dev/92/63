FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: Dave Holland Quartet - Ronnie Scott's

The pairing of double bass virtuoso Dave Holland and the edgy New York
altoist Steve Coleman is an unlikely success given their disparate
backgrounds. Holland is older, English and records for ECM, the sometimes
ascetic German label. Coleman is a young black American at the hub of the
burgeoning New York jazz movement, the so-called M-Base collective. But,
coloured by the electric guitar and drums of Kevin Eubanks and Marvin
'Smitty' Smith, their music meshes.
The quartet's wonderful ECM album of last year, 'Extensions', has already
showed that Holland is barely a leader here - all four musicians contributed
to the writing - and that the quartet is definitely not a vehicle for the
Englishman. Monday's performance, the start of a two-week residency at
Ronnie's, demonstrated just how dynamic a leaderless quartet of diverse
talent can sound live.
Holland, now resident in the US, plays pungent lines which are rich in
melody and tone. By contrast, Coleman's phrasing is angular and cagey.
Eubanks, standing, carves out heavy, rocky electric guitar breaks and, when
sitting, uses his many pedals to add colour and scenery to Holland and,
particularly, Coleman, during their solos.
Smith, barely visible behind a towering kit, directs the rhythm with an
urgency more in keeping with fellow M-Baser Coleman's playing than
Holland's.
Holland plays a great deal and his parts are long and strong. But because
the personnel apparently enjoy each other's material and tough playing so,
the music is more densely layered than a quartet usually produces.
No individual works up a real lather but then you wouldn't expect that from
the combined but barely controlled cool of ECM and the Macro-Basic Array of
Structured Extemporisation.
