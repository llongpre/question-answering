   Roy Buchanan, whose work stretched the
limits of the electric guitar and had an influence on musicians
from blues to country-western, died Sunday night when he hanged
himself in a jail cell, officials said Monday. He was 48.
   Buchanan, of Reston, Va., died after he was arrested on a charge
of public drunkenness and placed alone in a receiving cell at the
Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, said Fairfax County Chief
Deputy Sheriff Carl Peed.
   He was placed in the cell at about 10:55 p.m. Sunday and checked
10 minutes later. But when deputies made a second check at 11:16
p.m., Buchanan was found hanged with his shirt from a window grate,
Peed said.
   ``Roy was known for making the guitar squeal and snarl, playing
harmonics, a lot of innovative techniques,'' said Ken Morton,
spokesman for Buchanan's recording label, the Chicago-based
Alligator Records. ``People like Robbie Robertson and Jeff Beck owe
him a debt of gratitude.''
   Buchanan began playing in the early 1950s. An early influence
was note-bending guitarist Jimmy Nolan, who would go on to play
with soul singer James Brown.
   Buchanan had his own band in Los Angeles at 15. He went to
Oklahoma, where he met rockabilly legend Dale Hawkins, who wrote
and performed the hit single, ``Suzy Q.''
   Buchanan toured and recorded with Hawkins the next two years,
and in 1960 joined a Canadian group that included Robbie Robertson,
Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and was the forerunner for ``The Band.''
   He spent the next few years in a studio, backing singers as
diverse as pop star Freddie Cannon and country-western singer Merle
Kilgore.
   He left that work, formed another group and started playing the
Washington, D.C., area, where he became an underground favorite.
   Rolling Stone magazine discovered him in 1971, and its review of
one of his performances said, ``Roy Buchanan provides what may well
be the best rock-guitar picking in the world.''
   A public television documentary titled ``The Best Unknown
Guitarist in the World,'' debuted soon afterward and Buchanan was
signed to a contract with Polydor.
   He produced five albums, one of which, ``Roy Buchanan's Second
Album,'' went gold. He moved to Atlantic Records and put out three
albums, including his second gold.
   Between 1978 and 1985, Buchanan was largely a musical recluse.
He released only one album during that stretch, but moved back into
the recording studio on a regular basis in 1985.
   His work for Alligator included ``When a Guitar Plays The
Blues,'' ``Dancing on Edge (with Delbert McClinton)'' and ``Hot
Wires.''
