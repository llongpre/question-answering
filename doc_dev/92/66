<LEADPARA>  LARRY RINKER is the best putter in the Western Hemisphere. You can look it
up.;    Honest. Check the official statistics. More than 300 golfers competed
in PGA Tour events last year. But in the category of putting, Rinker ranked
No. 1, by averaging just 1.747 putts per hole.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For reference purposes, this is approximately 2.284 fewer strokes per hole
than the average duffer -- including those who play only miniature golf.;   
Rinker beats them all, however, at least by the numbers. He is the
Blademaster. He is the King of Ping. He is the Prince of Plumb-Bob.;    He is
also embarrassed, a little bit.;    "I had a good putting year in 1990," says
Rinker, sitting in a clubhouse easy chair here at the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am. "But I really don't believe I'm the best putter out here on Tour.";   
Then who is?;    "Morris Hatalsky," answers Rinker.;    Morris Hatalsky?;   
"Everybody talks about Ben Crenshaw being the best putter among the
superstars," Rinker says, "and he is very good. But when the Tour figured out
the statistics for the last 10 years, Morris was the best putter.";    Sure
enough, Rinker is correct. But we aren't here today to revive that classic
golf debate of Hatalsky vs. Rinker. Rather, we are here to debunk a classic
golf myth.;    You know the one we mean. It was spawned years ago, by the late
golf pro Bobby Locke when he poetically opined:;    "You drive for show, but
you putt for dough.";    To which Larry Rinker could now reply:;    "Oh, yeah?
Then how come I finished 117th on the prize money list last year?";    You can
look that up, too. Rinker may be the Tour's best putter. He may be the
Blademaster. But he wasn't even among the top 100 money winners last year.;   
"I guess I haven't been driving for show lately," Rinker says.;    Neither has
Hatalsky, it seems. He was 59th on the money list in 1990.;    This just
proves two things:;    1. Statistics are deceiving.;    2. Statistics in golf
are completely deceiving.;    The PGA Tour first began keeping detailed stats
some 10 years ago. But the problem with golf, when you try to quantify it in
numerical terms other than strokes per hole, is that you can't possibly factor
in all of the variables.;    It's true that the Tour putting stats only are
counted when players reach greens in the regulation number of strokes (to
prevent golfers who chip on from the fringe and one-putt every green from
finishing No. 1). Yet there's still no way to know, for example, whether a
putt was hit across a spike mark on the final hole of a tournament with
thousands of dollars at stake, or whether it was hit from a perfect piece of
turf on a Thursday morning with no pressure at all. Timing is everything.;   
Rinker, who at age 33 is still looking for his first Tour victory, understands
this better than anyone. It's probably why he goes back to his hotel room
every night and plays his electric guitar. He may not look like a former
member of a garage rock band -- Rinker has a freckled face, a trim haircut,
and a laconic manner -- but he always travels with his favorite Fender
Stratocaster.;    "When I travel to tournaments," he says, "I check my golf
clubs with the baggage, and carry my guitar onto the plane.";    He then hooks
up the Fender to headphones, so he won't disturb his hotel neighbors. He finds
it helps to relieve the tension. Thursday night here, Rinker didn't have much
of that, after shooting a 67 in the first round at Pebble Beach.;    But then,
Friday morning at Poppy Hills, his traditional problem surfaced. It is best
illustrated by another statistic. On the Tour list of "Greens Hit in
Regulation," Rinker ranked 157th last year. He reached only 61.8 percent of
greens in the recommended number of strokes.;    Friday, sorry to say, he
followed form perfectly. On the 16th hole, he hit his drive into the left
rough, then hit his second shot into a sand trap. He popped out of the sand to
within four feet, but -- here's the worst part -- missed the putt. Rinker went
on to shoot a 77, putting him back at even par for the tournament. Then he
went home to his guitar and, presumably, played the blues.;    Maybe that's
what Bobby Locke meant to say all along: You drive for show, putt for dough,
and strum for sanity.  </TEXT>
