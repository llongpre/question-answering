OUTTAKES: HENDRIX, UNFILMED

Janis Joplin got the feature-film treatment in the fictionalized "The Rose" 
(1979). Jim Morrison's life will be dramatized in Oliver Stone's upcoming "The 
Doors." But a feature film about legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix -- who 
died in 1970 at 27 -- is still without voltage. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Douglas, who supervises the production of the Hendrix music catalogues and 
related merchandising (including the upcoming concert video of Hendrix's last 
major concert -- at the Isle of Wight Festival), says he receives a steady 
stream of scripts -- many of them from independent producers and "smaller 
studios" that promise financing. At present, "a stack about 3 1/2 feet tall is 
sitting in my office." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, says Douglas, "they all say the same thing -- nothing. We've 
yet to see one that's got something to say about him that's special." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who produced Band of Gypsies -- Hendrix's final group -- says there 
were talks several years ago with Warner Bros. and various filmmakers. "But 
nothing ever got going. I don't think anyone understood how to write the 
story," says Douglas, who claims "Jimi was all music. That's what he was about. 
Consequently, you don't have the colorful stories of a Jim Morrison or a Janis 
Joplin. There are no sordid stories." 
</P>
<P>
But, what about all those tales -- many of which have made their way into 
assorted Hendrix bios -- about the sensuous rocker's appetite for women -- and 
drugs? 
</P>
<P>
"So what! The guy was a superstar at 25. Sure he had a lot of women. And, yeah, 
he did drugs -- like everyone else. But his isn't the story of a junkie." 
Stressing that Hendrix died of asphyxiation when he choked on his own vomit -- 
"not from a straight overdose" -- Douglas adds, "sex and drugs were a part of 
the backdrop of the times. But they weren't what he was about." 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that Douglas is being too protective of Hendrix? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm protective, in that I don't want some movie to go beyond the 
truth in an attempt to find some offstage madness and satanic drama. 
</P>
<P>
"Because that wasn't Jimi's story. Jimi changed the music. He's a reference 
point to every musician who ever picked up an instrument. I haven't seen the 
script that captures that part of Jimi, the metaphysical part that asks where 
did the muse come from." Pat H. Broeske
