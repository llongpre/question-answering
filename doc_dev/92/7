<TEXT>  "Les Paul: The Legend; and the Legacy"; (Capitol; CDs and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star); The role of the electric guitar as the symbolic instrument
of pop is now undeniable. But its rise began at the cusp of the '50s with Les
Paul.;   Paul not only redefined that role -- from a chugging member of the
rhythm section in jazz big bands to a solo instrument -- he provided it with
technical and technological innovations that have now become commonplace. He
designed the now famous "Les Paul" guitar and developed the multi-track
recording process and the echo pedal.;   None of these innovations would have
made much of an impact if he hadn't been such a dazzling guitarist. But he
was. And it is all to be had on this rollicking four-CD boxed set.;   From
such initial sparklers as "Lover" and "Caravan" to such hits as "How High the
Moon" he recorded with Mary Ford, his wife and vocalist, Paul's fleeting
phrasings and his melodic meanderings, all recorded in multi-track mode with
one musical section topping another in layers of sound, are the stuff of pop
history in the making.;   The historical side is documented by Paul himself in
the enclosed booklet with comments by the master on a track-by-track basis.
The scrupulously constructed set also comes with 30 unreleased songs from
Paul's personal vaults and such rare selections as several radio programs and
even the commercials he recorded for Rheingold Beer.;   Much of the material
-- and Ford's warbly vocals -- sound like period pop pieces from the '50s. But
his trebly tones and his acrobatic solos are constantly astounding and remind
us that it was Paul who set the stage for the work of such future guitar
heroes as Jeff Beck. And the sound and the innovations he achieved -- the echo
and the rest -- are the stuff on which all of modern pop is based.; -- Harry
Sumrall; Rock; JEFF BECK; "Beckology"; (Epic/Legacy; CD and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star)(star); Of the reigning triumvirate of Clapton-Beck-Page
that virtually invented the modern concept of rock guitar in the '60s, Jeff
Beck is arguably the most intriguing. While his two counterparts have pursued
somewhat static (if brilliant) creative courses (Clapton in the blues and Page
in heavy metal), Beck has been all over the musical map.;   "Beckology" charts
that course with the same sense of rollicking abandon that has characterized
Beck's career. In the process, it encapsulates some of the wildest, noisiest,
most eccentric, idiosyncratic, wonderful, remarkable, low-down and dirty and
technically breathtaking guitar licks ever committed to record.;   It opens
with three previously unreleased cuts of Beck scratching out the blues with
the Tridents in 1963. Astoundingly, the Beck sound with its whoops and
screeches and fleeting runs was there from the start, particularly on "Nursery
Rhyme.";   From there, the set is a non-stop roller coaster ride through
Beck's revolutionary work with the Yardbirds on such hits as "Heart Full of
Soul" (in which he mimicked a sitar) to the epochal "I'm A Man" that begat
every garage and metal band that has come along since. (The set includes four
songs the group recorded live for the BBC in its heyday in 1965).;   And from
there it is on to selections of his performances with eight (!) versions of
the Jeff Beck Group, collaborations with the Jan Hammer Group and former
Vanilla Fudgers Appice and Bogert and the solo efforts from the past decade.; 
 True to the inspired oddness of its namesake, "Beckology" comes in a box that
is made to look like an old Fender guitar case. (The cover of the enclosed
booklet with its scores of photos and Beck-related anecdotes is a guitar.) It
is, hands down, the best packaging of any of the boxed sets available.;   And
it's perfectly matched by the set's music.;   From the Martian take of Les
Paul on "Jeff's Boogie" to the eloquent interpretation of Charles Mingus'
classic "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" to the grandiose reading of "People Get Ready"
with old mate/nemesis Rod Stewart, "Beckology" proves that Beck has never
stuck with one genre or style. The only constant in his work has been the
uniqueness he has brought to every piece of music he has plucked.; -- H.S.;
JIMI HENDRIX; "Stages"; (Reprise; CDs and cassettes); (star)(star) 1/2; If
Beck and Clapton and Page invented the modern rock guitar, it was Hendrix who
embraced their various innovations and wrapped them up in one all-encompassing
onslaught. The Page metal riffs and the Clapton blues and the Beck noises
became in Hendrix's work a vast new world of sound.;   Much of that world
existed onstage, where he expanded on the sounds and songs of his studio
albums.;   While there are a number of "concert" records and CDs of Hendrix,
"Stages" is different in that it captures that world as it evolved over the
four years of Hendrix's legendary -- if brief -- career.;   Each of the set's
four CDs is drawn from individual shows (1967-1970) and comparisons of those
performances are variously redundant and illuminating. The Stockholm show from
1967 comes with notably straight renditions of the initial Hendrix hits as the
newly formed Experience feels its way through the material.;   The Paris and
San Diego shows (1968, 1969) are much looser, with the interplay between the
guitarist and bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell expanding in
various "psychedelic" directions. And the Atlanta show of 1970 (with bassist
Billy Cox) is a mostly sloppy performance that reveals the boredom that had
set in on Hendrix's part with the sound that had become his signature.;  
Songs such as "Purple Haze" and "Fire" appear on all the discs, with new
slants on each as Hendrix's sound evolved. And there are moments of inspired
spontaneity at various points.;   But none of this is new. Hendrix's volatile
shows have been documented on other records. And his real innovations, most of
which were accomplished in the studio, are obviously not included.;   This is
a set for true fans only. Anyone else who would like a full plate of Hendrix's
career should consult the excellent 1990 set "Lifelines: The Jimi Hendrix
Story," also released by Reprise.; -- H.S.; TEXAS; "Mother's Heaven";
(Mercury; CD and cassette); (star)(star)(star); Don't let the name fool you.
This Scottish dance-pop outfit is about as Texan as a cowboy in a plaid skirt.
Lead singer Sharleen Spiteri has a great big, sultry voice and a bravura,
Annie Lennox-style delivery that really lights up the often-unremarkable
material on the band's second album. The band's booming, epic-scale Euro-soul
melodies will spark comparisons with classic Eurythmics and the dance-floor
ravers Primal Scream. Instrumentally, the group borrows much from the lush,
seamless, keyboard-driven style of Bruce Hornsby. This stuff is an arresting
alternative to the din of hip-hop and house. "Mother's Heaven," "Why Believe
In You" and "Alone With You" are all rock-solid pop singles that deserve to be
played at red-line volume. It would be a pity to see a talent as big as Texas
get lost in the crowd of emerging pop groups.; -- David Plotnikoff  </TEXT>
