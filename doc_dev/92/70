The essence of surf music has been obscured by all the lightweight imagery that 
went with it back when the Southern California dream was being retailed to an 
eager nation: Frankie and Annette, beach blanket bingo, fun fun fun in the 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
All those trappings may have helped sell surf music back in its early-'60s 
heyday, but it is the core musical notion behind the style that makes it worth 
listening to now. The idea was to infuse a rock instrumental with the feeling 
of being caught up in a wild, elemental surge. 
</P>
<P>
As the prime inventor of surf-guitar music, Dick Dale is not likely to neglect 
that essence. It has been more than 30 years since he created the style in the 
long-vanished dance halls of Balboa and Huntington Beach. But playing Friday 
night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano with his current bunch of 
backing Del-Tones, Dale showed that he still knows how to take his guitar on a 
wild, dramatic ride. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's two 50-minute sets covered the lighthearted, beach party aspect of his 
genre with honking, horn-driven R&amp;B numbers, '50s rock classics and a few 
of his own more chirpy oldies. But the real thrills came when Dale, 51, set the 
bouncier stuff aside and got down to blazing dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
After quickie renditions of a couple of his lighter signature tunes, "Let's Go 
Trippin' " and "Mr. Peppermint Man," Dale began to play definitive surf rock 
that featured fast, staccato picking, reverb-soaked tone and careening slides 
down the neck of his old, gold-spangled Fender Stratocaster. It all came 
together on a propulsive "Surf Beat," then continued as Dale changed the mood 
to flamenco-style grandeur during a fine, shifting number that alternated 
between flurrying riffing and slow, stately Spanish motifs. 
</P>
<P>
The segment closed at a gallop, featuring the Del-Tones' punchy young 
three-piece horn section. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the early set, Dale and rhythm guitarist Ron Eglit got into some 
fiery dueling as they replayed the "Pipeline" guitar duet that won Dale and 
Stevie Ray Vaughan a 1987 Grammy nomination (the Vaughan-Dale guitar shoot-out 
is the closing track on a new, 18-song Rhino Records CD release, "King of the 
Surf Guitar: The Best of Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones"). 
</P>
<P>
The ideal way to see Dale in concert might be in one of those old-time rock 'n' 
roll revues of the early to mid-'60s, where each act got to display its best 
stuff for 15 minutes or half an hour. Then the set could be one driving wave, 
with maybe a couple of jaunty numbers like "Let's Go Trippin' " thrown in for 
relief between surges. 
</P>
<P>
But Dale and the Del-Tones also had a good-time, dance-band function to 
fulfill. They did a capable job of it, judging from the lively dance-floor 
traffic through most of the show (when the "Peter Gunn" theme turned out to be 
a crowd favorite, Dale took his band through three different renditions of it). 
</P>
<P>
Dale, looking like a craggy-faced John Wayne under his black cowboy hat, played 
most of the show off the cuff, singing a snippet of one song, then launching 
abruptly into another. A round-the-world routine in which Dale played just 
about every instrument on the band stand, including trumpet, keyboards and 
drums, had more shtick value than musical appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's audience ranged from old-time fans to fashionable, scrubbed-looking kids 
who would not have looked out of place at a Depeche Mode show. Being a local 
hero probably helps his continuing appeal, but Dale's playing remains a strong 
attraction on its merits, and a must-see for guitar aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
The surf-guitar style may be historic, but the wild rides Dale takes with it 
are by no means history.
