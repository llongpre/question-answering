   The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
purchased a handwritten copy of the rock anthem ``Purple Haze'' by
Jimi Hendrix for $17,600 at an auction, Sotheby's said.
   The sale of entertainment and rock 'n' roll memorabilia brought
$176,000 for a collection of handwritten lyrics, essays, song notes
and personal belongings of Hendrix, and $24,000 for Elvis Presley's
acoustic guitar.
   Only four out of the 60 Hendrix lots failed to sell at the
Sotheby auction on Monday. The collection was consigned by an
anonymous collector, said Laura Stewart, a Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   The 1966 draft in black ball-point pen on yellow-lined notepaper
is the earliest known to exist of ``Purple Haze,'' which appeared
on Hendrix's debut album ``Are You Experienced'' in 1967. The
lyrics were valued at $8,000 to $12,000.
   An anonymous buyer placed the winning bid for the Presley
guitar. The acoustic guitar finished in black from the 1970s was
sold by an anonymous consignor, Stewart said.
   The total for Monday's sale was $293,269, according to the
auction house.
