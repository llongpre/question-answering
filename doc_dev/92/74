   When Tracy Chapman played her Grammy-winning
song, ``Fast Cars,'' on this year's awards show, she did more than
just herald the return to folk-pop: She championed the acoustic
guitar.
   After a decade or so of synthetic sounds, the acoustic guitar is
making a comeback. The Traveling Wilburys play acoustics while
singing songs off their platinum LP. And Tom Petty's new record is
full of songs written on 6-string and 12-string acoustics.
   Chapman played a Martin guitar _ built by C.F. Martin &amp; Co. in
Nazareth, Pa. It is a handmade instrument constructed with care.
   ``I wrote and thanked her that night,'' said company chairman
Christian F. Martin IV, whose great-great-grandfather founded the
company in 1833.
   At the company's plant, 90 craftsmen carefully perform by hand
the nearly 300 steps necessary to turn Indian rosewood, Amazon
Mahogany and Hawaiian koa into an instrument. Another 100 make the
strings for the instrument.
   The work is time-consuming. The wood is aged up to six months in
the climate-controlled work area. Almost all of the work is done by
hand, with the pearl inlay taking up to two weeks per guitar.
   From start to finish, it takes three months to build a Martin
guitar.
   Most are Dreadnoughts, a widely copied acoustic instrument named
after a class of World War I British battleships.
   ``Ask someone to draw an acoustic guitar and he'll draw a
Dreadnought,'' Martin said.
   The Dreadnought _ which means ``fear nothing'' _ was designed in
1931 by the company for country-western singers who needed a big,
loud guitar. It is pear-shaped, with an extra wide and deep body to
produce a stronger bass and clearer treble.
   The original design is still the most popular, and Martin said 75
percent of the 8,500 instruments made this year at the plant will be
Dreadnoughts.
   This year, the company introduced its first acoustic bass. Priced
between $2,050 and $2,350, the original allotment of 50 intruments
were almost immediately sold out.
   ``We heard Tracy Chapman bought one the first day it was in the
stores,'' Martin said.
   The company now plans on building 350 this year, but even that
won't fill all the orders. ``We can't just crank up production,''
Martin said.
   But most changes do not catch on. Martin Guitar introduced an
acoustic guitar with a polished black finish. It didn't sell because
musicians wanted the natural wood color.
   ``I thought it would fit with some bands who have outlaw
images,'' Martin said. ``The guitar is thousands of years old.
People wouldn't want us to change it much. They want to buy the
guitar their father bought.''
   After a peak year in 1971 _ when Martin produced 22,627
instruments, the market slowly declined. Electronic instruments
became big in the late 1970s, and the nation suffered a recession,
severely damaging business for the country's acoustic guitarmakers.
   Martin's annual sales fell from $18 million to $12 million, and
the company was forced to close factories in Connecticut and New
York, as well as sell subsidiaries in Sweden and a drum company
called Fibes in nearby Easton, Pa. About 330 of 550 employees were
laid off.
   The business started to turn around in 1985, when some musicians
became tired of the electronic instrument sound. Also, the economy
had rebounded enough that people could afford a Martin _ which runs
between $1,000 and $5,000.
   Then came Susanne Vega's folk hit, ``Luka'' in 1987. She received
three Grammy nominations for her song about child abuse. Then came
Chapman's ``Fast Cars,'' a bracing look at inner-city poverty that
won three Grammys.
   Oddly enough, the company's founder, Christian Frederick Martin,
came to the United States in 1833 because guitars were regarded as a
fad in Germany.
   The Martins had been members of the Cabinet Makers Guild, and
when Christian Martin attempted to set up a guitar-making business,
the Violin Makers Guild attempted to stop him.
   ``They said it was just a fad, but they didn't want him to make
the instruments'' Martin said.
   Although he successfully went to court and won the right to
produce guitars, he decided to leave Germany and come to the United
States.
   He began building guitars in New York City, and was an immediate
success.
   ``That's because the guitar is American,'' Martin said. ``When
people were moving out West, what would they play around the
campfire? The guitar. A piano was too big for them to bring along.''
   Tired of the big city, he moved to Nazareth in northeastern
Pennsylvania, where the company has survived through good and bad
times.
   Even in bad times, there will always be a market for a well-made
guitar, said Martin. ``Some artists won't use anything else.''
   Also, many artists who perform on electric guitars actually
compose on acoustics. The Who's Pete Townshend, who uses one on the
band's current reunion tour, mainly writes on acoustic guitars.
   Still, Martin knows that today's acoustic success can be fleeting.
   ``It's a cyclical business. We don't have the clout to change the
direction of music,'' he said.
   But with some trends, such as the electronic instruments in the
1980s, the later models make the earlier ones obsolete. Guitars,
however, can last forever.
   ``Acoustic instruments get better with time,'' Martin said. ``The
day you buy a guitar is the worst it will sound.''
