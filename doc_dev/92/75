<LEADPARA>  THE Abandoned Luncheonette is reopen for business.;    The acoustic-backed,
soulful vocals of Daryl Hall and John Oates -- using a sound they had before
they became the most successful duo in the history of pop charts -- are
returning in a string of intimate and acoustic concert dates harking back to
the days when songs like "She's Gone" and "Sara Smile" were favorites of rock
stations.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's part of our tradition," says Oates. "It's as valid a part of musical
tradition as anything we've done. We just haven't done it in a while. People
don't look at the overview. They only want to know what was your last hit.";  
 Quiet again;    It is easy to recall the string of hits that made Hall and
Oates more successful than the Righteous Brothers and Simon and Garfunkel as
pop's biggest duo -- "Kiss on My List,' "You Make My Dreams," "I Can't Go for
That," "Did It in a Minute," "Maneater," "One on One" and "Adult Education"
among them.;    But the latest incarnation of the duo, which surfaced on the
recent, quieter "Change of Season" album, has them closer to things on their
folky first album, "Whole Oates.";    "That's how John and I started," Hall
says. "When we first got together, John was playing acoustic guitar, and I was
playing mandolin, the electric keyboard and a little guitar. And we used to
play small clubs and things like that.";    They played as a duo for a year
before they added a band, he says. "Then we had a similar situation where we
added a drum and a guy playing bass who also played upright bass and bowed
bass, so we had that drony string sound, which we're doing on this tour. We
have a violinist and a cellist with us in addition to the regular band, which
gives it a real R&amp;B feel.";    A guitarist, drummer, saxophone player and a
couple of grand pianos join them on the current tour. "It's as acoustic as you
can make it in 1991 and still play to a lot of people," Oates says.;   
Although none of the guitars will be electric, he adds, "The one concession we
have is that we've decided to use our Hammond B-3 organ. Only because it's
old, and it's made out of wood. We figured that somehow that qualified it.";  
 Besides some songs on the new album that work well in spare arrangement, they
perform old chestnuts -- "songs we haven't played in years, some of which
we've never played live," Oates says. "Going back to the 'Abandoned
Luncheonette.' ";    There is no saying Hall and Oates won't go back to the
big, dance-oriented sound they helped make popular on the Top 40 airwaves,
Hall says. "But it felt like some of the heart left music in the late '80s,
and I wanted to rediscover it in ourselves as well as put it out.;    "I'm a
little tired of hearing the same drum machine program being played all the
time," he says. "Also, I liked the idea of having musicians playing together
-- the real interaction you get only if people are playing real instruments.";
   "We wanted to play on our strengths -- songwriting and our singing," Oates
says. A more spare album helped show that off. "When you stripped it down --
and the production isn't the star of the show, the meat and potatoes show
through, and that's the songs and the singing.";    Record-company resistance;
   Was there resistance to this quiet approach from a record company that
expected more hits?;    "In a word," says Oates, "yes.;    "In pop music,
everyone likes you to be the same. They want that package of cereal. They
recognize the Wheaties box, and it's easier to grab it off the shelf without
looking at it than it is to actually think about it. There's a lot of safety
in that. There's a lot of security in it. But it's the first step in creating
a rut for yourself that you can't get out of.";    "Arista is a very
urban-oriented, very singles-oriented company," Hall says. "They went, 'I
don't know. This sounds great, but it's not "The Hitmakers of the '80s Sound."
' I said, 'That's right.' ";    Part of their return to roots has to do with
their escape from the city. Hall lives near Pawling, N.Y., where the album was
recorded; Oates has become a Connecticut resident, living in Redding.;   
Changing some of their hits to an acoustic arrangement for the current tour
wasn't as hard as they thought it would be, Oates says. "Even a song like 'No
Can Do.' We thought, now here's a song we'll never be able to pull off. It's
got a drum machine, a real strong electric guitar sound, that kind of thing.
But it sounds great. It sounds different, but it sounds great."  </TEXT>
