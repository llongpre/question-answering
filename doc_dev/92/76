Bill Frisell's guitar playing has always been out of kilter with the
mainstream, so it seems quite natural that now he should be applying it to
silent film. Commissioned by a New York arts centre to write new scores for
a set of Buster Keaton silents, the elliptical tunes which resulted met with
such approval from US audiences that he did more, and then recorded some
too. In this European tour he brings his regular band of Joey Baron (drums)
and Kermit Driscoll (bass) to accompany three of the best, the short
classics Go West, The High Sign and One Week.
To play alongside great American film is a natural progression for
42-year-old Frisell. He has a passion for popular American music and recent
recordings have covered works from such diverse sources as Madonna, Charles
Ives, Sonny Rollins and de Sousa. With musical anarchist John Zorn, he has
collaborated in coruscating improvisation where Mickey Spillane's gangster
yarns were the inspiration.
In Keaton's deadpan hilarity, the American modernist has another ideal
setting for his own cynical humour. The music, like Keaton's visual art, is
fundamentally melancholic, but filled out with pratfalls and gags. The
guitarist's playing combines a concentration on melody that reveals a
background as a clarinettist and a love of dissonance that comes from
listening to Hendrix. Frisell's studied way with solos mirrors Keaton's
modus operandi of 'Think slow, act fast'.
You might guess from this that the trio's music for films is anything but
easy, and any preconceptions based on the traditional ragtime, lid-slamming
treatment of silent films were quickly dispersed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall
on Wednesday. Frisell comes equipped with two electric guitars, one looking
as though it has been in a car smash, the other shrunk in the wash. There
are no fierce guitar licks where you might expect Frisell to join the car
chase, and there are no wah-wah sounds when Keaton see-saws on the ladder.
Instead, using the volume pedal to gently turn notes on and off, Frisell
quietly captures the sadness and romanticism of the scenes as they roll by.
The rhythm section orientates the score, Baron providing some essential
rat-tat-tat and Driscoll moving the whole along but Frisell's self-contained
sound is forever following The Great Stone Face's body language.
Hard to take on its own, the coupling is what multi-media was made for.
