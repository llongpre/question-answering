   ``The Great Lawn'' (Columbia) _ Ross Traut and Steve Rodby
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   That could be a typo in the title of the debut album by the
quasi-jazz duo of electric guitarist Ross Traut and bassist Steve
Rodby. ``The Great Yawn'' would be more like it.
   The record is appealing for its sparse texture, but once the
novelty of these simple instrumental arrangements wears off,
there's little to sustain a listener's attention.
   ``The Great Lawn'' is most reminiscent of Pat Metheny _ Traut
and Rodby have both played with him. But Traut isn't nearly as
inventive a guitarist; he rarely strays far from the melody.
   And Traut and Rodby seem to be waiting for each other to take
charge. As a result, the energy level peaks at about a two on a
10-point scale. The most animated the duo gets is when Rodby
occasionally slaps his bass.
   One wonders how much the label, Columbia, had to do with the
artists' cautious approach to their debut. The company hails the
record as spanning ``many musical categories _ Jazz, New Age, Pop,
R&amp;B ... and Beautiful.'' With Traut and Rodby trying to please so
many audiences, it's a wonder they were able to come up with any
notes at all.
   ``The Great Lawn'' is OK as background music, but bring a book
along.

   ``Mr. Jordan'' (Atlantic) _ Julian Lennon
   
   You're Julian Lennon, and you've got two image problems to
dispel.
   One is that you're a wimp. The other is you sound too much like
your late father.
   The surprising vigor of Lennon's third album, ``Mr. Jordan,''
takes care of the first problem. And the new deep voice Lennon
unveils handles the second.
   But now he sounds like David Bowie.
   Really. It's uncanny, on the songs ``Now You're in Heaven'' and
``I Want You to Know,'' how much Lennon sounds like the late-period
Bowie. Sounding too much like someone else, of course, is never a
good sign for a musician.
   Actually, you should be glad you're not Julian Lennon. He's not
to be envied. To be the son of such an icon and emerge with your
head on straight is a victory in itself. To follow in your dad's
footsteps and have at least nominal success is quite an achievement.
   But let's face it, Julian Lennon really should find another line
of work. Lennon has no real style and precious little to say. ``Mr.
Jordan'' proves only that he can surround himself with adept
professionals and not be embarrassed.
   One wonders if the louder guitars and harsher rhythms on ``Mr.
Jordan'' show Lennon's true inclinations as a rocker or his
Zelig-like response to those who said he should toughen his sound.
   ``I Get Up,'' with lively back-up vocals, is the best effort
here. But even on this song Lennon sees fit to include an Elvis
Presley impersonation. Who's next?
   The more aggressive approach sounds better than the ponderous
sweetness of Lennon's first two albums. But only nominally. And
don't look to Julian Lennon for any sparkling originality.
