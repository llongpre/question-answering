   Elvis Presley's acoustic guitar sold for $24,200
and Jimi Hendrix's handwritten lyrics for the rock anthem ``Purple
Haze'' brought $17,600 at an auction, Sotheby's said Tuesday.
   The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland placed the winning
bid for the lyrics, the auction house said.
   The 1966 draft in black ball-point pen on yellow-lined notepaper
is the earliest known to exist of ``Purple Haze,'' which appeared
on Hendrix's debut album ``Are You Experienced'' in 1967. The
lyrics were valued at $8,000 to $12,000.
   Only four of 60 Hendrix lots failed to sell at Monday's sale.
The collection of handwritten lyrics, essays, song notes and
personal belongings was consigned by an anonymous collector, said
Laura Stewart, a Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   The Hendrix collection brought $176,000. The total for the sale
of entertainment and rock 'n' roll memorabiia was $293,269, the
auction house said.
   An anonymous buyer placed the winning bid for the Presley
guitar, which was estimated to sell for $15,000 to $20,000. The
custom-made guitar from the 1970s was finished in black with
``Elvis Presley'' inscribed in a mother-of-pearl inlay across the
fretboard.
   The guitar was sold by an anonymous consignor, Stewart said.
