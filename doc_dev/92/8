<MEMO>  Obituaries;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/2/91, pg. 5B);  Because of
an editor's error, a headline in Monday's Mercury News incorrectly identified
Clarence Leo Fender, a guitar maker who died March 21.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I'll treasure his guitar as long as I shall live," Dean said.;    Other
musicians, including steel guitarist Alvino Rey, performed at the ceremony to
thank the man who invented the famed Telecaster and Stratocaster guitars
despite being unable to read music or play instruments.;    Mr. Fender's
guitars first were favored by country and western musicians who were persuaded
to try them out in the early 1950s. Some at the service said they owed their
careers to him.;    "He has contributed more to the music industry than any
other individual," said Hank Penny, longtime friend and western band leader.  </TEXT>
