SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SINGER LAMENTS THE LACK OF CLUB DATES 
IN SAN DIEGO

Frustrated by the lack of local club dates for jazz singers, Cath Eckert gave 
up on clubs last spring and has been making a living doing casuals -- parties, 
weddings, conventions. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be back in a club for the first time since then when she appears 
Wednesday evenings, from 5:30 to 9:30 through December, at the U.S. Grant Hotel 
lounge downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"My main main love is jazz, and I do it whenever I can," said Eckert. 'But for 
a while, I said, 'Forget it, it's too much trouble.' To get a jazz gig, you 
have to be able to pack the place, and you end up spending all your time 
mailing out flyers." 
</P>
<P>
Eckert said opportunities for jazz singers seem to be at an all-time low in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's happened. You'd think with the popularity of Diane Schuur 
and other singers that jazz vocalists would be popular. There are some singers 
out there, but mostly doing R&amp;B, 1950s and Top 40 stuff." 
</P>
<P>
At the Grant, Eckert will be singing standards such as Tadd Dameron's "If You 
Could See Me Now," Latin versions of jazz pieces such as "I Concentrate on You" 
and "Street of Dreams," plus holiday songs including "Have Yourself a Merry 
Little Christmas" and "The Christmas Song." She'll be joined by husband Chris 
Conner on bass and Mike Wofford on piano. 
</P>
<P>
"Luv in the Afternoon," the new album by San Diegans Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham 
and the Sweet Baby Blues Band, continues the band's punchy blend of jazz and 
blues, but with a special grit: the guitar of guest performer Clarence 
(Gatemouth) Brown. Brown contributes his bluesy string bends and T-Bone 
Walker-inspired jazz-blues lines to three songs. The album mixes originals by 
the Cheathams with blues standards such as "Don't You Feel My Leg" and "Baby 
Please Don't Go." Jeannie Cheatham's earthy vocals and swinging piano drive the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The music is rock solid, but it doesn't have the heat of the band's live 
performances. For that, you can visit Elario's later this month, where they 
close 1990 with a weeklong stay that ends New Year's Eve. It's been a busy year 
for the Cheathams: They appeared at the Blue Note in New York City and guested 
on the "Today Show" in August, played the Chicago Jazz Festival in September 
and entertained travelers aboard the S.S. Norway during a jazz cruise to the 
Virgin Islands. They also made the cover of the September/October issue of 
"Living Blues" magazine, which contained an article on them by San Diegan Jim 
Trageser. 
</P>
<P>
John Patitucci, who opens five nights at Elario's on Wednesday, is equally 
adept at either electric or acoustic bass. On his new album, "Sketchbook," for 
example, Patitucci's playing ranges from earthy, acoustic bass beneath Michael 
Brecker's Coltrane-inspired sax on " 'Trane" to a sliding, sensuous sound on 
six-string electric bass in the funky "Joab." 
</P>
<P>
Patitucci's significant break came in 1985, when he was asked by Chick Corea to 
join the keyboard player's Elektric Band. He continues to play with Corea while 
pursuing a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
"Sketchbook" is his third album. Few bassists are worth several minutes of solo 
time, but Patitucci is one exception. From the difficult upright bass, for 
example, he wrings rapid-fire lines with the ease of the best electric guitar 
players, and he matches saxophonists one-on-one, playing speedy melody lines in 
unison. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer, Patitucci is coming of age. He wrote most of the music on the 
new album (which rated 4 1/2 stars out of 5 in "Downbeat"), and his tastes run 
from jazz to funk to Brazilian. At Elario's, Patitucci will be joined by 
drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, keyboardist John Beasley and saxophonist Steve 
Tavaglione.

Beginning Dec. 10, KIFM (98.1) will operate from quarters matching its slick 
on-air image. After four years in an anonymous stucco building in Kearny Mesa, 
the station has spent $1.8 million on a 10-year lease, equipment and interior 
design for a 6,500-square-foot space in the Tishman Hurst Town Centre in La 
Jolla's Golden Triangle, visible from Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
A black marble floor and a splotch-painted wall that looks like a moody sky 
greet visitors. Other walls are painted in bright shades of blue and grape, 
reminiscent of a sixties record store. The new, larger space will accommodate a 
growing music collection, which station program director Bob O'Connor hopes to 
increase from 125 CDs to 1,000 in the months ahead. The station also has about 
1,000 record albums, especially of straight-ahead jazz not available on CDs. 
With the popularity of Ron Galon's Sunday night straight-ahead show, the 
station plans to expand its straight-ahead collection. 
</P>
<P>
