<LEADPARA>  AFTER opening her show Friday night with a gorgeous version of "Sunshine in
December," Emmylou Harris greeted the audience by alluding to a little cloud
in August.;   "It's good to be here," she said, "in a honky-tonk where music
was meant to be played."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  EMMYLOU HARRIS IS STILL AT THE HEART OF COUNTRY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Harris wasn't meant to play her San Jose engagement at the Cabaret. But
torpid ticket sales prompted the promoters to bail out of the original venue,
the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts. (Harris perhaps was disappointed,
but probably no more than the fans who held front-row tickets to the CPA show
only to have to hassle with non-reserved, elbow-to-elbow seating in a
decidedly inelegant club.);   But that's about all that could be described as
disappointing. Harris, besides bringing one of the sweetest and most enduring
voices in country music, had in tow some of the finest instrumentalists
playing today.;   Missed opportunity; Concert promotion is a tricky business.
But, second-guessing anyway, it's hard to fathom why Harris' band, the Nash
Ramblers, wasn't given more visibility in ads. That alone probably would have
sold a few hundred more tickets, maybe even enough to keep the show from
moving across town.;   On mandolin and fiddle was Sam Bush (New Grass Revival,
Strength in Numbers), who's among the most gifted and dynamic of the New
Traditionalists, and has a following of his own. Roy Huskey Jr., on bass, is
one of the most in-demand session musicians in Nashville. And Al Perkins'
dobro and banjo playing show the patina of years of performing, most notably
as a Brother in the Flying Burrito clan. John Randall Stewart on lead acoustic
guitar and harmony vocals, and drummer Larry Atamanuik (Seatrain) fleshed out
this powerhouse of a band.;   A country band of a different sort opened for
Harris, Todd Holcolmbe and Hearts on Fire, direct from Millbrae.;   Holcolmbe
plays acoustic rhythm guitar and has a pleasant but not particularly
distinctive baritone. He's backed up by an electric guitar, electric bass,
electric keyboards and drums.;   Not ready for prime time;   They do decent
but not particularly distinctive covers of popular country tunes, such as
Marty Stuart's "Little Things" and "Hillbilly Rock" and Merle Travis' "Smoke,
Smoke, Smoke.";   It's a band custom-made for clubs like the Saddle Rack,
where in fact they sometimes perform. But without some original material and
some tightening up, that's about the best they'll do.;   In contrast, when
Harris took the stage with the Nash Ramblers, it was a combination that meshed
beautifully. Harris has been performing for more than 20 years, and she still
has a soaring soprano virtually unmatched in country music. She sings with
such effortless joy, it seems as if she might go on another 20 years.;  
Despite a head of hair gone gray to betray her, Harris was disarmingly
youthful as she twirled about the stage in a beaded denim vest with a large
Harley Davidson patch on the back, long gauzy skirt and rhinestone studded
boots.;   Playing rhythm guitar, she led the band through 90 minutes and 21
songs worth of luscious ballads, contagious country and blistering bluegrass.;
  There were even some rock/pop numbers that benefited from an acoustic
make-over, such as Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Lodi" and Simon and
Garfunkel's "The Boxer.";   The real Emmylou; But it was such songs as "Hello
Stranger," "Beneath Still Waters," "Born to Run" and "Making Believe" that
made it a genuine Emmylou show, country/bluegrass blends that make you want to
order up one more beer and either drain it or cry in it.;   Some stars might
feel the need to remain the center of attention on stage, but not Harris. She
gave the band free rein, stepping back and turning them loose on such songs as
"Long Lost Soul." Huskey started the song, his right hand a blur as he slapped
the sound out of his bass. In fact, one of the best numbers of the evening
barely included Harris, instead featuring Bush on mandolin and Perkins on
dobro. Harris and the rest of the band stepped off stage, leaving the two to
use their instruments like small artillery, spitting bullets of sound to
Little Feat's "Sailing Shoes." It's a song Bush has been playing at concerts
for a while, and it probably won't get any better than the way it was played
Friday night. As the song segued into "Crossroads," the band began to
reassemble on stage, player by player. Harris reappeared in time to sing the
last refrain, as the medley slipped back into "Sailing Shoes.";   Harris kept
her encore to one song, the country classic "Together Again.";   "All I wanted
was to be the best," she had sung earlier.;   Rest assured, Emmylou.  </TEXT>
