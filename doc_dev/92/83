<LEADPARA>  THINK about it: You're a rock fan; someone who eats, drinks and breathes it.
You blast your eardrums out with it on a steady basis and worship any and
everything that your idol has written, worn or strummed. What fantasy gift
would you want to find under your tree on Christmas?;   How about a stage cape
worn by Elvis in 1972? Not one like it, but the cape itself, a cream-colored
number with brass studs and gold lame lining.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This hunka-hunka burnin' item and others like it go on the block at an
auction at Sotheby's in New York on Tuesday, where you could bid on them -- if
you could afford to go, and if you could afford the prices.;   As impressive
as the King's cape is (it is estimated to fetch between $5,000-$7,000), it is
but one of a number of rock offerings that the venerable auction house has up
for bid.;   One of the most expensive items is Jimi Hendrix's Les Paul guitar
($30,000-$40,000), while one of the least is an autographed copy of the "Born
to Run" album by Bruce Springsteen ($700-$900).;   Also to be had -- with a
subtle nod of head and punch of wallet -- are such goodies as Bill Haley's
first electric guitar ($25,000-$35,000); a set of handwritten Bob Dylan lyrics
from 1961 (those of "Talking New York" should fetch in the range of
$4,000-$5,000); an autographed copy of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"
signed by the Beatles ($1,000-$1,500); the passport of Billie Holiday
($3,000-$4,000); and loads of other rock memorabilia.;   The piece de
resistance -- depending on your predilections -- has to be the dress worn by
Madonna on the cover photo of her "Like a Virgin" album. It's a white tulle
ensemble replete with Boy Toy buckle and should go for $10,000-$12,000. Strap
that on for size!;   If by chance you are rich enough yourself to go -- or
lucky enough to have rich friends -- the auction is at 2 p.m. Tuesday.
Sotheby's is at 1334 York Ave., New York, (212) 606-7424. A catalog of the
sale is available at the auction house for $25. Admission is free (at least
something is).;   If all of this seems a bit much, but you've got a flaming
rock fan who must be placated, there is a video that might do the trick. "The
Beatles, The First U.S. Visit" (MPI Video) is an 85-minute video that
documents the group's initial foray to this country in February 1964. The
video comes with digitally re-mastered versions of the group's live
performances on the "Ed Sullivan Show" and its debut U.S. show in Washington,
D.C. Along the way, there's footage of the Beatles cavorting about in hotels
and trains; the antics of the Beatlemaniacs; and a wonderfully evocative sense
of that era. The video is $89.98, and the laserdisc is $39.98. Both are
available at all major record and video outlets. (box)  </TEXT>
