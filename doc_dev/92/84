MASTER GUITARIST TAL FARLOW IS STILL AT PEAK OF HIS FORM

Those who were aspiring guitarists in the '60s will remember those amazing 
catalogues for Gibson guitars. Printed on fine, heavy stock, with great color 
photos of the instruments, they were true Fantasyland for young pickers. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, one of the most expensive models was the "Tal Farlow," a big 
hollow-body electric designed strictly for jazz purists. But even with a guitar 
bearing his name, and as an unquestioned master of jazz guitar, Farlow never 
seemed to get the attention lavished on peers such as Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis 
and Joe Pass. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years later, Farlow, 68, is still at the peak of his form. He 
opened a two-week gig at Elario's on Wednesday, his first date in San Diego 
since he stopped here in the '50s with vibraphonist Red Norvo's trio. Farlow 
still plays the prototype for Gibson's "Tal Farlow." Not many jazz players get 
guitars named after them, but Farlow never let it go to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"They made these between 1962 and 1967," he said by phone from his home in Sea 
Bright, N.J. The humble guitarist's last album was "The Legendary Tal Farlow," 
a 1985 collection of wonderful jazz standards. The idea of a new recording just 
doesn't seem that important. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have definite plans as to just when I'm going to record," 
Farlow said. "I just don't care for that kind of thing." He'd rather play live, 
which he does often, especially in New York City, an easy drive from his home. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow may not seem like a revolutionary, but he was in the early days of jazz. 
When electric guitars first became widely available in the '40s, their 
potential to be heard elevated them from background rhythm-keeping to a solo 
instrument that could swing side by side with a horn section. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about Lester Young and Charlie Parker," Farlow remembers of his 
early days. "I'm pretty confident Charlie Christian was doing that too, 
thinking in terms of a horn, putting together single string solos, like a horn 
player. He and Lester Young were playing similar licks. When Charlie died, I 
started stealing licks from Lester, which were surprisingly at home on the 
guitar." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Farlow will be backed by Elario's house rhythm section of Bob 
Magnusson on bass and Jim Plank on drums. Without a piano, you can expect 
Farlow to function not only as the featured soloist, but as a chord-playing 
time keeper. This subtle mix, in Farlow's able hands, should produce some 
extremely bright musical moments. 
</P>
<P>
With the local club scene at an all-time low for jazz vocalists, San Diegans 
have to treasure their performances. 
</P>
<P>
Cath Eckert, one of the city's best jazz singers, plays one show only, this 
Sunday, July 9, 3 p.m., at Words &amp; Music Book Gallery in Hillcrest, in a 
duo with her husband, local jazz bassist Chris Conner. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, Eckert applies her smooth, throaty voice to standards, often drawn 
as much from popular music as from jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"One funny thing with my singing," Eckert said. "People always say I sound like 
the big-band singers, Anita O'Day, June Christie, but I never listened to them. 
I think maybe I sang with a big band in a past life. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyrics are important to me," she added. And she doesn't mind a little humor, 
like the songs of composer Dave Frishberg, once a member of the Baja Marimba 
Band. A sample: 
</P>
<P>
"You gripe and you groan/You grouse and you moan/You call Honolulu on my 
telephone." 
</P>
<P>
"If ever I'm in a new club," Eckert explained, "and the people are new to my 
music, I sing one of those and I have them right with me." 
</P>
<P>
With clubs booking so little vocal music, many of her performances are "casual" 
dates, like private parties and weddings. She supplements her jazz gigs by 
working weekends as a clown for hire for children's parties. 
</P>
<P>
She's performed with big names such as Freddie Hubbard and Joe Pass, and 
recently sang in a large Brazilian night club. 
</P>
<P>
"That sure was weird, a Canadian girl singing Brazilian tunes in Brazil. But 
they liked the way I sang." Eckert also plays Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach 
July 14 and 15. 
</P>

This is a week of activism for San Diego jazz musicians, who are putting their 
music behind their ideologies. Friday at 7:30 at the First Unitarian Church, 
4190 Front St., guitarist Peter Sprague plays a benefit for victims of the 
Alaskan oil spill. Saturday night at 8, same location, local pianist Randy 
Porter joins folk singer Peggy Watson and others at a benefit for the Central 
American Information Center, which wants to raise public consciousness about 
the violent war and destruction going on in El Salvador and other parts of 
Central America. The concert comes at the end of a 24-hour fast for peace in 
Central America. The organization hopes to raise $15,000 from sponsors of the 
fasters.

RIFFS: "Let's Get Lost," film maker Bruce Weber's powerful black-and-white 
documentary on trumpeter Chet Baker, continues through Saturday at the Ken 
Cinema. . . . The city of Carlsbad's summer jazz concert series continues 
Friday with Joy of Sax at 5:30 at Stagecoach Park off Mision Estancia, and July 
14 with flutist Holly Hofmann's quartet, same time, but at Magee Park on 
Carlsbad Boulevard, 3 blocks north of Elm. . . . A San Diego contingent 
including Mel Goot, Benny Holman, Ronnie Stewart, Oliver Luck and Ruby Bashore 
backed up blues greats King Solomon Burke and Sam Mayfield at the Monterey 
Blues Festival on June 24. San Diego trumpeter Ken Meredith is Burke's musical 
coordinator and plans to send the San Diegans to Europe with Burke later this 
summer. . . . On July 17 at 10 p.m. and July 21 at 11 p.m., KPBS-TV will air a 
program featuring a studio performance and interviews with five local jazz 
musicians who attended Crawford High School together in the '60s: Hollis 
Gentry, Carl Evans Jr., Nathan East, Marchelle Minafee and Doug Robinson.
