   Guitarist-singer George Benson returned to his
musical roots at the JVC Jazz Festival in a concert that emphasized
jazz and not the fusion that's made him so popular in recent years.
   The concert Sunday night at Carnegie Hall also featured pianists
Michel Camilo and McCoy Tyner.
   Benson, who has had big pop hits, also knows how to turn on the
jazz guitar, displaying a virtuosity and freshness.
   Camilo, from the Dominican Republic, is a percussive pianist,
who plays with excitement and joy. His new record album, ``On
Fire,'' is well-named.
   He announced his first tune, which he composed, as ``based on a
sugarcane field in the Caribbean; the joys and happiness of the
people.''
   With Camilo were bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond.
They were so tight that when a song changed mood or tempo, they all
shifted at exactly the same instant.
   Tyner, with bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott, played
the second set. Tyner, who was in John Coltrane's group early in
his career, also plays powerhouse, chordal piano. He has a rich,
full sound. ``Will You Still Be Mine?'' went on for 10 inventive
minutes, all of them interesting.
   Benson and Tyner made an album a year ago and Benson joined
Tyner's trio for its last two numbers before his own set.
   Benson used a cordless electric guitar and cordless microphone.
He played and scatted ``Breezin'.'' The first song he sang was the
bebop era's ``Moody's Mood for Love,'' which he did beautifully.
Benson radiates charisma. His singing is velvety and he projects an
individual personality.
   He, of course, sang the expected ``Everything Must Change,''
``On Broadway'' and ``This Masquerade.'' The audience enjoyed his
guitar playing on the instrumentals just as much.
   But the musician who took the greatest risk was Camilo, who
played a tribute to Art Tatum in Tatum's style and surprising his
audience by doing it so well.
   The JVC Jazz Festival opened Friday night and continues through
June 30. Originally the Newport Jazz Festival, it is now named
after its sponsor, a Japanese electronics firm.
