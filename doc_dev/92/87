   Stevie Ray Vaughan had all the makings of a blues
legend: a kid from Texas practicing the moves in front of a mirror;
overnight success; comparisons to Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King and Eric
Clapton; the last of the guitar heros playing his heart out.
   Only one part remained for Vaughan, 34, to complete the story,
join Hendrix, Robert Johnson, Mike Bloomfield and others by dying
young. Three years ago, he nearly did.
   ``This might sound funny, but fortunately I collapsed,'' said
Vaughan, who named his new album, ``In Step,'' after the ``12
Steps'' program used by recovering alcoholics.
   ``In a sense, I knew this thing was coming, I knew I couldn't
keep going the way it was. I had a nervous breakdown, I was throwing
up blood, the whole thing. I had not been able to obtain any drugs
for about two weeks, but the drinking was still going on. If I was
awake I was guzzling something,'' he said.
   ``We'd been touring, doing all kinds of things. I went through a
divorce; I couldn't write during that. I wanted to, but divorces are
sick. People don't treat people like people. Lawyers get together
and try to trick each other.''
   The first steps of ``12 Steps'' _ modesty, a sense of limits _
were once a million miles away for Vaughan. On and off stage, he
felt invincible, the baddest kid on the block.
   He could play anything, cover any song, and write his own as
well. From the swirling, Hendrix-like guitar that kicked off his
1983 debut album, ``Texas Flood,'' Vaughan was a sensation, a
throwback to rock's simpler days. Music magazines honored him, so
did the Grammys, making Vaughan an almost automatic nomination for
best rock instrumental.
   ``I didn't know what Grammys were growing up,'' he said. ``The
radio I listen to has more to do with soul stations that don't
necessarily play all the new stuff. I don't really care to get into
any formula: `If you play the game our way, we'll play your stuff.'
''
   Those first records, in every way, were a blur. Vaughan and his
band, Double Trouble, quickly followed his debut album with
``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' ``Soul to Soul'' and ``Live Alive,''
all gold sellers.
   Unafraid of comparisons, Vaughan covered Hendrix's ``Voodoo
Chile,'' Buddy Guy's ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' and Willie Dixon's
``You'll Be Mine.'' The slow songs _ Jimmy Reed's ``Tin Pan Alley,''
Vaughan's own ``Lenny'' _ were a release, temporary mercy, a long
sigh of relief.
   He lived and breathed the blues, and almost died.
   ``I thought I was real cool because I was higher than you and you
didn't know what you're missing. I was aware I had many big
problems, I could not stop and didn't know how,'' he said.
   ``I was addicted to people that I wasn't treating like people. I
was treating people like drugs, too. If there was somebody that
would put up with anything, that was fine. Luckily, there were
people who still cared.''
   Now preaching sobriety in his private life, Vaughan still
worships the blues on record. For ``In Step,'' he covers Howlin'
Wolf's ``Love Me Darlin','' Buddy Guy's ``Leave My Girl Alone,'' and
Willie Dixon's ``Let Me Love You Baby,'' drawing material from his
substantial record collection.
   ``They're like my books, like my school,'' Vaughan said. ``You
put it on and it hits you. It's always been that way.
   ``I can take just about any one of my records and if something
about the way they play or sing gets a hold of me, I'll try to find
what they did. I'll wrestle with myself playing their stuff for a
while and I'll absorb it into my own sound.''
   He ends ``In Step'' with ``Riviera Paradise,'' a lengthy jazz
instrumental he wrote in 1984.
   ``It's an extension of sorts of the same style as `Lenny.' In my
heart and in my mind, they were written for the same reason, to
soothe. It had to come out at the end of the record, I couldn't see
any other place for it, really.''
   Vaughan, who once dreamed of playing like bluesman Albert King,
now finds himself being approached by young guitarists, all just
beginning their own stories.
   ``Some of them want to know technical things, some of them want
to know what to do, how to go about getting a record deal. I can
just tell them who I listen to, what I did,'' he said.
   ``I remember when the biggest thing in my life was getting to
meet B.B. King. I thought, in my mind, it was not only important for
me, but important for him. I had all this confidence. It was
incredible seeing somebody who was such a gentleman. I've been so
fortunate to meet all these people.''
