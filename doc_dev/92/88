   When El Ultimo de la Fila goes on stage,
rock singer Manolo Garcia strikes the pose of a matador, flamenco
dancers swirl and stamp to the sound of electric guitars and
screaming fans surge forward.
   Although lead guitarist Quimi Portet says the group plays rock
music, the back-up acoustic guitar, castanets and wailing vocals
that have become its trademark are unmistakably and traditionally
Spanish.
   Spain is synonomous with music, but only recently has home-grown
rock 'n' roll moved to center stage as the country witnessed
explosive growth in bands, concerts and record companies in the
past decade.
   When Elvis Presley, Little Richard and the Beatles hit the music
scene, Spaniards were living under a military dictatorship. But the
death of authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975 and
Spain's transition to democracy provided the cultural and political
context within which local rock could flourish.
   Rock bands soon became blatantly ideological in their lyrics and
entertained at political rallies and municipal gatherings as the
music became a banner for a cultural and political reawakening
known as the ``movida'' _ the happening.
   ``I don't think what happened was a cultural renaissance, or
anything like that,'' said rock singer Anton Reixa, ``What happened
is that people all of a sudden returned to the way they had always
been. Madrid of the `movida' of the early '80s was like the Madrid
of Arniches, Madrid of the `zarzuelas,' but with spiked hair and
pop music.'' (Carlos Arniches was an early 20th-century composer
who wrote for music halls; zarzuelas are operettas based on popular
themes.)
   Early Spanish rock was little more than an imitation of British
and American music, but musicians gradually began to experiment,
fusing rock with traditional styles.
   This experimentation led to the birth of flamenco-rock. Such
Groups as Triana (a neighborhood in Seville), were a precursor to
El Ultimo (the last in line). ``Triana'' excited listeners in the
late '70s with their mixture of rock and Gypsy-inspired Andalusian
folklore.
   The legalization of Spain's regional languages following the
return to democracy opened the way for groups such as Os Resentidos
(the Resentful), a band from Galicia that mixes raunchy, distorted
sounds of electric guitar and synthesizers with bagpipe music
typical of Celtic Galicia in northwestern Spain.
   The group, which started in 1982, played one of its first gigs
in a psychiatric hospital. It now has its own music videos and
continues to occupy alternative music charts with a bagpipe-rap
version of its hit ``Galicia Sitio Distinto'' (``Galicia, a
Different Kind of Place'').
   Spain's rock movement has been especially active in the small
northern provinces of the restive Basque country, home to some of
the most radical rock and punk groups. Basque separatism and
political activism have spawned bands such as the Basque-language
Kortatu, with its highly politicized mixture of rock, reggae, punk
and occasional Basque accordion riffs.
   ``There are many more bands now than at the beginning of the
'80s,'' said Madrid disc jockey Chusma Martin. ``But now there is
no sense of direction.''
   Martin says many radical groups, Basque and otherwise, still
exist, but they are being overshadowed by a new generation of
apolitical bands that opt for a variety of styles.
   Aficionados of punk, new wave, heavy metal and rockabilly, each
in the appropriate attire, roam the streets of Madrid and the
plazas of small Castilian villages. American-style country music
also has made an considerable impression on Spanish bands.
   ``I`m really bothered by so much music with American country
references,'' said Reixa. ``There can't be country in Spain. I'm
fed up with songs that talk about Cadillacs and bourbon.''
   Manolo Garcia of El Ultimo says the group will not go American
in order to expand its market.
   Despite this uncompromising approach and an aversion to
marketing blitzes, El Ultimo performs before sell-out crowds in the
country of 39.8 million and boasts record sales in the hundreds of
thousands.
   Their latest LP, ``Como la Cabeza al Sombrero,'' recorded with
DPI, a small, independent company, has been released in France and
will soon be distributed in Scandinavia.
   But Spanish rock has not had much success abroad. ``Los Bravos''
topped the U.S. charts in the early '60s with their
English-language ``Black Is Black,'' but little else has gone
beyond the Spanish market since.
   Several Spanish pop groups have begun to look toward Latin
America as a logical source of fans and record sales, but few have
made it big.
   ``The exchange with Latin America is minimal,'' said Madrid disc
jockey Rosa Perez, ``Spanish independent companies are simply
incapable of exporting music in large quantities to Latin America''
where audiences tend to prefer ballad singers such as Julio
Iglesias or more traditional styles.
   But the technopop group ``Mecano'' is an exception to the rule
with more than 1 million records sold from Mexico to Tierra del
Fuego.
   Both ``Mecano'' and ``Hombres G'' are among the few Spanish
groups picked up by multinational recording companies.
   ``El Ultimo'' is just breaking ground in Latin America where
Garcia and Portet took their low-key promotional rock tour to
Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico in July.
   ``Here in Spain we were considered a weird group when we
started, and in certain respects we still are over there,'' said
Garcia. ``The process taking place there is similar to what
happened here four or five years ago _ one of surprise and then,
little by little, gradually acceptance.''
   In Southern California, Portet said, the organizers tried to
sell them as a Hispanic group. ``That's fine, but we make music for
people, not for specific groups.''
   Although Os Resentidos have made it in their native Galicia and
on alternative lists in the rest of Spain, their first album was
put out in Portugal because Galego and Portuguese are more similar
than Galego and Spanish.
   Reixa is not optimistic about success in Latin America. ``They
know us a little in Argentina, but inflation is so high there and
with the economic crisis it's impossible to sell records, to play,
to do anything. And in Colombia, they're almost on the verge of a
civil war.
   ``What cracks me up is that we're most popular in places where
there's a lot of turmoil.''
