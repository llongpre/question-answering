   ``Workers Playtime'' (Elektra) _ Billy Bragg
   
   Electric folkster Billy Bragg poses the question himself in this
record's signature tune, ``Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards'' _
``Mixing pop and politics he asks me what the use is, so I offer him
embarrassment and my usual excuses.''
   Excuses, hardly. What Billy Bragg has made is a record of
stinging social criticism, but with overtones of hope for humanity,
and even of love.
   ``Workers Playtime,'' with its hammer-and-sickle logo and
collective farm cover, looks like it should contain nothing but
tributes to Lenin and Marx. Bragg does sing of revolutions and
social injustice in his Cockney twang, but it's when he touches the
common emotions shared by all that he really hits home.
   On most tunes, Bragg strums an electric guitar backed by pianist
Cara Tivey, sometimes with a full band and sometimes not. He's
capable of spritely pop, such as ``She's Got a New Spell'' and ``The
Price I Pay,'' the latter a lament about a lost love in which Bragg
says he would ``walk a mile with a stone in my shoe'' to regain it.
   Relationships, and the trouble with keeping them intact, are the
subject of seven of the 11 songs. The best, ``Must I Paint You a
Picture,'' is a tender bass, piano and guitar piece in which Bragg
sings: ``The temptation - To take the precious things we have apart
- To see how they work - Must be resisted for they never fit
together again.''
   Bragg goes solo _ literally _ on the a cappella song ``Tender
Comrade,'' about a pair of army buddies trying to decide whether or
not they were really brave under fire. The strong lyrical content
makes instruments unnecessary.
   A pair of country tunes tackle completely different subjects. The
honky-tonk ``Life With the Lions'' deals with a man who hates what
his life has made him become, while ``Rotting on Remand'' is a
steel-guitar flavored tale of injustice that ends: ``You don't turn
criminals into citizens - By treating them this way.''
   The album ends with the rocking ``Waiting for the Great Leap
Forwards,'' featuring backing vocals by Michelle Shocked and Martin
Belmont on guitar, in which Bragg wonders whether things ever will
change in the world: ``In a perfect world we'd all sing in tune -But
this is reality so give me some room.''
   Billy Bragg's music is a delicate mixture of folk, rock and
country with some of the strongest lyrics this side of early Bob
Dylan. The album's leftist look shouldn't deter listeners from
finding the heart of gold inside.

   ``Reputation'' (Polydor) _ Brian Spence
   
   Drop the needle on ``Reputation,'' the first song on newcomer
Brian Spence's album, and you'll hear some burbling bass,
call-and-response vocals and a pleasant Daryl Hall imitation. Keep
the record going for the second song and you'll hear the same thing.
Virtually identical _ so much so you'll check your stereo for a
malfunction.
   Not a good sign for a new artist trying to establish his identity
in a competitive music scene. Spence's record is designed to fit
neatly on increasingly restrictive AOR (album oriented rock)
playlists.
   As such, it's paint-by-numbers rock devoid of personality. Except
for the clue of guitars tuned to sound vaguely like bagpipes, the
Edinburgh-born Spence could just as easily have been from Illinois
or California or Canada.
   There are a couple of breathy ballads to prove to women that
Spence is a sensitive guy. There's the roughhousing ``You Got the
Whip'' to prove to men he isn't. ``Reputation'' and ``Come Back
Home,'' the first two songs, are extremely radio friendly.
   This is all done with reasonable skill, although Spence is
annoyingly ungrammatical (learn the difference between your and
you're, Brian). It's the kind of record likely to be forgotten two
minutes after it's heard.

   Symphony No. 7, ``Leningrad,'' by Dmitri Shostakovich; Leningrad
Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mariss Jansons (EMI)
   
   In the era of glasnost, EMI brings us a quintessentially Russian
performance of Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, the ``Leningrad'' _
a work seized on by Soviet propagandists as a patriotic symbol. Its
first three movements were written in the summer of 1941 when Hitler
was marching on the composer's native Leningrad.
   But as the composer told Solomon Volkov in the book
``Testimony,'' ``It's not about Leningrad under siege, it's about
the Leningrad that Stalin destroyed and that Hitler merely finished
off.''
   There can't be much argument about this performance's
authenticity. Mariss Jansons, who studied with Yevgeni Mavrinsky,
the first conductor of many Shostakovich pieces, leads the
Leningraders in a wiry, lean performance. He paces nicely the first
movement march theme as it builds slowly from the fragile lyrical to
the clownish to the terrifying, supposedly symbolizing Hitler's
march on the city.
   The generally agile strings produce a slightly grainy sound when
called for, and the winds can produce a fine edge. Jansons is not
afraid to get ugly when that's appropriate.
   A caveat: the oboe has a somewhat cloying, over-vibratoed sound.
Balances in the winds are good. Overall, the orchestra sounds set
back on a stage, wih the listener somewhere in the middle of a large
hall.
   Speaking of halls, the only non-authentic aspect to this compact
disk is where it was recorded: the Konserthus in Oslo.
