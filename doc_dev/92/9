   Twenty years after his death, legendary
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix still packs 'em in.
   They don't come in large numbers at any one time, but they come.
Some bring guitars, some bring flowers. Visitors might spend a
little time at his grave, strumming tunes.
   ``The crowds here have mellowed a bit, as has the mood of the
country,'' said Hank Kerns, general manager of Greenwood Memorial
Park, where Hendrix is buried.
   ``Once in a while they'll leave a beer can, but we're careful to
get it picked up right away.''
   Kerns said the number of visitors to Hendrix's grave has
increased during the past few years, and the Goodwill Games brought
more than usual. One national magazine, he said, listed visiting
the gravesite as one of the things to do in Seattle while attending
the international athletic contest.
   Hendrix died in London on Sept. 18, 1970. According to coroner's
records, he died when he choked on his vomit. A non-lethal amount
of barbituate drugs was found in his system.
   ``Forever in our hearts,'' reads his headstone, which includes
an electric guitar carved in bas-relief. There is little to
indicate he was the king of acid rock, but by the time of his death
at age 27 he had forged a lasting legacy.
   ``I heard he was buried around here. I needed to make the
pilgrimage,'' Peg Wood said Sunday during a visit to the cemetery.
   The 26-year-old recently moved to Seattle from Illinois to begin
an internship with the Veterans Administration as she pursues a
Ph.D. in psychology. Her ``other life'' is playing rock guitar.
   ``My parents named me Peggy Sue, for God's sake. I was destined
for a life of decadent rock 'n' roll,'' she said, laughing.
   Hendrix, who grew up in Seattle's predominantly black Central
Area, was about 14 when he talked his father into buying him a $5
used guitar, according to Al Hendrix.
   ``He wore that thing out,'' the father said. ``Later on I got
him his first electric guitar and I got a sax. I didn't know much
about the sax and he didn't know much about the guitar. So we'd
make quite a bit of noise.''
   At first, the young Hendrix was content to play along with
recordings of blues greats B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
   ``So I told him, `Come up with something original,' and he
did,'' recalled Al Hendrix. ``The first time I heard `Are You
Experienced?' (the first Jimi Hendrix Experience album), it was
something altogether different than what I was used to listening
to.''
   It didn't take long for the elder Hendrix to become one of his
son's biggest fans. Innovative, sometimes outrageous and blaring
with his music, Jimi was quiet and unassuming offstage, his father
said.
   Al Hendrix still goes to his son's grave about once a month,
still gets a kick out of recalling the times he has found fans
sitting around the grave with guitars in hand.
   Fans frequently leave small items. Peg Wood added a guitar pick
to the collection there.
   ``He was the most inventive guitar player I ever heard,'' she
said. ``I like the blues. But I felt he rewrote them. He changed
the rules so that there weren't any rules. He freed me up.''
