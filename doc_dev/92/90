   Henry Goldrich is the guy who told Harry Chapin
that ``Taxi'' ran too long to be a hit. He's also the guy who
kicked George Benson out of his store because of that annoying
guitar.
   ``Back in the '60s, I told Paul (Simon) that Simon and Garfunkel
was a lousy name. And I still think it is,'' says Goldrich.
   Fortunately, musicians want instruments and not advice from
Goldrich _ which is why his music store, Manny's on West 48th
Street, has served everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Guns N' Roses
in the past five decades.
   The Beatles invaded Manny's before they did the rest of country;
these days, Sean Lennon buys his guitars there. Mick Jagger was
looking for the right ax for this year's Stones' tour when he ran
into Bo Diddley. David Johansen has been a customer since he was a
New York Doll; he visits now as Buster Poindexter.
   ``The Who _ when they were in town, doing the show _ they were
in here. Except Daltrey. He bought a guitar once and never played
it,'' says Goldrich, dropping names as fast as Clapton works a fret
board. ``They came to my son's bar mitzvah; flew over. They're
friends.''
   Goldrich, a gray-haired, bearded man with a slight pot belly, is
the son of the original Manny and current keeper of the family
business. His dad established the store in Harlem 54 years ago, and
they became a 48th Street fixture in the late 1940s. The musicians
followed and never left.
   ``It's word of mouth. We have a very long and great
reputation,'' says Goldrich, whose earliest recollections of the
store involve a nodding John Coltrane asleep on an upstairs couch.
   Manny's customer list reads like a history of American music:
Charlie Parker in the '40s; Buddy Holly in the '50s; Jimi Hendrix
in the '60s; Paul Simon in the '70s; David Byrne in the '80s. Most
have provided autographed pictures, an invaluable collection that
covers the walls of the stores.
   ``Elvis Presley is the only big rock star who never walked in
the store. ... We delivered stuff to his hotel,'' says Goldrich.
   Manny's and Rudy's Music Stop across the street still cater to
the big names, but most of their old neighbors are gone. There were
once 25 music stores along the strip that comprised the Big Apple's
bandstand. Today, a half-dozen remain, the rest replaced by the
westward creep of Rockefeller Center and the eastern move of
grocery stores and fast-food joints.
   Such intrusions don't mean the area has lost its magnetism for
musicians, who still pass through midtown construction and the
surrounding porno shops to check out what's what.
   ``Go to West 48th Street to look at all the guitars and amps. Go
to Manny's and Rudy's. Look at all the great new equipment. That's
my idea of a good time,'' Lou Reed told Rolling Stone. Most
musicians heed his advice.
   Guns N' Roses featured the store in their video for ``Paradise
City.'' Soviet rock star Boris Grebenshikov hit the 48th Street
shops shortly after arriving in the United States to examine the
merger of music and capitalism. And then there's the time Mark
Knopfler turned a salesman into a sideman at Rudy's Music Stop.
   Part-time Rudy's worker Jack Sonni met Knopfler through the
shop, which the Dire Straits leader began frequenting in 1979. Five
years later, Sonni signed on with Dire Straits for the ``Brothers
in Arms'' LP after getting a surprise invite from Knopfler.
   At least Sonni knew who Knopfler was. When Guns N' Roses
guitarists Izzy Stradlin and Slash showed up at Manny's, Goldrich
didn't have a clue as to their identities.
   ``The music now is very heavy metal, which is not my favorite.
You can't whistle it,'' said Goldrich _ Itzhak Perlman is his kind
of musician. ``But the kids _ they're probably just as nice.''
   When Goldrich started in the business, the musicians were as
hard up for cash as the struggling Manny. A day's receipts could
total $18; many of the musicians bought on credit and took a long
time to pay, he says.
   ``Charlie Parker used to come in and play tenor sax, and
Gillespie played piano, and we used to have the greatest jam
sessions in the world,'' Goldrich recalled. ``Coltrane (tenor and
soprano saxophone) was there. Coltrane _ there's guy that owed me a
lot of money.''
   Goldrich is understandably proud of the autographed pictures
that line his store. On a small portion of one wall, The Who, the
Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Bob Dylan
sit side by side.
   ``Keep one eye closed at all cost,'' advised Dylan on his
picture.
   Goldrich himself is a one-man rock 'n' roll repository. He sold
guitars for Hendrix's and Holly's families after their deaths. His
friends include Ella Fitzgerald, John Entwistle and James Taylor.
   And he has a bit of advice _ good advice, for once _ for anybody
hoping to open a place on 48th Street.
   ``When somebody walks in the store that's famous, I think they
get worse treatment than the standard customer,'' said Goldrich.
``We're not on them constantly. ... They come in here, they wander
through the store. I don't go in awe of these guys.''
