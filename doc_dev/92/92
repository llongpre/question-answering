Whatever else you have heard about the harmolodic theory of jazz - the
mention of it can still bring jazz buffs to blows - Ornette Coleman's
agitato ensemble playing leaves an indelible mark on the musical memory. His
technique, pioneered in the 1950s, has influenced musicians ever since. The
term he invented for group improvisation, where each musician is in a
different key, stands for harmony, movement and melody. All instruments play
an equal but leading role and each works independently: but towards the same
colourful end.
The Prime Time band which has executed this theory since 1975 has
traditionally employed a double (electric) rhythm section to beat the
message home. On this tour, the band featured a keyboard player (David
Bryant) and tablas (Badal Roy) in addition to electric bass (Al McDowell),
two guitars (Kenny Wessel and Chris Rosenberg) and son Denardo Coleman on
drums. The resulting new sound is no less challenging - the alternate
meshing and colliding of instruments is still there - but with more spaces
between. The movement (much of it provided by Denardo's demonic drumming) is
as energetic but more approaches are made to melody and harmony than
hitherto.
The guitars and piano are often used to introduce a piece, working at a
melody until Ornette appears on alto or tenor sax to chase it away with a
wonderful blizzard of notes. In one number - there are no introductions -
Chris Rosenberg picked out what sounded like Bach's cello Suite No. 1 for
several minutes until Denardo came hammering across him with an industrial
samba, Ornette hard on his heels with an almost straight calypso solo.
While the keyboards provide an extra melodic dimension, the clack and bong
percussion of Badal Roy's tablas add excitement and colour to the new group.
The guitarists twitch and also play a kind of funk with the wah wah; the
bass rumbles menacingly in McDowell's hands (and ultimately in Denardo's
when the two swap jobs). Scribbling serenely among this controlled anarchy
on saxophones or trumpet, resplendent in a suit apparently made from cooking
foil, which dazzles under the spotlight, is Ornette.
Thirty years after he dropped harmolodics on to an unsuspecting New York
scene, the sight and sound of Ornette Coleman with the alto is still
contemporary, modern and artistic. His most recent work is on the soundtrack
for Cronenberg's Naked Lunch (Milan/BMG), recorded with the London Symphony
Orchestra 'without order, sequence, key or strict tempo'. Seated and sawing
frenziedly at the electric violin in front of Prime Time he remains fresh,
vital and often baffling.
