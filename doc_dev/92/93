The world's first rock seance was a partial success, promoter Loni Specter 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, held at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, was intended to lure the 
spirits of deceased guitarists Jim Hendrix, Duane Allman and others into making 
guest appearances at the L.A. Guitar Show. 
</P>
<P>
There was some controversy. One medium refused to preside because, he said, the 
late John Lennon had advised him he was upset at the commercialization of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
During the seance, two spectators said they felt Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix 
speaking through them. But the spirits of the late guitarists left their 
instruments home. No otherworldly rock music was heard. Perhaps the spirits 
refused to play out of sympathy with the musicians on strike in Las Vegas.
