   Like any proud parents, Len and Debra
Bonamassa will whip out the pictures of their 13-year-old son,
Joey, at the drop of a hat.
   But don't look for photos of little Joey taking his first step
or standing at attention in a Cub Scouts uniform.
   Instead, you'll see Joey on stage at a Hollywood nightclub with
pop artist Stephen Stills, or backstage at the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center with Stills, Graham Nash and David Crosby or chatting
with blues great B.B. King.
   When the Bonamassas talk about wanting to limit how much their
son plays, they mean in nightclubs, not Nintendo. And their home
movies are apt to be a promotional video for Joey, whose reputation
as a blues guitar prodigy is growing.
   He's been working professionally for two years, since the night
he sat in with blues singer and harmonica player James Cotton in a
nightclub in Hamilton, N.Y. Joey has since opened for B.B. King and
jammed with some of the country's best blues guitarists, including
Buddy Guy, Ronnie Earl and Albert Collins.
   ``It's just the same as if you go up there with your own band,''
said Joey. ``It's really no different. You're just playing with
another fellow musician.''
   Len Bonamassa, echoing the critics who've caught his son's act,
says Joey plays the blues with ``maturity and heart and soul'' far
beyond his years. Audiences, perhaps skeptical at first of an
eighth-grader in snakeskin boots who styles himself ``Smokin' Joe''
on stage, are won over from the first notes he plays.
   ``He's definitely going to be a monster guitar player,'' said
Robert Dye of Guitar World magazine, who caught Joey's act recently
at a New York City club. ``He's got feel beyond his years. ... He's
managed to capture the feel of players in their late 30s or early
40s.''
   Yet, sitting at the kitchen table of the Bonamassa's ranch house
in this quiet, working-class suburb of Utica, Joey looks no
different than any other eighth-grader. As the family dog barks up
a storm in the garage, Joey asks his mother for a cookie but gets a
pretzel instead. He talks about cars with his father and about the
local high school's champion sports teams.
   In all ways, his parents say, Joey is an average 13-year-old.
Except when he has a guitar in his hands.
   ``By the time he was 6, he was sounding like something. By the
time he was 7, he was about as good as most guitar players in this
area,'' said Len, himself once a member of a duo that played Top 40
songs in local lounges. ``He was able to pull off Stevie Ray
Vaughan note for note at 7 years old.''
   With his father initially giving him pointers, Joey learned to
play on a scaled-down electric guitar. He said he still practices
about an hour and a half a day, more on weekends and during the
summer.
   About the only formal training Joey has had was with a local
jazz guitarist who admitted to his parents that while he enjoyed
playing with their son, he couldn't really teach him anything.
   Joey first got to meet and perform with the prominent blues
performers appearing in central New York through his father's
contacts with club owners and musicians. Now he has made enough of
a name to perform on his own at nightclubs and music festivals,
backed by a band of adult professionals put together with the help
of his father.
   His repertoire includes rocking blues songs made famous by
Vaughan, Jimi Hendricks, Muddy Waters and others.
   Len Bonamassa said he is now looking for a big-time agent to
handle his son's bookings and publicity. ``He's ready for some
professional hands,'' said Len, a truck driver for a paper
distributor. ``It's just too much for Mom and Dad.''
   Something about the rhythm of the blues songs he heard as a
child on his father's Vaughan and Allman Brothers records appealed
to him, Joey says. While most kids his age are listening to M.C.
Hammer or Metallica, he continues to mine the work of blues-based
guitarists including Roy Buchanan, Danny Gatton, Collins, Stills
and Earl for influences.
   ``They're all in their own little world of heavy metal and
rap,'' he says of his schoolmates. ``I just want to play the
blues.''
   So far, except for occasionally singing ``Johnny B. Goode,''
Joey has limited his performing to playing the guitar.
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable playing,'' he said. ``Singing is
something I do because if you don't sing it really isn't marketable
for a blues guitar players. But Daddy says, `Why don't you sing a
few tunes just to let them know you can sing?' So I do, but it's
not the greatest voice in the world.''
