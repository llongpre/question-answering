<LEADPARA>  WHAT is it about Georgia when it comes to music? Maybe it's the humidity
bending all those guitar strings and guitarists' minds, or a century-old
nervous tic left over from that damn Yankee Sherman's march that's left
everyone kind of tetched in the noggin.;    Whatever it is, in the past 20
years, the state has given rock a dizzying array of music: the chicken-fried
redneck rock of the Allman Brothers; the daffy kitsch of the B-52's; the
retro-folk-rock of R.E.M.; the rollicking rock of the Black Crowes; and
weirdest of all, the folk of Indigo Girls.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Weird, not in any odd way; but in the sense that, in this day of glitzy,
hi-tech commercial music, folk just should not go.;    But in the case of
Indigo Girls, it has. With the eponymous major-label debut in 1988, the duo of
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk
Recording and were nominated in the Best New Artist category. And, in
subsequent years, the Indigo Girls have recorded and toured to acclaim and
adulation (their new tour heads into the University of California, Berkeley
Greek Theater tonight).;    But what about that eclectic Georgia scene?;    "I
think there's a different feel in Atlanta, and the whole state, from New York
or Los Angeles," Ray says by phone from Denver. "The record labels aren't
there and there isn't a lot of competition between the bands. It's a very
unified scene. Everyone plays a lot and are very giving to each other. There
is an unspoken union of the groups; they want to help each other out and they
all tour and give each other opportunities. We're all underdogs but none of us
have a chip on our shoulder.";    But even given the popularity of the state's
scene, it is remarkable that the Indigo Girls have not only prospered but
flourished on the national level. Their folk-based songs are idiosyncratic,
teasing and witty, but with a dark edge. It isn't the sort of music that
conforms to any of the prevailing commercial parameters.;    "We had been
recording independently awhile before we got the Epic contract," Ray says. "We
weren't totally bent about getting a contract. We thought, 'We won't be bombed
if we don't.' When we did we were pretty much surprised about that and the
Grammy.";    While they made their debut with "Crazy Game" in 1985 on their
own Indigo label, their "career" had been on line for a long time. Ray and
Saliers first met in sixth grade in their old hometown of Decatur, Ga. -- not
just as friends, but as musicians.;    "Emily had started playing in fourth
grade and I started in fifth," Ray says. "And we just hit it off.";    At the
time, Ray, now 27, was listening to such rockers as Elton John, the Eagles,
Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and "the Partridge Family. I just couldn't
seem to get away from them," she says with a chuckle.;    "I didn't really get
into punk at the time that it came out," she says. "But when I did listen to
it, it made me freer and I really liked its passion. I also really liked the
Roches. They were so weird, sort of folk punk. That's what some people have
called us.";    And what would she call Indigo Girls?;    "I don't know.
Acoustic-blah-whatever.";    But on the 1990 album
"Nomads(*)Indians(*)Saints," Ray and Saliers departed substantially from their
acoustic-based sound. There were electric guitars and drums and bass and the
duo was joined by the likes of R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and Benmont Tench of the
Heartbreakers. One of the album's songs, "The Girl With the Weight of the
World in Her Hands," even came with a section of strings.;    "It was exciting
using the strings," Ray says. "But it's not like we want to have more and more
instruments on every new record. We just thought that strings were right in
that case.";    The Indigo's new EP, "Live, Back On The Bus, Y'all," is mostly
made up of Ray and Saliers performing, not as a duo, but with various groups.;
   "The new record is deceiving," Ray says. "It was a slice of life, a
document of a part of our tour. We usually do part of our shows with the group
and about 10 songs acoustically, with a bass.;    "I don't know why we did
that. We're not very calculated about those things. We do things but we don't
think about them. But the record company probably thought the group songs were
more commercial.";    While Ray doesn't mind playing with a group, she says
that "it's not really me. Emily likes the other instruments but if I was doing
a solo album it would just be me and an acoustic guitar. I think I could focus
more passion into the songs that way.";    Ray won't really say how the duo's
new songs might be recorded when the Indigo's make their way back to a studio
for their next album in November. "Most of the new songs are agricultural and
about the land," she says. "They deal with very abstract, sensual images
instead of a more concrete feel," she says. "But I don't know what we're going
to do with them until we do them. That's just the way we do what we do.";
