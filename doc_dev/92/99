   The Who just can't stop talking about their
generation.
   The legendary British rock group plans to celebrate their
founding 25 years ago with their first tour in more than six years.
   ``We felt like we weren't trying to resurrect the band. This is
a celebration of the music we created, after all these years,''
lead singer Roger Daltrey said Monday.
   Daltrey joined composer-guitarist Peter Townshend and bassist
John Entwistle in announcing the planned tour of 25 North American
cities this summer. It will be their first since a ``Farewell
Tour'' of 1982-83.
   The band rode to fame a generation ago with the hit ``My
Generation,'' a teen-protest song that included the line, ``Hope I
die before I get old.''
   They're now in their 40s, with Townshend acknowledging he has
impaired hearing. And they haven't played together since a brief,
rusty appearance at Live Aid in 1985.
   Does the band's chemistry still exist?
   ``We don't know whether it's still there or what it is or where
it comes from. We're going to get in the rehearsal studio and see
what happens,'' Townshend said.
   Drummer Simon Phillips will join the group, and there also will
be a keyboardist, horn player, percussion section and backup
singers. The original Who drummer, Keith Moon, died in 1978.
   The tour will include two full-length performances of the rock
opera ``Tommy,'' with guest stars, in New York City and Los
Angeles. The latter concert will be videotaped. Proceeds from those
concerts and the video will benefit the Nordoff-Robbins Music
Therapy Foundation for autistic children.
   The band last performed ``Tommy,'' by Townshend, in its entirety
17 years ago in Chicago.
   The Who will play concerts with an intermission for the first
time. ``I don't know if that says anything about age,'' said
Townshend, 43. The band will play at least three hours, performing
music from the group's albums as well as the artists' solo efforts.
   Daltrey said they had decided against making an album to be
released while they're touring.
   ``One of the reasons we stopped is we were on that
album-tour-album-tour rat race of the rock 'n' roll industry. To
come back and do all that again we thought was a mistake,'' he said.
   Of his hearing problem, Townshend said: ``It's a ringing in the
ears at the kind of frequencies at which I play the guitar. ... If
I expose myself to loud electric guitar, particularly my own, my
hearing suffers.''
   ``I'm still very nervous about how I can work on stage without
further damage to my hearing,'' he said, but then drew a laugh by
adding: ``We're going to play very, very quietly.''
