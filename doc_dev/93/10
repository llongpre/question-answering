  [Text] Bonn, February 4--The Indian government is 
"seriously considering" doing away with the situation that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category, 
as part of ongoing liberalisation process, UNI reports. 
  This has been conveyed by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, in the Indian government's reply to the "Kohl 
memorandum" sent to New Delhi after the German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl's visit to India in February last year. 
  The memorandum, entitled `Proposals on Economic Policies and 
Procedures of the Government of India', was forwarded by the 
Chancellor in July last year. 
  Some of the other proposals for further liberalisation, made 
in the memorandum and under active consideration of the 
government, are: 
  --Liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry; 
  --Removal of the phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy; 
  --Increasing the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations; 
  --Amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act. 
  The government's reply to the memorandum also states that on 
some other issues, such as enforceability of foreign awards, the 
government had an "open mind" and was willing to consider the 
matter. 
  The Indian reply to the memorandum was given to the German 
government a few days before Mr Rao's arrival on a state visit 
here. 
  The Indian reply states that it must be appreciated as a 
fundamental point relating to the issues raised in the "Kohl 
memorandum" that since the process of reforms was initiated 
several policy changes had been progressively made and 
procedures increasingly streamlined to improve the business 
environment in the country. 
  The reply adds that several of the proposals made in the 
memorandum were already under implementation. They were 
identified as: 
  --To decrease the number of industries reserved for the 
public sector; 
  --Faster clearance for applications under the EPCG [Export 
Promotion Capital Goods] scheme; 
  --Negotiation of more favourable double-taxation agreement; 
  --More liberal procedures for payment of foreign 
technicians; 
  --Long duration purchase agreements for power and secured 
fuel supplies for such projects; 
  --Equal opportunities for manufacturers in the telecom 
sector. 
  Under six broad classifications, the memorandum put forward 
suggestions on a vast range of areas and subjects such as 
desirability of a "negative" list; speeding up of state 
governments' proposals; uniform industrial policy in the states; 
remittance facilities for foreign nationals; disinvestment 
procedures; and governing law and arbitration for contracts 
entered into with foreign parties. 
  PTI adds: Leading political parties in Germany 
have assured India that the new `Asia concept' unveiled by the 
Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, with India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation and embracing a wide range of 
fields, would be honoured irrespective of which party came to 
power in this year's elections there. 
  This assurance was conveyed to Mr Rao, when a series of 
important German political leaders called on him here yesterday. 
  An official spokesman said that by and large there was "a 
multi-party support" to Dr Kohl's new `Asia concept', as Germany 
has willingly recognised that Japan, China and India in Asia 
would be the important political and economic powers in the 
coming years. 
  The important German leaders who called on Mr Rao included 
Mr 
Hans Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of 
Socialist Democratic Party, Dr Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Party, and 
Dr Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of Free Democratic Party. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Rao reached the historic city of Berlin this 
afternoon on the last leg of his six-day tour to Davos and 
Germany. 
  Mr Rao is scheduled to meet the German President, Mr Richard 
von Weizsaecker, besides opening the cultural festival programme 
at the Indian cultural centre there tomorrow.
