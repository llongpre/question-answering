FT  10 MAR 94 / Dalai Lama attacks Beijing

The Dalai Lama yesterday attacked China for paying 'lip service' to his
attempts to negotiate on the future of Tibet and said Tibetans might have to
adopt a new approach to their freedom struggle.
The exiled leader's statement, issued from his home in Dharamsala, India, is
likely to increase tension during this week's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state.
Tibet is among the human rights issues on which the US is demanding progress
before China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status is renewed this
year.
The Dalai Lama said he had 'left no stone unturned' in seeking an agreement
on the basis of a statement in 1979 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's leader,
that 'except for independence of Tibet, all other questions can be
negotiated'. But Beijing had repeatedly rejected his overtures.
He said: 'I must now recognise that my approach has failed to produce any
progress either for substantive negotiations or in contributing to the
overall improvement of the situation in Tibet.'
The Dalai Lama acknowledged that his failure to press for complete
independence had disappointed many Tibetans.
He said conditions in Tibet had worsened dramatically with increased
suppression and marginalisation of Tibetans and the destruction of culture
and the environment.
