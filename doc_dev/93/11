   Rajiv Gandhi comes to China Monday for the first
visit by an Indian prime minister since his grandfather, Jawalharlal
Nehru, made the trip 34 years ago.
   For Gandhi's nation and his political future, the stakes appear
high. For China, little seemingly can go wrong.
   During a week long on symbolism but short on substance, Gandhi
will be feted in the capital, tour the ancient city of Xian and
visit Shanghai.
   The visit, Gandhi recently said, will be ``very important ... for
this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations _ the world's most populous _ will probably sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology, Indian and Western diplomats said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. China and India also may agree to establish consular
offices.
   But no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of
their 2,400-mile border, over which the two countries fought a brief
war in 1962.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress. China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian territory.
India rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200
square miles it took in the 1962 war.
   Since then, relations have improved, but only slightly. The
border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade,
which resumed in 1977 but amounted to only $150 million last year,
is limited.
   Both China and India say Gandhi's visit is intended to create an
atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border
question. But Western diplomats said pressures on Gandhi could make
him more willing to compromise than his Chinese counterparts.
   China is moving quickly to improve relations with the Soviet
Union after nearly three decades of hostility. A summit between
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping may be held next year.
   Better Chinese-Soviet relations will eliminate Moscow's need to
cultivate New Dehli as a foil against Beijing. And by removing
tensions along its northern border, China will be under less
pressure to accomodate India on its southern flank.
   China continues its close relationship with Pakistan, India's
traditional enemy. Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, is
expected to visit China in January on her first official trip abroad.
   ``For Gandhi, the whole visit has an air of him running along so
he doesn't get left out in the cold,'' said a Western diplomat in
Beijing who recently returned from New Delhi. ``For the Chinese, the
visit can't possibly go wrong.''
   A society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign
affairs, China has watched with apparent enjoyment as the Indian
press has pressured Gandhi to make progress on the border issue,
Western diplomats said.
   ``The prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to
his travel bags,'' wrote the normally pro-government Times of India
in an editorial Wednesday. ``The more important question, however,
is, what is the prime minister going to China for?''
   Gandhi also faces an election next year in which victory is far
from certain. Diplomats say he must convince his public that simply
establishing goodwill with the Chinese _ and not achieving a
dramatic breakthrough _ is a worthy goal.
   ``If he feels that he is failing at that, he might be persuaded
to do something rash,'' the Western diplomat said.
   India could use the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader who has
taken refuge in India since 1959, to embarrass the Chinese. The
Tibetan refugees' parliament-in-exile on Friday called on Gandhi to
raise the issue of Tibet with Chinese leaders.
   But India's hand is weakened by China's apparent willingness to
crush dissent in Tibet, regardless of international opinion. On Dec.
10, police shot and killed at least one monk in Lhasa, the capital
of Tibet, during an anti-Chinese demonstration. In addition, New
Delhi also has backed China's claims to the region.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
China in the early 1950s. Relations soured in the early 1960s over
the border question and political disagreements.
   Relations improved slightly in the late 1970s. China invited an
Indian leader to visit as early as 1979, but India agreed to come
only in November of last year.
   Western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was
significant because it came well after Sino-Soviet relations had
begun to improve.
