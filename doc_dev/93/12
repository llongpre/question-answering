   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their
troubled border, the main issue dividing the world's most populous
nations, Indian journalists said.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet and trade with his Chinese hosts.
   Gandhi and China's premier, Li Peng, met for two hours in the
morning following Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi. They continued
meetings after lunch, said the journalists who attended a news
briefing closed to non-Indian reporters.
   Gandhi's five-day visit marks the first time an Indian leader has
come to China since 1954, when his grandfather Jawalharlal Nehru
came to Beijing.
   The last time Chinese and Indian leaders met was in 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. Two years later, India and
China fought a war over the border and China occupied a large chunk
of Indian territory.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing accompanied by about 100 top officials
and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology.
   Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   Little progress was expected on the 2,400-mile border.
   China's Xinhua News Agency and Indian journalists said Gandhi and
Li agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the
border question peacefully.
   ``We should work now toward resolution of the border issue while
we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral
relations,'' the journalists quoted Gandhi as saying.
   Li said the border problem was hindering the two countries'
relations, Xinhua reported.
   Xinhua also said Li expressed ``admiration'' for India's position
on Tibet, a Chinese province bordering India.
   India has reiterated that Tibet is part of China and forbids
Tibetan refugees in India from engaging in political activities. In
1959, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's leader, and thousands of Tibetan
refugees fled to India after an abortive, anti-Chinese uprising.
   On Dec. 10, at least one monk was killed in the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa during a clash between Chinese troops and Tibetans who seek
an end to 38 years of Chinese rule. It was the third bloody clash in
Lhasa in 14 months.
   Earlier Monday, at the Great Hall of the People in downtown
Beijing, Gandhi was given a 19-gun salute and met by Premier LI.
   Indian and Chinese flags lined Tiananmen Square, colored flags
lined the city's main boulevard, Changanjie.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and personal
and political disagreements between Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and
Prime Minister Nehru.
   China now claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India
rejects the claim and demands that China return the 15,200 square
miles it took in the war.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations instead of
exporting socialist revolution.
   Direct trade resumed in 1977 but it amounted to just $150 million
in 1986-87 with few prospects for growth.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little
progress in eight rounds.
   Interviews with Chinese scholars over the weekend found them
pessimistic about the possibility for good Sino-Indian ties. For
one, they said, the economies of the two countries are too similar
to allow for much trade.
   ``They export textiles and we export textiles. They want high
technology and we want high technology,'' said Zhang Minqiu, deputy
director of the Institute of South and Southeast Asian Studies at
Beijing University. ``We're competitors so we lack cooperative
spirit.''
   In addition, Chinese researchers said the border question appears
intractable.
   ``In some of the areas that we claim, the Indian government has
made big investments and has registered good economic growth,'' said
Ms. Zhang. ``It's very hard to see them giving it up.''
