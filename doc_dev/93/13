   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping agreed today to restore friendly ties between
the world's most populous countries despite a long-standing border
dispute.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old senior Chinese
leader said to Gandhi, 44, as the two leaders met in the Great Hall
of the People.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' Deng said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   ``I agree and would like to thank you for your warm welcome,''
Gandhi said.
   Deng said he knew Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, who
came to China in 1954, the last Indian prime minister to do so.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between, there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' Deng said. ``But let us forget it.
We should be looking forward.''
   Later at a speech at presitigious Qinghua University, Gandhi
summed up the goal of his five-day trip.
   ``I have every hope that during this visit we will, together with
our Chinese friends, build a better political climate for the
solution of the border issue,'' he said.
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   ``I am heartened that the Chinese leadership is more than
prepared to put behind us past rancor and past prejudices,'' Gandhi
said. ``I am heartened that we are both prepared not to be mired in
the past.''
   Chinese-Indian relations were good in the 1950s but a boundary
dispute led the two countries into war in 1962.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. India rejects
the claim and demands China return the 15,200 square miles it took
in the 1962 war.
   During Gandhi's visit, China and India are expected to sign
agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and
technology. Consular offices in Shanghai and Bombay may also be
established.
   Little progress is expected on the border.
   Gandhi arrived in Beijing on Monday and spent most of the day
meeting with Premier Li Peng. His visit marked the first time Indian
and Chinese leaders have met since 1960, when then-Premier Chou
Enlai went to New Delhi.
   Gandhi and Li discussed the border problem and Gandhi called for
a renewal of friendship between the two nations.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at a
banquet Monday night. ``It is now time to look forward to the
future. It is now time to restore the relationship between our two
countries.''
   In the past, India has said it would only improve bilateral ties
once progress was made on the border.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict
with his Chinese hosts in talks his official spokesman described as
``warm, cordial and very friendly.''
   On Tuesday, Gandhi met with China's president, Yang Shangkun, and
again talked about China's troubled region of Tibet.
   Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's internal
affairs. The issue is sensitive because Tibet's spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, fled to India in 1959 after an abortive,
anti-Chinese uprising.
   Gandhi was to meet tonight with Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, he is to fly to the
ancient city of Xian and Friday he will go to Shanghai.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements.
   Relations began to improve in the late 1979s but the border
remains heavily guarded. The two countries began border talks in
1981 but have made little progress in eight rounds, the last of
which was held in November 1987.
   China has more than 1 billion people. India, the world's largest
democracy, has a population of about 800 million.
