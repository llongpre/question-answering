  [Text] Bonn, February 3--The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut 
Kohl, today assured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
that his country would do everything in its power to boost 
industrial and technological co-operation with India and 
announced that a high-level Indo-German commission on science 
and technology would be set up soon, report PTI and UNI. 
  Addressing the Indo-German economic conference along with Mr 
Rao, the German Chancellor said India's economic development was 
on the "right course" and acknowledged that there was scope for 
further increasing German investments in India. 
  Mr Rao, declaring there was "absolutely no hesitation or 
dilution in the commitment to liberalisation," urged German 
industrialists to take "one more determined step" to increase 
the flow of investments, in view of the "ideal opportunity" 
provided by the reforms process in India. 
  The Prime Minister assured both Indian and German 
industrialists at the conference that he and Dr Kohl would solve 
"any problem, if it comes to our level." 
  The two leaders told the delegates that both India and 
Germany were aware of the vast and untapped potential for 
further deepening and strengthening bilateral economic relations. 
  The federal government and German industry were following 
India's policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and 
"modern India, with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at 
liberalisation, is one of our most important partners on the 
Asian continent," the German leader told Mr Rao. 
  Mr Rao said further liberalisation to cover some more items 
was on the anvil. The items to be liberalised were those which 
one could think of, he said and added that he could not say a 
syllable more because the Union budget was only three weeks away. 
  Mr Rao welcomed the Asia offensive of the German 
industrialists who are increasingly turning towards the 
Asia-Pacific region for investments. India, Japan and China have 
been identified as major thrust areas by the newly-launched 
Asia-Pacific Association (APA). 
  In his observations, the president of the Confederation of 
Indian Industry (CII), Mr Jamshed N. Godrej, announced the 
signing of a memorandum of understanding between CII and BDI 
(the German federation of industry). 
  Mr Godrej said India, Germany and Singapore could enter into 
trilateral partnership to exploit the complimentaries and 
individual advantages in areas of skilled manpower, technology 
and industrial sophistication. 
  Meanwhile, Germany has told India that it would continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and avoid making any 
value judgment in the matter. 
  The issue figured prominently during the talks Mr Rao had 
with German leaders, during which he voiced serious concern over 
the problems his country faced with regard to Pakistan's aid to 
terrorists in the Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir and 
Punjab. 
  The issue also figured during the foreign secretary-level 
talks where the Indian foreign secretary, Mr K. Srinivasan, 
briefed his German counterpart on the outcome of the recent 
foreign secretary level talks in Islamabad and the subsequent 
six proposals mooted by New Delhi." 
  Germany urged India to sign the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty (NPT), which New Delhi has refused to comply with, 
arguing that the existing global non-proliferation regimes were 
discriminatory against the developing countries. 
  The German Chancellor reiterated his strong commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation which he has been consistently and 
resolutely pursuing at all international fora. 
  The German leader told Mr Rao that strengthening the 
existing 
global non-proliferation regimes must take "absolute priority" 
and reiterated his government's resolve for an indefinite 
unconditional extension of the NPT in 1995. 
  The two countries have been engaged in a comprehensive 
dialogue on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and other 
political matters of mutual concept at the foreign office-level 
talks for quite some time. The two sides have already held three 
rounds and the fourth round is due to commence shortly. 
  Three high-level ministerial delegations from Germany will 
visit India in the first half of the current year. 
  An official spokesman today said these high-level visits, 
which will follow Mr Rao's current visit, were in line with 
Germany's "new-look" Asia concept unfolded by the Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl. 
  The spokesman said the German development co-operation 
minister would visit India next month, followed by the visit of 
the German economic co-operation minister in April. 
  The German vice-chancellor and foreign affairs minister, Mr 
Klaus Kinkel, is expected to come in May. 
  The new German perception was that it had put too many eggs 
in the European basket. It now wanted to expand its influence in 
Asia as well and had identified India, Japan and China for 
cementing ties, the spokesman said. 
  Mr Rao's visit, his second to Germany in less than three 
years, was extremely important because Germany had already 
declared India "a partner of choice in Asia." Germany had also 
described its relationship with India as a "strategic" one. 
  Germany, Europe's number one and the world's third largest 
economy, till recently used to be the second largest investor in 
India, after the United States, but had gone down to the tenth 
position after 1990. 
  However, trade volume between India and Germany had been 
growing steadily and touched nearly 5.5 billion Deutsche Mark 
(DM) in 1992. It was anticipated to cross the DM 6 billion mark 
in the current financial year. 
  Indian exports to Germany have been getting more and more 
sophisticated and diversified.
