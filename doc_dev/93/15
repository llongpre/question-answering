<LEADPARA>  Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in India on Wednesday for a six-day
visit aimed at improving relations between the world's two most populous
nations at a time when both are struggling to define their places in the
rapidly changing international order.;   Li's visit, the first by a Chinese
premier in 31 years, is being described by officials of both countries as an
important step in a continuing effort to thaw a relationship that has remained
chilly since the two countries fought a Himalayan border war in 1962. The
recent warming trend began when former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
visited Beijing three years ago.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CHINESE PREMIER BEGINS INDIA VISIT
OFFICIALS SEEK CLOSER TIES AFTER YEARS OF DISTRUST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     This week's talks are expected to produce agreements on bilateral
cooperation in space exploration and improved trade ties, including the
reopening of consulates in Bombay and Shanghai. But Indian and Chinese
officials say they do not expect any breakthroughs on the main border dispute
between the two countries, which involves unresolved claims to thousands of
square miles of largely uninhabited territory in the Himalayas.;   In
interviews published before Li's arrival, both the Chinese premier and India's
prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, emphasized that their countries shared an
interest in asserting themselves internationally at a time when an ascendant
West is moving to shape the post-Cold War order.;   In an apparent gesture to
Beijing, Indian officials arrested about 20 Tibetan democracy advocates before
Li's arrival and imposed tight security in the capital. India has for decades
provided safe haven to Tibetan exiles, including Tibet's spiritual leader, the
Dalai Llama, but had never arrested activists. A number of Tibetan protesters
demonstrated in New Delhi on Wednesday but were unable to get near the
visiting premier.  </TEXT>
