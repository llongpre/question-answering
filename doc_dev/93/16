<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "India, A Priority Area for </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 4--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today began the last leg of his Germany visit. 
Flying into Berlin from Bonn in a German Government plane, the 
Prime Minister's major programme for the day was a meeting with 
the German President, Mr. Richard von Weizsacker. Mr Rao also 
had a luncheon meeting with eminent Indologists here, when a 
number of issues to facilitate studies on India were brought to 
the notice of the Prime Minister. 
  With Mr. Weizsacker, the discussions were general in nature, 
it being basically a courtesy call. The German President is well 
acquainted with India, having been there in 1991. Mr. Weizsacker 
was in India at the height of its political crisis when the 
minority Chandra Shekar Government was in power and its 
continuance in office was under doubt. This aspect was 
highlighted by the German authorities on many occasions as a 
measure of their commitment to maintain high political relations 
with India, irrespective of the Government in power. 
  In fact, the importance that Germany attaches to India has 
been confirmed to the Prime Minister not only by the present 
Government in Bonn, but by the host of Opposition leaders as 
well, who called on Mr. Rao during his two-day stay in Bonn. 
<H5>  `Asia policy' </H5>
  The leaders of the coalition parties in the present 
Government, as well as those from other political parties, have 
also told Mr. Rao that the new "Asia policy" of Germany had a 
national consensus and would be pursued by any Government that 
comes to power after the federal elections in October this year. 
The "Asia policy" of Germany focuses on the entire Asian region 
as the priority area for trade and economic concentration as 
well as for high political contacts. Almost all the countries of 
Asia have been included in the priority list, including India 
and Pakistan, but three countries have been identified for 
intensive co-operation--China, Japan and India. 
  Parallel meetings conducted by the members of the Prime 
Ministerial delegation had also indicated that the German 
Government has sent out the signal to its industrialists that 
India is now a priority area for investment and that 
concentration should begin. The process has been facilitated by 
the fact that just a few days before Mr. Rao's visit, the 
Government of India relied to a detailed memorandum that was 
submitted by the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, after his 
return from India in February last year. This memorandum listed 
out the various irritants that were obstructing German 
investment in India and the response of the Government of India 
had been sought to the points raised. 
  The proposals submitted by the Germans were broadly divided 
into six categories covering the financial sector, the 
pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the power sector, 
telecommunications, air traffic and general issues. The Indian 
response too has been fairly detailed with areas listed out 
where decisions have already been taken. The pending areas 
include liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry, removal of phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy, 
increase in the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations, amendments to the 
Industrial Disputes Act and removal of the condition that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category. 
  The Government has also indicated that it is not in a 
position to agree to the suggestion for a negative list of 
imports, an uniform industrial policy in all the States, 
abolition of octroi and automatic adoption of environmental 
standards prescribed in advanced countries. 
<H5>  Joint Ventures </H5>
  Individual interactions between the Prime Minister and chief 
executive officesr of multinational corporations too have 
confirmed that German industry was now positive about investment 
in India. For instance, the representative of Mercedes Benz said 
that a passenger car project was being finalised with the Tata 
group which would make the project one of the major investments 
by Benz in India. Similarly, the Siemens group will be setting 
up two power projects in India--one at Jayamkondan with a 
capacity of 1,500 MW [megawatts] and another at Gandhar of 600 
MW capacity. Another multinational, BASF is setting up a 
chemicals factory in Mangalore for the manufacture of dyestuff.
