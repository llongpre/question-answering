  [Text] The prime minister left New Delhi this afternoon on 
a six-day visit to Switzerland and Germany. He was seen off at 
the airport by cabinet colleagues and senior officials. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao has been invited by the World Economic Forum to 
address the closing plenary of the symposium at Davos tomorrow. 
The prime minister is expected to apprise the world business 
community of the liberalization process in India. The theme for 
this year's Davos meet is redefining the basic assumptions of 
the world economy. The meeting of the forum, which began on 
Tuesday, is being attended by more than 20 heads of government 
and state. In all 800 company chief executives and 150 
government representatives are attending the deliberations. 
  From Davos, Mr. Rao will go on to Bonn on Wednesday on the 
second leg of his visit. He will hold talks with the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. Both the leaders will address the 
Indo-German Business Conference. The prime minister will later 
go to Berlin where he will meet the German president.
