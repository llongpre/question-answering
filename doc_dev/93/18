  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Germany has responded favourably 
to the Indian request for greater access to German technology 
and to its middle-level industry for partnership. 
  The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, during his just-concluded visit to Germany of 
clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding 
Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his 
ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic 
cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process. 
  Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their 
efforts for further democratisation of the United Nations, to 
reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of 
the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent 
members with veto. Both India and Germany are keen for a place 
in the extended Security Council with veto power. 
  In the next few months three high-level delegations from 
Germany, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for 
Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign 
Minister are slated to visit India to provide fresh impetus to 
growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields. 
  According to official sources in the External Affairs 
Ministry, in the context of German view of playing an important 
role in world affairs, Bonn has formulated a priority programme, 
"Asia concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high 
growth" Asian countries like Japan, China and India. The market 
in Russia and Europe was not considered to be sufficient to meet 
the growing German capabilities in fields like science, 
technology, economic, investment abroad. 
  These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future 
large-scale German investments could be expected in various 
spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit 
and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the 
outcome of the visit so early. 
  However, Mr Rao himself said that he was satisfied with the 
outcome of his German visit. 
  These sources further pointed out that the reception the 
Prime Minister received in Germany was much warmer and greater 
than the one he received during his first visit in September 
1991. 
  These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's 
talks 
with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated 
by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the 
talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the 
German official sources also denied having given any such 
briefing at all.
