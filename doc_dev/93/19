  [Text] Germany has assured India that it will continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on Kashmir and avoid making any value 
judgments in the matter. Kashmir figured prominently during the 
talks the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, had with the German 
leaders in Bonn. The prime minister explained to them the 
problems faced by India due to Pakistan's abetment of terrorism 
in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Mr. Narasimha Rao also 
apprised the German leaders of the serious threat posed to the 
country's unity and integrity from cross-border terrorism. The 
prime minister said Pakistan is deliberately creating conditions 
for not having a meaningful dialogue. He also informed them 
about the confidence-building measures his government had taken 
in the past toward good neighborly relations with Pakistan. 
  The issue also figured prominently during the foreign 
secretary-level talks in Bonn. The Indian side told the Germans 
about the setting up of the commission to look into the 
allegations of human rights abuses and permission given to the 
Amnesty International to visit the country. Attention was also 
drawn to the threat by Pakistan to move an anti-India resolution 
at the Geneva session on human rights. New Delhi sought 
Germany's help to thwart the attempt. Bonn assured that the 
anti-Indian motion on Kashmir will not serve any useful purpose. 
Both countries also called for wider representation in the UN 
Security Council to ensure the political effectiveness of the 
collective will of international community. Both India and 
Germany are aspirants of a permanent seat in the council.
