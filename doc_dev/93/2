  [Text] India and Germany have agreed to take all necessary 
steps to boost India-German cooperation in industrial and 
technical fields. The two countries have agreed to set up an 
India-Germany joint mechanism to monitor progress in scientific 
cooperation. An official spokesman summing up the prime 
minister's visit to Bonn said both the countries have also 
agreed to review the avoidance of double taxation treaty and 
pursue efforts to sign bilateral investment guarantees. Our 
correspondent Sudarshnam reports from Bonn: 
  [Begin Sudarshnam recording] The Federation of German 
Industry and India-German Chamber of Commerce have sent 54 
proposals to intensify the economic relationship between the two 
countries. These relate to general and financial issues, 
pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, private sector and air 
traffic. As many as 40 ministries and departments in India 
examined these proposals. Several of these have been 
implemented. Decision in respect of some are awaited. [end 
recording] 
  In another development, leading political parties of Germany 
have assured India that the New Asia concept initiated by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl making India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation will be honored whichever 
party comes to power in this year's German elections. The 
assurance was conveyed to the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, when important German political leaders called on him in 
Bonn yesterday. An official spokesman said that there is a 
multiparty support to Chancellor Kohl's New Asia concept, as 
Germany has willingly recognized that Japan, China and India in 
Asia will be important political and economic powers in the 
years to come. The chief of the German Agency for Aid has 
shown his willingness to open a second window for soft credit to 
finance infrastructure projects in India. The projects include 
power and telecommunications sector. Meanwhile, the minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who is 
accompanying the prime minister, has reiterated India's 
willingness to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. He 
made it clear that Islamabad has no locus standi in Kashmir, and 
it is not in a position to advise India in this matter. The 
minister said India has no problems regarding protection of 
human rights, and it is always ready to be open with 
international human rights organizations. 
  As reported, the prime minister is leaving for Berlin today. 
He will meet the German president and address the Humboldt 
University. Mr. Narasimha Rao is also scheduled to have meeting 
with German business leaders and inaugurate the Indian Cultural 
Center in Berlin. On Sunday [6 February], Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
returning home. Our correspondent Karuppaswamy reports that his 
meeting with German indologists and business leaders will be 
continuation of his earlier exprience in Bonn to reassure 
Germans that the reform process in India is irreversible. The 
visit of the prime minister is the first official visit from 
India to the reunited Berlin -- the upcoming capital of the 
united Germany.
