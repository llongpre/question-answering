   China and India have agreed to establish a group
to take up their thorny border dispute following discussions with
visiting Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the Foreign Ministry
announced today.
   Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, speaking at the end of Gandhi's
visit to the Chinese capital, also said good will fostered by the
trip could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the near
future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian this afternoon following three days of talks
with China's top leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared that the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute, which exploded into a short war in 1962 and
since has poisoned relations between the world's two most populous
nations, was the most pressing topic in Gandhi's talks with Premier
Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Spokesman Li, speaking at a news conference, said:
   ``Thanks to the visit, the Sino-Indian history of relations now
ushers in a new period. Leaders of the two countries conducted
sincere and in-depth discussions on the border question between
China and India, which are conducive to reaching a solution on the
boundary question in the near future.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister-level
and will be like a joint commission.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks in the past seven
years on the border, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little or no progress.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' Gandhi
said at a Wednesday news conference. ``We can't expect instant
solutions.''
   The symbolic restoration of friendly ties dominated the Gandhi
trip, although the two sides added some substance today by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for direct flights between New
Delhi and Beijing and two other accords.
   The two sides also signed a three-year cultural exchange
agreement and a science and technology accord promoting contacts
between their scientific communities.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on
Friday. The two sides are to issue a joint communique when he
departs.
