   China announced Thursday that it and India will
establish a group to tackle a border dispute that flared into a
brief war in 1962 and has poisoned relations between the world's
most populous nations ever since.
   The agreement was announced at the end of Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's historic visit to the Chinese capital. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing also said good will fostered by the
Gandhi visit could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the
near future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian on Thursday following three days of talks
with Chinese leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph, and declared the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute exploded into a short war 26 years ago and has
since kept the nations apart. It was the most pressing topic in
Gandhi's talks with Premier Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Li Zhaoxing, speaking at a news conference, said, ``thanks to the
visit the Sino-Indian history of relations now ushers in a new
period. Leaders of the two countries conducted sincere and in-depth
discussions on the border question between China and India, which
are conducive to reaching a solution on the boundary question in the
near future.''
   He said the two sides ``agreed to establish a joint working
group, which is specially devoted to the boundary question.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister level.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks since 1981 on the
border issue, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little progress.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' Gandhi
said Wednesday. ``We can't expect instant solutions.''
   Gandhi's trip to Beijing brings a new era of detente to
Sino-Indian relations that is likely to be followed next year by a
visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Gorbachev visit
will formally end 30 years of political strain and distrust between
the Soviet Union and China.
   The symbolic restoration of ties dominated the Gandhi trip,
although the two sides added some substance Thursday by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for flights between New Delhi and
Beijing and accords for cultural and technological exchanges.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on
Friday.
