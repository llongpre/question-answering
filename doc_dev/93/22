  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [2 January] India's 
head of government, P.V. Narisimha Rao, arrived in Bonn for a 
four-day visit to Germany and for talks on expanding relations. 
Rao is returning a visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited 
India last February and thus introduced a new stage of Germany's 
policy toward Asia. 
  A few hours after his arrival Rao, who will meet with Kohl, 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany), as well as high-ranking representatives of German 
industry and the leaders of the coalition parties this Thursday, 
had an appointment with Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter 
Spranger (Christian Social Union). The minister will go to 
India on 10 February to take a look at the projects of 
German-Indian cooperation in situ. On Wednesday, the Fraunhofer 
Society for the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council 
of Scientific and Industrial Research" signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  Deepening political and economic cooperation between India, 
which has 900 million inhabitants, and Germany will be the focus 
of all of Rao's meetings in Bonn and Berlin. On Friday 
President Richard von Weizsaecker will receive Rao in Bellevue 
Palace in Berlin. [passage omitted]
