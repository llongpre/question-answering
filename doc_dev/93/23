Demanding an end to China's rule of Tibet, Tibetan refugees in New Delhi,

<LEADPARA>  Chinese Premier Li Peng offered on Friday in New Delhi, India, to open a
dialogue with the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet, on any subject
except Tibetan independence. Li, whose visit to India has been dogged by
protests from Tibetan refugees, reiterated Beijing's position that Tibet is a
province of China, and there is no room to discuss independence, news services
reported. Tibetan officials were not immediately available for comment. But
the Chinese condition on talks with the Dalai Lama has prevented such meetings
in the past. Before Li's arrival Wednesday for a six-day visit, a spokesman
for the Dalai Lama's government in exile said the Chinese were approached with
a proposal for a meeting between Li and the Dalai Lama. But they replied that
the Dalai Lama must first renounce the demand for Tibetan independence. The
56-year-old Buddhist monk left New Delhi for his home in Dharmsala, 250 miles
north, the day before Li arrived. It was the first time since the Dalai Lama
fled Tibet in 1959 that he was in the same country at the same time as China's
leader.  </LEADPARA>
