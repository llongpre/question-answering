   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi put aside the
affairs of state for some sightseeing Tuesday, a day after talks
with Chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have
divided the world's two most populous nations.
   No breakthroughs were reported on the border issue, which led to
war in 1962.
   Gandhi also discussed Tibet, trade and the Cambodian conflict in
the Monday talks which his official spokesman described as ``warm,
cordial and very friendly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng and Gandhi met most of Monday following
Gandhi's arrival from New Delhi for a five-day visit to Beijing,
Xian and Shanghai. Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, were later treated to
a state banquet at which Li acted as host.
   Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the last Indian
leader to travel to China, going to Beijing in 1954. Chinese and
Indian leaders last met in 1960, when then-Premier Chou En-lai went
to New Delhi.
   On Tuesday, Gandhi toured the Temple of Heaven, a 15th century
structure where China's emperors once prayed for good harvests and
performed sacrificial rituals.
   In the afternoon, he was to travel 40 miles northwest of Beijing,
the capital, to the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The
3,720-mile-long barrier was built over 2,000 years to keep out
invaders from the north.
   Gandhi's only scheduled meeting Tuesday was with 81-year-old
President Yang Shangkun, a former senior army leader who took over
the largely ceremonial state post last April.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is to meet 84-year-old senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   China and India are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices
in Shanghai and Bombay may also be established.
   In comments throughout Monday, Gandhi and Li said Chinese-Indian
relations should follow a two-track policy of solving the border
dispute and improving other areas of their relationship.
   ``It is now time to look beyond the past,'' Gandhi said at the
banquet. ``It is now time to look forward to the future. It is now
time to restore the relationship between our two countries.''
   The pronouncements appeared to signal a change in Indian policy,
bringing it more in line with that of the Chinese. India said in the
past it would improve Indian-Chinese ties only after progress was
made on the border.
   Western diplomats said last week that Gandhi's political worries
and India's external problems could have sparked the change.
   China is improving its relations with the Soviet Union and
maintains strong relations with Pakistan, India's traditional enemy
on its northeastern border.
   China's strong international position may have convinced New
Delhi to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to Beijing, the
diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At home, Gandhi faces an election year next year in which victory
is by no means assured.
   Li also praised India's position on the restive region of Tibet,
which India recognizes as part of China.
   The Indian spokesman also said Gandhi and Li discussed Cambodia,
but he refused to elaborate. India recognizes the current government
of Cambodia, which was installed by Vietnam after the Hanoi
government invaded the country in December 1978. China supports
Cambodian resistance groups.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after Beijing's 1949 revolution. In the early
1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political
disagreements. The border remains heavily guarded despite eight
rounds of Indian-Chinese talks on the question since 1981, the last
of which took place in November 1987.
   India says China should return 15,200 square miles of territory
it took in the 1962 war.
