<LEADPARA>  With the dominant Congress Party set to form a new government, a major power
struggle erupted Tuesday over the prime minister's job that pits the frail
party president against a younger, influential regional leader from the
business capital, Bombay.;    Meeting through the day and evening in closed
sessions at party headquarters and at various hotels, party officials were
faced Tuesday night with a potentially bruising clash between P.V. Narasimha
Rao, the 70-year-old former Cabinet minister who stepped into the party's
presidency after the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and Sharad
Pawar, the tough, pragmatic, 51-year-old chief minister of India's key
industrial state, Maharashtra. Although Rao is favored, Pawar is staging a
dogged fight.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At issue between the two men are less their ideologies, which are centrist,
than their personalities and styles, which are strikingly different.;   
Pawar, who has said in the past that he abhors "the social and political
culture in Delhi," the capital, is a highly successful regional politician
with a reputation for toughness and an ability to raise millions of dollars
for the party in the state and nation among businessmen in Bombay.;    Rao, on
the other hand, is an ailing, soft-spoken leader who has no political base and
few enemies, an intellectual whose critics say he would be too pliant to the
various factions in the party, thereby leaving the nation adrift for six
months to a year until new elections are called. Among those favoring Rao are
the so-called coterie of aides to Rajiv Gandhi, a group that Pawar is known to
detest.;    By Tuesday evening, at least 40 members of Parliament who are
believed to be supporters of Pawar demanded, in a statement, that lawmakers be
"left free" to elect their leader and that the party "opt for the democratic
process of election.";    Implicit in the somewhat unusual statement was
concern by Pawar's supporters that the Congress Party bosses as well as the
former aides to Gandhi were seeking to steamroll the appointment of Rao, a
former foreign minister who served under Gandhi as well as his mother, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    The debate comes as the party, which has ruled
India for 40 out of 44 years, prepared to return to power after emerging as
the front-runner in the nation's 10th parliamentary election. Projected to win
about 210 to 215 seats in Parliament, out of 511, Congress is now in the midst
of talks with left-of-center parties to forge a coalition that would enable it
to form a government.;    With Parliament set to resume on Thursday, the
Congress Party leadership is working under a deadline in which it will either
choose the leader and present the choice as a fait accompli to lawmakers, or
leave it up to the rank-and-file members of the party, who are seeking a
stronger voice in the control of India's dominant party after Rajiv Gandhi's
death.  </TEXT>
