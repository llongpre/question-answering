  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 6--On the completion of the 
week-long foreign visit to Switzerland and Germany, the Prime 
Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned home today, highly 
satisfied with the interactions with political and business 
leaders. 
  Declining to address the customary on-board conference on 
his 
special aircraft, Mr. Rao just told presspersons in his 
delegation that "you have seen how the visit went off. I don't 
think I have anything more to add." 
  The task of elaborating on the Prime Minister's successful 
trip was left to the top officials who accompanied him, 
including his Principal Secretary, Mr. A.N. Verma, the Finance 
Secretary, Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the Foreign Secretary, 
Mr. K. Srinivasan. These officials drew attention to some of the 
significant aspects of the Prime Ministerial visit both in terms 
of economic and political content. 
  On the economic front, there were two factors which emerged 
from the visit. In Davos for instance, Mr. Rao chose the 
gathering of world business leaders to clarify India's position 
that it would go along on the path of economic reforms, but 
would choose its own pace and direction. 
<H5>  Pressure Resisted </H5>
  The insistent pressure on India to speed up the reforms 
process has been resisted by the assertion that the country 
would not blindly follow the prescriptions laid down by "people 
sitting thousands of miles away, but would instead choose its 
own model of development, suited to its genius and 
circumstances." In other words, potential foreign investors have 
been assured of the Government's commitment to the reforms 
process but with the caution that all their demands would not be 
met. 
  "There is a standard check-list with these people before 
they 
take investment decisions. Has the country de-regulated; has it 
lowered tariff barriers; has it privatised (meaning the public 
sector); has it liberalised labour laws, etc. We have said "Yes" 
to some of these points and "No" to the others. That is our 
position and it has been made clear to the investors what to 
expect from India," a senior official said. 
  That the Indian official position this year could be 
different from what it was in 1992--the Prime Minister's first 
visit to Davos--is obviously based on the stronger economic 
position today. With foreign exchange reserves of over $10 
billions, with a large number of proposals for foreign direct 
investment being cleared and with buoyant foreign institutional 
investment in the stock markets, India could afford to take a 
stronger stand at Davos this time, the official added. This 
strong economic position is reinforced by the fact that India is 
now definitely on the "investment radar screen" of most 
industrial groups, particularly with the collapse of the 
expectations that had arisen with the changes in eastern Europe 
two years ago. 
  "The euphoria about Russia is over. The other markets don't 
show much prospects. The Asian region and India are the few 
bright spots for investors and most of them are aware that they 
should be in India in the medium term. This is the message we 
got in Davos," the official added. 
<H5>  Industry, Government Mix </H5>
  The second important development of the Prime Ministerial 
visit is the new relationship established between Government and 
industry. This was evident not only in Davos but also in Germany 
where the inter-mixing of the official and industrial delegation 
was so much that the entire entourage of industrial leaders 
practically became part of the Prime Minister's delegation. 
  The meeting between Indian and German industrialists in Bonn 
was held in the office of the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut 
Kohl. "This is unprecedented. Never has the NATO [North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation] room of the Chancellor's office been thrown 
open for an industrial meet," the Indian Ambassador in Bonn, Mr. 
K.S. Rana, pointed out. The second point to note was that at 
this meeting, where Mr. Rao and Mr. Kohl were present, the top 
bureaucrats of the Government of India literally took a back 
seat and were seated behind the Indian industrial delegation. 
"This too has never happened before. Imagine the Finance 
Secretary sitting behind an industrialist," one official pointed 
out. 
  "The industrialists were given the signal that they were as 
much important in selling India as an investment destination as 
the Government. This close relationship between Government and 
industry is a new development, unlike in the past when 
officialdom maintained a distance from industry," the official 
said. 
<H5>  Politically Significant </H5>
  On the political front too, Mr. Rao's second visit to 
Germany 
in a little over two years is of much significance. As is known, 
this is an election year in Germany, including that for the 
Federal Chancellery and going by indications available now, Mr. 
Kohl faces an extremely difficult task in getting re-elected. 
His bane has been the economy, which has come under severe 
pressure with the unification of West and East Germany, an 
achievement for which Mr. Kohl had taken the entire credit in 
the past. 
  Today, there is over 10 per cent unemployment in the 
country, 
the economy is expected to grow at zero per cent and interest 
rates are too high for fresh investment. In short, the economy 
is in recession and is burdened by the continuing cost of 
reconstruction of the eastern parts. 
  Mr. Rao's singular political achievement with this visit has 
been the establishment of a rapport with the entire political 
spectrum in Germany. The packed schedule that the Prime Minister 
had in Bonn was marked for the more meetings he had with 
Opposition political leaders against the one meeting with Mr. 
Kohl. Moreover, the message that Mr. Rao got from these meetings 
was that India would continue to be a priority area for Germany, 
irrespective of the Government that comes to office after the 
October elections. 
  "The Asia Policy of Mr. Kohl has national support and this 
has been confirmed by the political leaders who met the Prime 
Minister. Thus, India would remain a partner of choice and the 
strategic partnership between the two countries would remain 
unaltered even with political changes in Germany. This assurance 
has been received by India," another top official in the Prime 
Ministerial entourage said.
