<F P=106> [Report signed "sm": "Installation Constructers Hope for </F>
Large-Scale Orders"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 31 January -- Economic relations will be 
the focal issue of a four-day visit to Germany by Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao to begin on Wednesday [2 February]. 
German companies hope this visit will support their efforts to 
get large-scale orders from India. In return, Rao is working 
for German investment on the subcontinent. 
  One of the central issues of the talks in Bonn is the 
participation of German companies in expanding the power supply 
in India. This involves orders worth double-digit billion sums. 
Yesterday, Indian Energy Minister Salve explained to leading 
German installation constructors in Bonn his government's plans 
for expanding the energy supply. According to him, new 
construction is planned of seven conventional power stations 
with a capacity of 5,500 megawatts and an investment of 12 
billion German marks. In addition, seven existing power 
stations are to be modernized, that is, to be equipped with 
modern environmental technology. Furthermore, it is planned to 
expand India's mains distribution. [passage omitted] 
  During his visit to Bonn, Rao will take time for a 
"German-Indian economic conference," and for individual talks 
with the directors of Hoechst, BASF, Mercedes, and Siemens as 
well as with Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech. 
  The political talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping will focus primarily on coordinating a joint 
route toward the goal of the two countries getting permanent 
seats on the UN Security Council. The Germans will also be 
urging India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
