  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- After warnings from 
Bonn because of the conflict between China and Tibet, the Dalai 
Lama, the Tibetan leader, has declined an invitation to the 
1,200th anniversary of Frankfurt/Main. The Foreign Ministry had 
warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the Dalai 
Lama and the mayor of Frankfurt's Chinese partner city of 
Guangzhou could lead to "problems." On Wednesday [16 February] 
the Dalai Lama's Swiss representative office declined the 
invitation that Frankfurt Mayor Andreas von Schoeler (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) had extended to the Dalai Lama, who 
lives in exile in India. 
  The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling for the 
reestablishment of the autonomous status of Tibet, which is 
under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office 
in Zurich says the Dalai Lama had been very sorry to hear that 
his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had 
been created without his fault "as a result of obviously 
political motives." He wants to spare the city and its 
population difficulties. He had been pleased with the 
invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]
