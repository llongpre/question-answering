  [Excerpts] Germany has assured India that it will continue 
to take a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and not make any 
value judgments. Kashmir figured prominently in the talks 
between the prime minister and the German leaders in Bonn. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao explained to them the problems faced by India 
because of Pakistan's abetment of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir 
and Punjab. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Spranger, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. He emphasized that the theme of the Asian 
partnership choice and strategic partnership should be made a 
reality [sentence as heard]. 
  Our correspondent S. Sudarshanam adds from Bonn that India's 
line of thinking is in tune with Germany's new Asia policy which 
seeks to widen its cooperation with the Asian countries like 
Japan, China, and India. The German minister told the prime 
minister that he would lead a 20-member delegation to India soon 
to explore further cooperation in trade, investment, and joint 
venture in technical and technological fields. The signing of 
aid protocol for this year will also come up during his visit. 
  Meanwhile, the new foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, 
told 
newspersons at Bonn that the German leaders emphasized greater 
cooperation in trade, science, and technology. He said Germany 
is a major trading partner with India and two German ministers 
in charge of economic development and foreign affairs are 
planning to visit India before June this year. 
  The chairman of the German multinational corporation, Bayer, 
held talks with the prime minister and indicated that Bayer is 
to set up a pharmaceutical plant at Manali in Tamil Nadu. This 
afternoon, the prime minister will have talks with the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, on strengthening economic and trade 
relations. Dr. Kohl will host a working lunch. Cooperation in 
scientific, technical, and cultural fields and issues of mutual 
interests are likely to figure in the talks. The prime 
minister, now on a four-day official visit, will leave for 
Berlin tomorrow.
