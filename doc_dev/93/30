  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
left New Delhi this morning for the United States. He was seen 
off at the airport by his cabinet colleagues, chief ministers of 
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, the governor of 
Uttar Pradesh and senior officials. The seven-day visit will 
take Mr. Narasimha Rao to four cities, including the capital 
Washington and will enable him to meet a broad segment of the 
Clinton Administration, congressmen, and business circles. 
  Our correspondent, M. Rama Rao, covering the visit, says the 
main thrust of the prime minister's talks will be on enhanced 
economic and investment cooperation between the two countries. 
India will also reiterate its position on sensitive issues like 
Nuclear Nonproliferation, arms control, human rights, and 
Kashmir to the U.S. leaders. The Clinton-Rao talks slated for 
Thursday are expected to be open and frank, giving the leaders 
an opportunity to appreciate each other's point of view on world 
issues as also matters of mutual concern. 
  A high-level official delegation is accompanying the prime 
minister. It includes the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; 
the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salaman 
Khurshid; and the minister of state in the prime minister's 
office, Mr. Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi. A 21-member trade delegation 
drawn from the three apex bodies of Indian industry is also 
accompanying the prime minister to help forge enhanced Indo-U.S. 
economic relations. The highlights of the visit include an 
address by Mr. Narasimha Rao to a joint meeting of the U.S. 
Congress and the lecture at the prestigious Harvard University.
