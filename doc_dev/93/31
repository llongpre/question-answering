  [Text] New Delhi, June 3 KYODO -- The Chinese Government 
will soon allow the young spiritual head of the Kagyu sect of 
Tibetan Buddhism to make his first visit to his seat in Rumtek 
monastery in northeast India, sources belonging to the sect said 
Thursday [2 June]. 
  The 11-year-old Ugyen Thinley Dorjee, whose identity as the 
reincarnation of the sect's 16th karmapa was revealed in 1992, 
currently lives in the sect's former headquarters in Tsurphu 
monastery, some 50 kilometers from the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. 
  "The Chinese Government has agreed to allow the new karmapa 
to go to India for a brief visit," the sources said. The timing 
and duration of the visit is still unknown, they said. 
  A high-level team of lamas, including Tai Situ Rimponche who 
was largely responsible for the discovery of the sect's 17th 
living god, returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi after 
successful negotiations with the Chinese Government in the last 
week of May, the sources said. 
  The reincarnation of the 16th karmapa was found with Chinese 
help through a prediction letter which Tai Situ Rimpoche, a 
regent of the last karmapa, discovered in 1989 almost a decade 
after the last karmapa's death. 
  All 15 karmapas since 1193 were identified in their 
childhood 
on the basis of prediction letters left by their predecessors. 
  However, a rival group of lamas questioning the authenticity 
of the letter this March enthroned a 10-year-old Tibetan boy, 
Tenzin Chentse, in a Buddhist monastery in New Delhi claiming he 
is the last karmapa's true reincarnation. 
  According to a Tibetan follower of the sect, it is the first 
time that two karmapas have been enthroned, although numerous 
succession struggles have occurred throughout the sect's 
900-year history. 
  Both vie for control over Rumtek monastery, which became the 
sect's center after the last Karmapa fled Tibet during the 1959 
uprising. The karmapa is considered No. 3 in Tibet's 
religio-political hierarchy after the dalai lama and the panchen 
lama. 
  By retaining the new karmapa in Tibet, Beijing is trying to 
calm the restive Tibetan populace there, one expert on Tibet 
said. 
  Beijing needs a religious figure compliant to its policies, 
with the panchen lama dead in early 1989 and no successor in 
sight, and the dalai lama remaining in his self-imposed Indian 
exile, he said.
