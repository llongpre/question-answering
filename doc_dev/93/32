  [Text] India is in the agonising process of an evaluation 
whether the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, should 
call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States, 
sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is 
sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly 
advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the 
vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would 
help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove 
growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. 
  If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks 
by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is 
evident that they do not see India requiring any high-level 
attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two 
decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy 
Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in 
the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any 
visits in the near future either. 
  The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to 
India. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between 
India and the United States. But all the loving and hating is 
done by India only. 
  Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent 
spate of provocative statements from the White House and the 
State Department makes it all the more imperative for Mr 
Narasimha Rao to meet the top U.S. leadership and other opinion 
makers in the country. They point out that such 
misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest 
political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake 
if he did not do so because of false prestige. 
  If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of 
President Clinton were responsible for pushing this 
administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis India, a 
personal encounter between him and Mr Rao may well restore the 
balance. Moreover, Prime Minister Rao would also have the 
opportunity in Washington to meet influential Congressmen, 
Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain New 
Delhi's case on Kashmir, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
(NPT) and a host of other contentious issues. 
  Those who support Mr Narasimha Rao's going to Washington are 
convinced that he would get strong backing from the business 
lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of 
the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is 
perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this 
should enable him [to] project a progressive image of India in 
the United States as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about 
human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab as well as on 
nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent. 
  Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in 
Beijing which has managed to deflect criticism on the human 
rights front by luring big American business with tempting 
investment prospects in China. A similar gambit by Narasimha 
Rao, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with U.S. 
businessmen pressurising the Clinton Administration to stop 
making provocative statements and gestures against this country. 
  The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by Mr 
Narasimha Rao is that if he refused to go to Washington out of 
pique with the Clinton administration, it would only allow 
Pakistan--its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, is also 
scheduled to visit the United States within a few months--a free 
propaganda run. It is felt that Ms Bhutto would then use this to 
project New Delhi as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like 
Kashmir and NPT. 
  Those who are against the Prime Minister going to 
Washington, 
however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that 
in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when 
there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between 
Washington and New Delhi, a Prime Ministerial visit could be 
counterproductive with only the differences between two 
countries getting articulated. 
  Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on 
bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative 
pronouncements on India from the Clinton Administration, 
including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere 
visit to Washington by Mr Narasimha Rao. In fact, there is a 
possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working 
out a compromise at the moment. 
  There is also the question of personal vibes between Mr 
Narasimha Rao and the U.S. President. Both leaders come from 
different generations and cultures with clashing styles and 
world views. 
  While it is possible that a leader like Rajiv Gandhi may 
have 
hit it off with President Clinton, this appears to be far more 
unlikely in the case of Prime Minister Rao. Even if there are no 
open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal 
encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory, 
resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao's mild professorial style, however 
impressive to the knowledgeable on India affairs, is also 
unlikely to attract much media attention in the United States. 
This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with Ms Bhutto's visit 
which is bound to cause more flutter in the U.S. media. 
  In any case, the flamboyant young Harvard educated leader 
has 
many more personal friends in the U.S. establishment, 
particularly in the Clinton Administration. Under the 
circumstances, Mr Narasimha Rao, if he goes to Washington, would 
be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani 
counterpart. 
  Significantly, most officials both in the Foreign Office and 
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic 
about Mr Narasimha Rao visiting Washington at this point. While 
the Foreign Office is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful 
Prime Ministerial visit to the United States further 
complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between 
New Delhi, Washington and Islamabad, the PMO is apprehensive 
about the political repurcussions at home in the event of Mr 
Narasimha Rao failing to pull off a public relations coup with 
President Clinton. 
  There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country 
today, 
including the national media, which closely follows the progress 
of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the 
success or failure of Mr Rao's visit in all probability would be 
exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead 
or not with his trip to the United States may have far less 
impact on bilateral ties than other factors. Mr Rao would have 
to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix 
dates for the proposed visit. 
  This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who 
has been pressing for a visit to Washington for the past many 
months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to 
Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to Mr 
Rao's cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in 
Beijing and Tehran and Davos. 
  A failure or even a damp squib in Washington, on the other 
hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime 
Minister Rao but also further add to the mounting strident 
anti-U.S. chorus in this country.
