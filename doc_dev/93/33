<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "Germany Will Stay Neutral on </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 3--India has conveyed to the German 
Government the latest position in the bilateral talks with 
Pakistan at the Foreign Secretary level, held in Islamabad this 
January and the follow-up in terms of exchange of "Non-papers." 
  At Germany's request, India has given a summary of the 
discussions that took place. Also handed over are copies of two 
non-papers presented by Pakistan, including the one on 
plebiscite in Kashmir, which were subsequently rejected by 
India, and the six Indian proposals pertaining to 
confidence-building measures aimed at improving bilateral 
relations. 
  These documents were handed over during the Foreign 
Secretary-level discussions here on Wednesday. The Indian side 
was led by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, who 
flew into Bonn to be part of the Prime Ministerial delegation. 
Wednesday's discussions were the fourth in a series of talks 
structured by India and Germany for closer political contacts. 
The earlier three rounds were conducted by the then Foreign 
Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and his predecessor, Mr. Muchkund 
Dubey. 
  Though maintaining a neutral stance on Kashmir and 
Indo-Pakistan relations in general, Germany is interested in 
seeing an early resolution of the problem and improvement in 
ties between Delhi and Islamabad. The same dilemma confronts 
Germany over Pakistan's strident propaganda against India on the 
question of alleged human rights abuses. 
  The talks here took notice of the shrill speech by the 
Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, at the Human Rights 
Conference in Geneva on Tuesday, when India conveyed its 
displeasure at the Pakistani move to try and get a resolution 
passed against it. The Indian side has conveyed to Germany what 
New Delhi's attitude would be if the resolution is indeed moved 
and the consequences. 
  In response, Germany, typically, remained non-committal, 
saying it was neutral on the issue and added that moving such a 
resolution would not help in improving Indo-Pakistan bilateral 
relations. 
  The other matter that came up for discussion pertained to 
the 
restructuring of the United Nations. Germany already filed 
papers for election as a non-permanent member in the Security 
Council and solicited Indian support. India kept its options 
open, saying many others had filed papers and a final decision 
on supporting a particular country would be taken later. The 
decision would, of course, depend on the status of India's 
bilateral relations with the contending countries, it was said. 
  Strategic alliance: According to observers, the 
significance of the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's visit to 
this country twice within a short span of two years is part of a 
strategic alliance India and Germany want to form. While trade 
and economic exchanges are in the forefront of such an alliance, 
the political aspect is equally significant. 
  India, on the other hand, is keen on taking advantage of 
Germany's new Asia policy under which it wants to focus on the 
continent with emphasis on China, Japan and India. India, 
therefore, wants closer political contacts with an emerging 
global power as well as one of the key nations of Europe. 
  The idea is to have greater interaction so that Germany will 
have a better perception of the Indian position on various 
thorny issues, including Kashmir and human rights, which are 
being internationalised. The fact that Mr. Kohl in particular 
and Germany in general enjoy a good rapport with the United 
States administration under Mr. Bill Clinton is also taken note 
of. 
  To keep up political contacts, with Germany a series of 
bilateral visits has been planned for the current year, though 
this is year of elections, also involving the offices of 
President and Chancellor, are to be held in Germany. 
  Talks at the level of officials are also on for finalising 
treaties on double taxation avoidance and extradition and a 
bilateral agreement for investment guarantee.
