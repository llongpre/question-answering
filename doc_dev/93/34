  [Text] The Chinese ambassador, Mr Cheng Ruisheng's 
statement, that Beijing is soon likely to officially recognise 
Sikkim's merger with India, is further good tidings for New 
Delhi and indicates that India can now look forward to the 
dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from 
past hostility between the two countries. Ever since Indira 
Gandhi's decision to make the "Protectorate" of Sikkim a State 
of the Republic in 1975, Beijing has steadfastly questioned the 
legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the 
Himalayan kingdom's merger with India and whether or not a 
sovereign nation had been subjugated, Beijing was bothered by 
the disappearance of a buffer between India and China. After 
all, Sikkim had been the gateway to Tibet and its merger with 
India meant pushing the Indian frontier that much forward. 
Indeed, Chinese unhappiness with the turn of the events was 
reflected in Beijing's refusal to acknowledge Sikkim as a part 
of the Indian Union, a view which has been repeatedly expressed 
over the years. 
  It was Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China that led to a softening 
in Beijing's stand on Sikkim insofar as any official mention of 
the protectorate's merger with India was concerned. It is 
possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy 
with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures 
on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal 
of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting 
Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China 
last year which led to the Sino- Indian agreement on maintaining 
peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, 
second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent 
the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have 
contributed towards an upswing in Sino-Indian relations to the 
detriment of America's hegemonistic designs in the region, an 
added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan-China axis. 
  True, Beijing's official recognition of Sikkim's merger will 
not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino-Indian 
relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth 
road to solving the vexatious border dispute. At the same time, 
the benefits of narrowing down differences in other areas by 
stepping around what is apparently an intractable problem cannot 
be over- emphasised. Some problems will continue to plague 
Sino-Indian relations and both New Delhi and Beijing will have 
to learn to cope with them if a lasting relation is to be forged 
between the two Asian giants. For instance, Beijing will have 
to stop doubting New Delhi's official position on Tibet -- that 
it is an autonomous zone of China -- and accept the 
inevitability of pluralism in a democratic society. By 
cavilling at views on Tibet's future expressed by individuals at 
seminars and rallies, like it did recently, Beijing will be 
running the risk of setting the clock back. A better option 
would be to hasten the reopening of the silk route which once 
connected two civilisations.
