   Thousands of Tibetans threw flowers and
offered silk scarves in a tumultous welcome Tuesday for their
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who returned to his home-in-exile
with the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama arrived at New Delhi's international airport just
past midnight and was greeted by cheering men, women and children
from the 100,000-member Tibetan community exiled in India.
   Inside the airport's arrival lounge, monks in maroon and saffron
robes lined up to welcome the 54-year-old Dalai Lama with low bows
and traditional gifts of white scarves. Outside, thousands of
Tibetans lighted incense sticks and covered the roadway with
marigold and rose petals.
   ``I feel (the award) is recognition of my sincerest motivation
for nonviolent action,'' the leader of Tibet's resistance to
Chinese rule told reporters. ``I feel it may help to create more
awareness for the value of compassion and nonviolence.''
   When he was awarded the prize in Oslo, Norway, on Oct. 5, the
Dalai Lama was in California on one of the U.S. visits he makes at
least twice a year to minister to Buddhist faithful and to heighten
international awareness of the Tibetan struggle. He spent four
weeks in the United States on this trip.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the 1951 Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
He has set up a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, an Indian town
300 miles north of New Delhi.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that China retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   So far, there has been no concession by China. The Beijing
government has said it is willing to discuss Tibet. However, it
insists Tibet must remain an integral part of China.
   Asked whether his receiving the 1989 Nobel Prize could alter
Beijing's stance, the Dalai Lama said: ``At the moment, I don't
know. But after a few months you may see something.'' He did not
elaborate.
   China has condemned the award as an insult and interference in
its internal affairs.
   The Dalai Lama, dressed in the sleeveless robes of an ordinary
Buddhist monk and wearing a rosary on his left wrist, said he had
still not decided what to do with the award's $469,000 cash prize.
   ``I may contribute something for the starving people in Africa
or create an institution for world peace,'' he said. ``I need some
more ideas. I will speak to my colleagues.''
