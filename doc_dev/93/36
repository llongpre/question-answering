  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (AFP)--China strongly criticized 
India Tuesday [22 March] for failing to prevent a recent 
conference on Tibet from being held in New Delhi, slamming the 
event as a "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "We 
deeply deplore that such anti-China political activities had not 
been forestalled on the territory of India," said a foreign 
ministry spokesman, referring to last week's All-Party Indian 
Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. 
  The three-day convention, attended by parliamentarians from 
30 countries, "openly trumpeted for `liberation of Tibet' on the 
grounds that there were human rights problems in Tibet," the 
spokesman said. "This anti-China act and gross interference in 
China' internal affairs has aroused great indignation of the 
whole Chinese people including the Tibetan compatriots," he said. 
  The conference statement denounced alleged Chinese human 
rights abuses in Tibet, urged the release of all Tibetan 
political prisoners and expressed concern over Chinese nuclear 
testing in the region -- which Chinese troops entered in 1951. 
It also called on China to open unconditional talks with the 
Dalai Lama and urged the United Nations to grant observer status 
to the Tibetan spiritual leader's government-in-exile, based in 
northern India but not recognised by any country. 
  "We thoroughly condemn the anti-China clamours made at the 
meeting," which was organised by "a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international 
anti-Chinese force," said the foreign ministry spokesman. 
  The Indian government has also come under fire from 
conference delegates, who accuse it of succumbing to Chinese 
pressure by trying to scuttle the event by denying a venue in 
the heart of New Delhi and by allegedly declining visas to some 
MPs. "The (Indian) government put obstacles at the behest of 
China. China twisted India's arm," said Indian MP George 
Fernandes Sunday, calling on the Indian government to support 
the Tibetan cause. Fernandes said the Dalai Lama, who has 
lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed 
anti-Chinese revolt, did not make an appearance at the 
convention because of Indian pressures. 
  India, which is home to some 100,000 Tibetan exiles, treats 
Tibet as an autonomous region of China and has cracked down 
hard on Tibetan protestors during visits by Chinese leaders in 
recent years.
