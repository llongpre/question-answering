  [Text] The Czech president, Dr. Vaclav Havel, has been 
presented with the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament, 
and Development for the year 1993. Presenting the prestigious 
award at the Ashoka Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House] 
in New Delhi today, the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, 
described Mr. Havel as a champion of human rights. He said Dr. 
Havel has done a (?signal) service in providing politics its 
moral dimension. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, said India has an exemplary record on human rights. He 
said the aspersion on India's record on this issue is caused by 
those who themselves do not have any respect for human dignity. 
Mr. Rao described the president of the new republic as the 
father of democratic movement in Europe. The award carries 25 
lakh rupees and a plaque. 
  The Czech president described the award as the best tribute 
to the people of his country, who waged a relentless struggle 
against the totalitarian regime through nonviolence. The vice 
president, Mr. Dr. K.R. Narayanan, and the chairperson of the 
Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, also spoke on 
the occasion. 
  Later, addressing a press conference, Dr. Vaclav Havel said 
there is great potential for economic cooperation between India 
and his country. He observed that both countries are pursuing 
economic reforms and there is a need for exchanging information 
about the opportunities available in each country. In this 
regard, Mr. Havel sought to have an investment protection 
agreement with India and hoped that the draft agreement 
submitted by his delegation in this regard will be formalized by 
the middle of this year. Expressing his satisfaction at the 
discussions with the Indian leaders and businessmen, he said two 
agreements on trade and avoidance of double taxation have been 
signed. 
  Replying to a question on supplying spare parts to Indian 
defense equipment, Mr. Havel said there is no reason why his 
country should not export defense equipment to peace-loving 
democratic countries. He, however, firmly said that the Czech 
Republic will not export defense equipment to some countries 
which were receiving armaments from the former Czechoslovakia. 
The deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Ivan 
Kocarnik, said companies from his country will now onwards 
participate in tenders for projects in India. A delegation of 
Indian businessmen will visit Prague soon to establish relations 
with the Czech businessmen. 
  Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the 
visiting Czech president, Dr. Havel, discussed the possibilities 
of cooperation in several areas between the two countries at 
their meeting in New Delhi today. Mr. Rao said India was 
particularly interested in the cooperation in infrastructure 
development. The two leaders deliberated on the role and 
relevance of the United Nations. Mr. Rao said India was 
committed to the UN and its democratization. He also accepted 
the Czech president's invitation to visit the Czech Republic.
