  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
underlined the importance of economic relations between Germany 
and India. Kohl said today at the start of a German-Indian 
economic conference at the Bonn Chancellery, in the presence of 
Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narisimha Rao, that this conference 
underlined the "special importance" that the German Government 
attached to relations between the two countries. 
  Rao arrived in Germany for a two-day visit to Bonn on 2 
February. Kohl welcomed the prime minister with military honors 
this morning at the Chancellery. Afterward they met for talks. 
Rao is also to visit Berlin on the 4th and 5th February. 
  At the economic conference, the chancellor said that 
relations between Germany and India in the science and 
technology areas had always been very close and are 
characterized by cooperation in a spirit of trust on many 
projects. Kohl announced that it was agreed today to set up a 
high-level German-Indian Commission for Science and Technology. 
Mutual economic relations had developed "gratifyingly" in the 
past few years. Today, Germany was India's second most 
important supplier and fourth most important market. German 
investments in India were "considerable, but could still 
increase." 
  Rao welcomed German industry's Asian offensive. This project 
was appropriate to the positive economic developments in Asia, 
he said. 
  The economic conference, the climax of Rao's visit, was 
opened by Siemens head Heinrich von Pierer, the chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Association of German industry. A large number of 
Indian and German business representatives took part in the 
conference. [passage omitted]
