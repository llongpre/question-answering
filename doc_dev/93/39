<LEADPARA>  The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, said Saturday that China had
rebuffed his offer to meet with Prime Minister Li Peng next week when both
will be in New Delhi, India.;   "We asked the Chinese government, through the
Chinese Embassy in India, for one of my officials to meet him. . . . My idea
was, if that meeting goes well, then I myself would like to meet with the
Chinese prime minister," the Dalai Lama said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The answer, which we already have, was no," he said.;   He said China
rebuffed the offer because "Tibetans are still fighting for their
independence.";   An aide said the Dalai Lama last met a Chinese prime
minister in 1954.;   The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India in 1959 after a
failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupation. He has not returned
since.;   The Buddhist monk, considered the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai
Lama by his followers, said he wants to visit his homeland, but only if China
allows him to move freely.;   Tenzin Geyche Tethong, his personal secretary,
said the Dalai Lama hopes pro-democracy reforms in Eastern Europe and other
parts of the world will spread to China.  </TEXT>
