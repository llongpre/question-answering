   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came home
Friday after five days in China and said his visit restored the
friendly Indian-Chinese relations of the early 1950s.
   Also Friday, about 100 Tibetan students outside Parliament set
fire to a Chinese flag and denounced India's recognition of Tibet as
part of China. Police with bamboo canes watched the rally but did
generally not interfere.
   Gandhi told a news conference at New Delhi's international
airport, ``I believe this visit will be a new beginning for both
countries.''
   A border dispute has strained relations between China and India,
the world's two most populous countries, for nearly three decades.
China has more than 1 billion people, and India has about 800
million.
   Gandhi's visit to Beijing was the first by an Indian prime
minister since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited China in
1954.
   The two countries issued a communique in Beijing earlier Friday,
agreeing to set up a joint working group to take up the territorial
dispute, which led to war in 1962. Gandhi said the group would set a
time frame in which to resolve the issue.
   The communique also said Chinese Premier Li Peng has accepted an
invitation to visit New Delhi, but no date was set.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier that
India says is part of its Arunachal Pradesh state. India also says
China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles in India's Kashmir
state.
   Gandhi also told reporters that Chinese leaders respected India's
views on Tibet, another sore point in relations. China invaded
mountainous Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later.
   The communique noted that China ``expressed concern over
anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that
the Indian side had repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a
part of China and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese
political activities on Indian soil.
   India has granted asylum to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's religious
leader, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Beijing blames
supporters of the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that
led to clashes with police in the last 14 months.
   India and China on Thursday signed three agreements _ a civil
aviation accord calling for direct flights between New Delhi and
Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement, and a science and
technology pact.
