<LEADPARA>  P.V. Narasimha Rao, a former foreign minister and loyalist of slain Congress
Party leader Rajiv Gandhi, was appointed prime minister-designate today and
charged with forming the next government.;    President Ramaswamy Venkataraman
chose Rao and gave him four weeks to present a government to Parliament and
prove it can command a majority.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I feel humble and confident," Rao said after meeting the president at his
official mansion.;    The appointment followed Rao's unanimous selection for
the post by the Congress Party's newly elected parliamentary delegation. That
occurred after rival Sharad Pawar said he was withdrawing his candidacy for
the sake of party unity. Pawar, a powerful Bombay-based politician, is chief
minister of the western state of Maharashtra.;    "As an individual, I feel
overwhelmed. As the representative of a great party, I feel like a colossus,"
Rao said in accepting the party's nomination.;    Congress won the lion's
share of votes in national elections that concluded Saturday, but fell short
of a majority. Rao's first task will be to shore up his government, either in
a coalition or by guaranteeing reliable support from an outside party for a
minority government.;    Leftist parties and the centrist National Front
alliance say they will back a Congress government on the merits of each issue.
But none has shown interest in joining a coalition committed to blanket
support to the government.;    Until Pawar's withdrawal, the party had feared
a bitter power struggle among regional leaders. Rao is a veteran politician
from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh who was foreign minister under Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.;    After Indira Gandhi's 1984 assassination, Rao
remained in the Cabinet under Rajiv Gandhi, who served as prime minister from
his mother's death until 1989.;    The party leadership fell vacant when Rajiv
Gandhi was assassinated May 21 while attempting a political comeback, and Rao
was chosen party president after Gandhi's Italian-born widow, Sonia, refused
to accept the post.;    After a show of hands confirmed Rao's election as
prime minister today, the meeting chairman, Sita Ram Desari said: "I declare
Mr. Narasimha Rao unanimously elected as leader of the Congress parliamentary
party.";    Rao's selection was greeted with cheers and shouts of "Rajiv
Gandhi is immortal.";    Referring to Gandhi, Rao told the 200 Congress
delegates that "sometimes the responsibilities of the great fall on someone
who is not great. Since you cannot bring them back, you just have to carry
on.";    He added: "We owe it Rajiv Gandhi, to his memory, to the party and to
the country to implement his manifesto to the hilt.";    Rao, who is 69 and
has undergone a heart bypass operation, did not run for a seat in Parliament.
Indian law requires the head of government to be a member of Parliament, and
he must win a by-election within six months.;    The governing party can
guarantee a victory by running Rao in a constituency vacated by the death of a
lawmaker, or by having a party member resign in a district where Congress
would be judged a shoo-in.;    Pawar endorsed Rao's election, citing Rao's
five decades of experience in the party and in government. "His total
contribution to the Congress Party is more than my age," said Pawar, who is
50.;    Rao had played a key role in the election campaign, writing the
party's manifesto, which calls for encouraging high-tech foreign investment
while remaining committed to the longstanding notion of a self-sufficient
economy.  </TEXT>
