  [Excerpts] The prime minister has declared that his 
government will go ahead with the economic liberalization 
process, ensuring that Indianness and identity of the nation is 
not diminished in any way. He said the present transition in 
the economic sector aims at accomplishing a liberal trading 
regime to overcome the macroeconomic crisis. 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the historic Humboldt 
University in Berlin today. He called for a determined fight 
against prejudices to help create a new humanism based on trust 
and respect for one another. He said we should live up to our 
worthy heritage by harmonizing our energies to promote 
Indo-German relations. The prime minister said it is a matter 
of pride for him to be in a free, united Berlin. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to inaugurate the Indian 
Cultural Center at Berlin later tonight, before leaving for New 
Delhi at the end of his four-day state visit to Germany. 
  Briefing newsmen, an official spokesman described the prime 
minister's visit to Germany as a landmark. He said the German 
industry and business got the opportunity to have an in-depth 
understanding of what is happening in India on the 
liberalization front. He said the meetings the prime minister 
had with German industrialists provided an opportunity for 
face-to-face interaction.
