   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi arrived in the
Chinese capital Monday in the first visit to China by an Indian
leader since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, came 34 years ago.
   Gandhi flew into Beijing on a special Air India jet provided for
the trip. His usual plane remained in New Delhi because rats had
gnawed electrical cables in the aircraft.
   The five-day visit marks the first time the leaders of the
world's two most populous countries have met since 1960, when
Premier Chou Enlai went to New Delhi. China has about 1.08 billion
people, and India has about 880 million.
   Gandhi will meet with the communist government's leaders in
Beijing, tour the ancient city of Xian and visit Shanghai.
   On arrival at the airport, the Indian prime minister, wearing a
brown overcoat, was greeted by about 100 Indians who live in
Beijing. He made no statement to reporters.
   Before leaving his country, Gandhi said the visit will be ``very
important ... for this globe, for Asia and for both of us.''
   The two nations are expected to sign agreements on civil
aviation, border trade, and science and technology. Consular offices
in the Chinese city of Shanghai and the Indian city of Bombay may
also be established as a result.
   However, little progress is expected on the main issue dividing
the two countries, their 2,400-mile-long border. They fought a brief
border war in 1962, and China occupied about 15,000 square miles of
Indian territory that India still wants back.
   The two countries began border talks in 1981 but made little
progress in eight rounds.
   India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize
Communist China soon after China's 1949 revolution.
   In the early 1960s, relations deteriorated over the border issue
as well as personal and political disagreements between Chinese
leader Mao Tse-tung and Prime Minister Nehru.
   In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when China began
emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations, instead of
exporting communist revolution.
   Both Chinese and Indian officials say Gandhi's visit is intended
to create an atmosphere for greater communication _ not resolve the
border question.
