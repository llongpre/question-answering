  [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement 
of Dharamsala in northern India was calm Sunday [24 April], but 
tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight 
triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here. 
  The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile issued an appeal to the 
residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during 
this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual 
leader's office in New Delhi said Sunday. 
  Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts 
of 
violence from anyone" and the Indians in Dharamsala were asked 
to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two 
communities. 
  Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a 
hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people 
injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks 
went on the rampage Friday. 
  The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old 
Indian 
youth in a knife fight Thursday night with a Tibetan refugee, 
who also was injured and hospitalised. 
  Police reinforcements have reached Dharamsala, where the 
authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a 
Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the 
Dalai Lama's office said. 
  "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there 
is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian 
leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the 
rioting. 
  He said the incident which sparked the riots was an 
altercation between two individuals and "no one should take 
steps which will result in communal tension." 
  Dharamsala has been home to the Dalai Lama and the seat of 
his government-in-exile since he fled Tibet in 1959 following an 
abortive anti-Chinese uprising. India is home to about 100,000 
Tibetan exiles. 
  The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the United 
States and expected to return May 1. 
  His government-in-exile used Sunday's statement to express 
Tibetan gratitude to India for "coming to our help at this 
critical period in our history." 
  "Tibet and India have had close spiritual and cultural ties 
for centuries," the statement said. "The Dalai Lama has always 
been reminding our people that the relationship between India 
and Tibet is that of a teacher and a disciple."
