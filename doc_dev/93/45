<LEADPARA>  The centrist Congress Party, winners of India's general election, sought today
to find coalition partners to form the next government.;    Senior Congress
leaders also have the task of finding a premier who won't cause a power
struggle in India, where elections had been delayed by the assassination of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Nearly 300 people were killed during the campaign and the voting, making it
the most violent balloting since India gained independence 44 years ago.;   
The latest victim was a parliament candidate from Punjab state who was killed
today in a bomb blast in his home, Press Trust of India reported.;   
Elections in Punjab are scheduled Saturday for both Parliament and the state
legislature. Punjab was given a later date than the rest of this nation of 844
million people in order to bolster security measures.;    Sikh militias
campaigning for an independent nation have vowed to stop the elections. So far
they have killed three candidates for Parliament and at least 19 for the state
legislature.;    The Congress Party, which has ruled India for 40 years, will
dominate Parliament but was projected to fall about 40 seats short of the 256
needed for a majority, state-run television said.;    Small-party allies and
independents could give Congress an additional 20 supporters in the Lok Sabha,
or the House of the People. It would, therefore, need to court coalition
partners among its political rivals.;    Party President P.V. Narasimha Rao
said Congress would try to choose its leader in Parliament. Rao spoke in the
drawing room of his New Delhi bungalow after meeting a half-dozen other party
bosses.;    The Indian Express newspaper today said Rao and regional leader
Sharad Pawar were in the running to be the next prime minister.;    Pawar is
the chief minister, the top elected official, of western Maharashtra state,
whose capital is Bombay. He was considered in a strong position because the
Congress Party won 37 of the state's 47 parliamentary districts.;    "The
process of consultation is on, but we have nothing definite to offer," party
spokesman Pranab Mukherjee said today. "The election of the leader will have
to wait until all the results are declared.";    The counting is not expected
to be completed until Wednesday.;    With 438 of the 511 seats at stake
decided, the Congress won 213, television reported. Its small-party allies won
another 12. Partial returns from other districts showed the Congress would win
only about 15 of the remaining 73 seats, television said.  </TEXT>
