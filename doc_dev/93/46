  [Text] The prime minister returned to New Delhi this 
morning on the completion of his week-long visit to the United 
States. Mr. Narasimha Rao was received at the airport by the 
home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan; the civil aviation and tourism 
minister, Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad; and the Harayana chief minister, 
Mr. Bhajan Lal, besides others. 
  As reported the prime minister's arrival in New Delhi was 
slightly delayed as Air India's special aircraft carrying him 
and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while 
landing at Paris for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft 
already stationed at Charles de Gaulle Airport was used for the 
onward journey home. 
  India-American business leaders have proposed creating two 
new institutions on Wall Street in New York to chalk out 
programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by 
the Greater Houston Partnership, the plan was presented to the 
finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who accompanied the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his just concluded U.S. visit. 
A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages 
creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and 
equity instruments to raise capital for India in the next 
decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least $100 
billion by the U.S. private industries for Indian markets in the 
next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the 
capacity to fund $5 billion per year for the modernization of 
the country's industry. 
  The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Atal 
behari Vajpayee, has lauded the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, for not succumbing to U.S. pressure on the issues of 
Kashmir and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Talking to 
newsmen in Lucknow, Mr. Vajpayee expressed satisfaction on the 
firm stand taken on these points.
