  [Text] Koenigswinter (DPA) -- The Dalai Lama has 
encouraged the FRG to take over responsibility in international 
politics. He hopes that, as a result of its special historical 
development, Germany will play an important role in establishing 
world peace, the secular and spiritual head of Tibet said in 
Koenigswinter near Bonn on Saturday [30 April]. 
  The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India for 35 
years, 
pointed to the "particularly friendly relations" between Germany 
and China. However, this should not lead to a strong tolerance 
toward the Chinese Government. Germany has the opportunity to 
influence Chinese policy. The 58-year-old man stressed that 
awareness of the special situation in his homeland is widespread 
among the German public. 
  The Nobel Peace Prize laureate affirmed his path of 
nonviolence. "I am, on principle, against the use of weapons." 
This is also the basis of the support granted to the Tibetan 
people by the world public. The Dalai Lama is paying a 
three-day visit to Germany on the invitation of the 
Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, which is affiliated with the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany.
