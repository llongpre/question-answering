   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles
in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of Red
Army troops from Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new
approaches to international affairs,'' Gorbachev said at a ceremony
where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   ``Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to
rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that
are obvious,'' Gorbachev said on the second day of his three-day
state visit to India.
   The Soviet Union agreed in April to withdraw its estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan, and about half the troops have
left. Soviet troops entered in December 1979 and have been helping
the Marxist government battle U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of continuing to
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a challenge by the Soviet republic
of Estonia to Kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of
``perestroika,'' or social change promoted by the Soviet leader.
Estonia's parliament this week declared Estonia was sovereign and
has the right to veto Soviet laws.
   In his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Gorbachev said:
``There is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem. I am sure
things will settle down.''
   The Soviet leader also said good relations between the Soviet
Union, China and India were necessary for peace in the Asia-Pacific
region.
   ``We are pleased to see signs of improvement in Indo-Chinese
relations,'' he said. ``Our own relations with China are also
evolving in an encouraging way.''
   ``Thinking of countries like the Soviet Union, India and China,
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them
are extremely important for the destinies of Asia and for global
progress.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month, the first Indian head of government to visit the country
in 34 years. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is scheduled to visit
Moscow early next year.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have had long-standing border
problems with China. India and China fought a brief war in 1962 over
the issue.
   Gorbachev's comments on the unrest in the Baltic states were made
informally to reporters at a memorial to Mrs. Gandhi, which he
visited before the award ceremony.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, placed a wreath of red
roses at Mrs. Gandhi's memorial. He placed similar floral tributes
at memorials to her father and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, and to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the hero of India's
freedom movement.
   An estimated 7,000 Afghan refugees, many of them opposed to
Soviet military involvement in their homeland, were confined to
their homes in New Delhi under police order for a second day. One
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any
embarrassment to the Soviet leader.
   The order asked Afghans not to ``move out of your residence till
21.11.88. ... Non-compliance of the order will render you liable for
prosecution.''
   The Afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations
every morning for a head count, the officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Gorbachev has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of
Soviet-Indian relations. In an apparent reference to China,
Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third countries''
would not affect the Kremlin's friendly ties with India.
   Both India and the Soviet Union have showed signs of easing
long-standing strains in relations with China, prompting concerns
expressed by some Indian newspapers and some Indian officials about
shifts in the political balances in Asia.
