<LEADPARA>  The party of India's slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi closeted itself
in New Delhi on Monday to select a leader after failing to win a clear mandate
to govern.;    Citizens, meanwhile, expressed relief mixed with disgust in the
wake of the landmark elections that cost tens of millions of dollars, left
hundreds dead and produced no clear winners to lead the country out of its
economic, social and political crises.  </LEADPARA>

CONGRESS WON'T GET MAJORITY OF SEATS IN INDIA'S
ELECTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Final, official results were not expected to be known in all of the
contests until today or Wednesday. As of Monday, Gandhi's party, the
century-old Congress, had clearly emerged as the nation's largest single
political force.;    But results from most of the 511 seats at stake in the
national Parliament indicated that the long-ruling party would still fall
short of a majority, with a final total of about 220 seats. And several
Congress leaders have made clear that, while picking a leader behind closed
doors, they will also be discussing possible alliances, either through
political defection or horse-trading, that would break the parliamentary
deadlock and give Congress sufficient strength to rule.;    The process may
last for several days, deepening the concern of an already cynical electorate.
After the bloodiest election campaign in India's 44 years of independence
claimed more than 300 lives and left India deeply polarized, voters turned out
in the lowest numbers ever.;    Most Congress leaders were cagey about their
next moves as the final returns were coming in Monday night.;    Many of the
party's younger, regional power brokers have said that they wanted the party's
next leader to be selected by secret ballot.;    Without such a secret ballot,
most party insiders said, the most likely "consensus" candidate for a future
Congress prime minister, to be chosen by an 18-member committee dominated by
veteran followers of Gandhi's family, is 70-year-old veteran legislator P.V.
Narasimha Rao, who was selected as a compromise, interim party president when
Gandhi's widow, Sonia, flatly refused the job.  </TEXT>
