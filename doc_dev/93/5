  [Text] India and Germany have expressed concern at the 
dangers posed by religious extremism. The prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for immediate 
steps to check the spread of this threat. Briefing newsmen on 
the one-to-one talks between Mr. Rao and Dr. Kohl, an official 
spokesman said in Bonn that the two leaders discussed 
Indo-Pakistan relations. The prime minister reiterated that 
India is in favor of peaceful relations with Pakistan. Mr. Rao, 
however, regretted that despite New Delhi's efforts, the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has taken a 
strident view. Referring to the package of proposals offered by 
India following the recent foreign secretary-level talks, Mr. 
Rao expressed the hope that continuance of worthwhile dialogue 
will yield positive results. During the talks, Bonn promised to 
take steps to speed up access of German technology to India. 
The German chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, said bottlenecks, if 
any, will be removed. He promised to support India in its 
dealings with the European Union. Germany has a prominent place 
in the Union. Our correspondent, S. Sudarshanam, understands 
that Mr. Rao spoke about human rights environment in India and 
the steps taken to protect and promote the human rights 
aspirations of the people. Earlier, the German foreign affairs 
minister, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, called on the prime minister. 
  The prime minister is visiting Berlin later today. Our 
special correspondent, Karuppaswamy, reports: 
  [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] Berlin is one of the very big 
cities in the world outside India with a full-fledged museum 
dedicated exclusively to Indian art. There are several streets 
named after Ravindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indira 
Gandhi. And Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose visited the city for 
the possible assistance during freedom struggle. Mr. Narasimha 
Rao will be received by the federal president, Dr. Richard Von 
Weizsacker. His engagements during his two days of visit to 
Berlin include a meeting with the governing mayor of the city, 
the German indologists, and representatives of the industry and 
commerce. [end recording]
