  [Text] The Rao-Clinton joint news conference just 
concluded. When all of us were coming down the stairs of the 
White House after the conference, a young journalist from 
Gujarat, who was a member of the prime minister's entourage, 
loudly told a senior journalist from THE WASHINGTON POST, "Had 
this been our country then at least for the sake of courtesy, we 
would have asked your president some questions, but you have 
insulted our prime minister by not asking him any questions." 
The American journalist was not at all offended by this remark. 
He smiled and softly told the youth to come with his prime 
minister when he visits the White House after five years. He 
then added that at that time, you will not find us as 
indifferent. 
  This spontaneous anger of the unexperienced Indian 
journalist 
was 100 percent genuine. It is really difficult for 
professional Indian journalists to tolerate the disregard shown 
toward their prime minister by American journalists. This 
proves that American journalists do not give any importance to 
the country where about one sixth of the total world population 
lives. 
  Rajiv Gandhi was able to create a lot of enthusiasm in the 
U.S. media during his first visit to the United States in 1985, 
but Narasimha Rao failed to generate even a fraction of that 
enthusiasm. The major U.S. newspapers gave wide coverage to the 
press conference which was addressed by Rajiv Gandhi at the 
National Press Club in Washington. This time, the newspapers 
thought it a waste to spare space to cover Rao. During Rajiv 
Gandhi's visit, THE NEW YORK TIMES criticized the Reagan 
administration for trying to impress Gandhi by showing robots to 
him. The newspaper said "India must be reckoned with in deeper 
terms than by displaying robots or space capsules to as 
sophisticated a man as Rajiv Gandhi." This time, due to the 
request made by the Indian Embassy, only THE WASHINGTON POST 
agreed to write a short report on Rao's visit. It wrote: "A 
small bald figure in a Congress Party grey suit, a man with a 
shy manner and a low voice, a man who is a total stranger to the 
(?sound bite) [as published], the Indian prime minister is not 
easily recognizable as a politician." It is unfortunate for the 
senior, learned, and experienced prime minister of India that 
popular television networks like NBC or ABC did not feel it 
necessary to give even one minute's coverage to him. 
  Did Rao really deserve the neglect which was shown him by 
the 
U.S. media? Rajiv Gandhi was able to attract American 
journalists due to his amiable disposition, westernized outlook, 
and alluring personality. Rao had something valuable in his 
pocket which the Americans should have been attracted to, that 
is, a market economy. The media did not give much importance to 
Narasimha Rao this time as they are not very aware of the 
developments which are taking place in the Indian subcontinent. 
Despite this, there is no denying the fact that India will soon 
become very important to the U.S. media just as China has 
become. The Clinton administration was reluctant to give most 
favored nation treatment to Beijing as its human rights record 
was not satisfactory. This enraged the U.S. media. The U.S. 
media is of the opinion that nothing should be done which would 
hamper bilateral trade ties with China. 
  Americans continuously shed tears for the cause of 
democracy, 
but why is the U.S. media so keen to keep the communist 
dictators of Beijing happy. This is so because their only 
objective is trade. If Beijing does not get most favored nation 
status due to the rashness of Clinton, then U.S. industrialists 
will be affected and the interests of the country will be 
hampered. Their main objective is to protect the economic 
interests of the United States. It should be achieved at any 
cost even if it is necessary to renounce the country's policies. 
It has been observed that Beijing did not make any special 
efforts to secure most favored nation status. The industrial 
corporations and the U.S. media are working together to protect 
the interests of the Chinese leaders, Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. 
  India will also be able to acquire this importance after 
the United States becomes involved in its market. The first and 
foremost requirement is to attract U.S. capital. During his 
visit to the United States, to some extent Narasimha Rao has 
been able to attract U.S. businessmen to India. This is the 
most significant aspect of his visit to that country. These 
people were able to realize the amount of profit they can make 
by investing in India. It is true they have been impressed by 
the reform measures initiated by Rao and Manmohan. U.S. 
businessmen have started realizing that this country of hermits 
and snake charmers have a middle class population of about 200 
million people, who have great purchasing power. There was no 
one in the United States to speak in favor of India in the past. 
At present, a lobby of industrialists has been formed in favor 
of India. Some key persons of giant U.S. corporations have also 
joined this group. A new horizon of prospects has been created 
in front of their eyes -- the largest free market of the 21st 
century. 
  Their eagerness towards this country is new and it must be 
admitted that India will gain from it. The first benefit is 
economic. This is because India is desperately in need of 
foreign capital, particularly in the sphere of infrastructure. 
The second gain is political. Due to growing U.S. interests in 
India, other sensitive political issues like Kashmir and the 
nonproliferation issue will gradually lose significance. 
President Clinton and his colleagues did not make any attempt 
to embarrass Rao on these issues during his recent visit. The 
main reason behind this is pressure from industrialists. If the 
United States remains passive on these issues, then Islamabad 
will have to suffer. In fact, it is the intention of India to 
blunt the sharp mouth of Islamabad. 
  To sum up, it may be said that in this post Cold War era, it 
is essential to improve ties with the United States. It is 
necessary to play the economic card well to establish this 
relationship. Narasimha Rao's visit has created prospects for 
the establishment of friendly relations between the two 
countries. This relationship will be further strengthened if 
the pledges given by Rao and Manmohan regarding economic reforms 
are speedily implemented. Once capital is invested in this 
country, then it is bound to influence the White House and the 
U.S. media. After this, if the Indian prime minister goes to 
address a joint news conference with the U.S. president, then 
all cameras will be focussed on the Indian prime minister. This 
will fulfill the predictions made by the American journalist to 
the Gujarati youth.
