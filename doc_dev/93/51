   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
began a three-day visit to India today, pledging to maintain warm
relations with Indian despite ``comments and speculations'' to the
contrary.
   In an apparent reference to an improvement in both nations' ties
with China, Gorbachev said ``the development of relations with third
countries'' would not affect Soviet-Indian relations.
   Gorbachev's remarks were contained in a speech given at a dinner
attended by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the first day of the
Soviet leader's three-day visit to India.
   Indian authorities, mindful of Afghan refugee opposition to
Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, asked the estimated 7,000 Afghans
living in New Delhi to stay in their homes while Gorbachev is in
town.
   Gorbachev did not mention China in his speech, a text of which
was released by the Indian Foreign Ministry.
   But it followed concerns expressed by some Indian newspapers and
by some Indian officials that warmer relations between the world's
two biggest communist powers could affect Moscow's friendly ties
with India.
   Referring to ``some comments and speculations that are not
exactly friendly,'' Gorbachev said: ``Some go as far as saying that
the Soviet Union is changing its priorities, even becoming cool to
India. ...
   ``I shall not dignify with an answer such totally groundless and
obviously speculative remarks,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev's visit to India, his second in two years, comes a
month before Gandhi is to travel to Beijing, the first trip to China
by an Indian prime minister in 34 years.
   India and China have a longstanding border dispute and went to
war in 1962.
   There also are signs of an easing of strains between Moscow and
Beijing, highlighted by next year's scheduled Moscow visit by senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa arrived in New Delhi to a welcome
marked by tons of roses decking the highway taken by his motorcade.
It was his first trip abroad since the title of presidency was added
to his position as party leader nearly two months ago.
   After a ceremonial reception, Gorbachev held the first of at
least four scheduled talks with Gandhi.
   An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, who under briefing rules
cannot be identified, said the two leaders discussed general global
and regional matters but did not discuss specifics.
   Schools were closed today in honor of Gorbachev's visit. More
than 100,000 students and 10,000 teachers were asked to stand along
the Soviet motorcade route, newspapers reported.
   Afghan refugees said they have been instructed to stay off the
streets, except to report to their nearest police stations every
morning while Gorbachev is here.
   ``The police want to make sure all heads are accounted for,''
said Syed Mohammad Maiwand, chairman of the International Afghan
Elders Association, which claims 1,300 members in New Delhi. ``They
are treating us as if we were criminals.''
   India, a founding member of the movement of non-aligned nations,
has friendly relations with Moscow and Washington. But the Soviets
are a chief supplier of military equipment, including jet fighter
planes and tanks.
   On Wednesday, the two countries signed a trade agreement for
imports and exports worth $4.7 billion in 1989 _ more than double
the estimated $1.9 billion for 1987.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to return to Moscow on Sunday.
