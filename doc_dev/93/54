  [Text] The Indo-German relations and cooperation in 
industry and scientific development has a new vigor with the 
visit of the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, to Germany. The 
Germans also take cognizance of the importance of such a visit 
when Germany is renewing its outside endeavor and enagement 
after two and a half years of internal problem of unification. 
Businessmen and industrialists along with the government were 
very busy during the last two years. Inactivities concerned 
with creating parity between the two Germanys radically opposed 
with each in everything except the geographical contiguity 
artificially separated by a manmade wall [sentence as heard]. 
  Germany is now looking for new grounds for investing and 
adequate return for their investment. The economic reforms 
toward globalization of market in India has made Germany 
immensely interested in collaboration. Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
assurance to the German industrialists that India is pressing 
ahead with economic reforms is a reassurance to many of them for 
removing their hesitation to open new units or financing Indian 
projects. The creation of an Asian-Pacific Committee of German 
Industry is a major step toward consolidating Indo-German 
cooperation. The low labor cost and skill of workers and the 
fairly unexploited market in India is the most potential market 
for German industrialists. The meeting between the prime 
minister and the federal minister for economic development and 
the German cochairman of the Indo-German Consultative Group in 
Bonn has paved the way for narrowing down some of the 
constraints. 
  India's largest trading partner and market for Indian export 
in Europe will further invite Indian exports of silk, textiles, 
leather, basic chemicals, precious stones and engineering item. 
On their side, investment in lignite-based power plants, joint 
ventures like power equipment and scientific and institutional 
establishments are some of the added German ventures in India 
contemplated immediately. The German Investment Development 
Company, which has an office in Bombay, is accelerating its 
involvement in speeding up implementing the 2,500 approved 
projects for collaboration. In all, Germany is expected to 
exploit the scheme with the potentials of 75,000 rupees. 
  Politically, the Indo-German relations are always cordial 
and 
consistent with adequate understanding in international fora. 
Germans are well aware of the fact that India was one among the 
first to establish diplomatic relations with Germany after the 
withdrawal of allied forces. The unequivocal stand of Germany 
on developments in Kashmir and its neutrality speaks of its 
noninterference in other country's affairs. Such friendly 
attitude and closer economic ties are bound to reflect in 
Indo-German growth as viable economic powers.
