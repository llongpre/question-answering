  [Text] The prime minister has arrived in Washington for 
wide-ranging talks with President Clinton. During his stay in 
the U.S. capital, Mr. Narasimha Rao will meet the decision 
makers and exchange views on bilateral and international 
matters. He will address the joint meeting of the U.S. Congress 
today. The Rao-Clinton talks tomorrow are expected to break new 
ground in bilateral relations. This will be their first meeting 
and also the first high-level contact between the two countries 
since the end of the cold war. Expansion of economic 
cooperation and better appreciation of each other's stand on 
issues like nuclear nonproliferation are likely to be the focus. 
Indian officials say that the Clinton Administration wanted the 
summit meeting to cover the situation in Russia, the role of the 
United Nations in peacekeeping, and the Nonaligned Movement. 
  Shortly before leaving for Washington, Mr. Narasimha Rao 
said 
in Boston that an important purpose of his current visit is to 
invite America to join the Indian efforts for speedy 
industrialization and infrastructure development. Delivering 
the (Joe Deddy) memorial lecture at the Harvard University, the 
prime minister said true North-South cooperation demands 
collaboration between the developed countries which have a huge 
research and development base and the developing countries. He 
also called for development of new technologies that can result 
in creation of maximum number of jobs at minimum cost. The (Joe 
Deddy) memorial lecture established in 1955 is for the promotion 
of tolerance, understanding, and goodwill among the nations, 
particularly the East and the West. Rajiv Gandhi and V.S. 
Naipaul were the prominent personalities who delivered the 
lecture in the past. The prime minister spoke at length about 
the Indian scene and the economic reform process. He said 
globalization of economies should be on the basis of partnership 
and should be a smooth affair. Amid lusty cheers from the 
audience, Mr. Rao declared that despite occasional clashes and 
agitations India will remain united with its unmatched 
attractions. 
  The former U.S. ambassador to India and noted economist, 
Professor Galbraith, introducing the prime minister to the 1,000 
strong student audience said India is America's most enduring 
friend. Prof. Galbraith said the bilateral relations are deep 
rooted and the so-called concerns belong to the realm of 
bureaucrats.
