  [Text] The summit meeting between the prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, and the U.S. President, Mr. Clinton, will take 
place in Washington on the 19th of next month. An External 
Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi today that the 
overall program of the prime minister's visit to the United 
States is being worked out. The Indian Embassy in Washington is 
in touch with the U.S. State Department. The visit is in 
response to an invitation by the U.S. President. The two 
leaders are expected to exchange views on major international 
issues. They will also discuss measures to consolidate and 
strengthen bilateral relations. 
  The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, 
has said that the United States wanted to clear 
misunderstandings with India and wants to establish sound 
relations. Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha today, 
he said the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao will visit 
USA to keep the dialogue open with that country as a part of 
maintaining cordial relations with it. He said a senior 
diplomat has gone to London [as heard] to hold discussions with 
the U.S. officials as the prime minister is to make a visit to 
that country. The prime minister's visit, Mr. Bhatia said, is 
to hold discussions at the highest level to narrow down 
differences between the two countries on the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty], regional security, disarmament, and 
other issues.
