fault?

MR PV Narasimha Rao's political fortunes are at their lowest ebb since he
became prime minister.
Brought in hurriedly to lead the ruling Congress (I) party in mid-1991 after
the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Rao proved remarkably adept at
enhancing his own and his party's power during his first year in office. He
won praise at home and abroad for supervising the launch of India's most
extensive economic reform programme.
But Mr Rao's reputation has slumped since last summer: financial scandal,
growing party concern about the impact of reform on political patronage,
and, above all, Ayodhya have undermined the prime minister's reputation. He
is pilloried as the leader who cannot lead, as a man who cannot take
difficult decisions at a time when India faces hard choices.
There is some truth in the criticisms. But Mr Rao's reluctance to make these
choices is as much a reflection of his party's weaknesses as of his own. It
is as much Congress as Mr Rao which is cautious about pushing ahead further
with economic liberalisation and about mounting a coherent challenge to the
forces of Hindu militancy in the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. For
better or for worse, Congress has the leader which it deserves.
Mr Rao, who was born into a high-caste Brahmin family in 1921 and is a
lawyer by training, won acclaim as a scholar and a poet before going into
politics in his home state of Andhra Pradesh, in the south, in the late
1950s. He worked his way up the Congress party, winning praise for his
skills as a backroom organiser rather than a platform politician.
His first job in Delhi was in 1974, when he became general secretary of the
All-India Congress Committee. He served Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv
Gandhi as foreign minister, home minister and minister for human resource
development.
But while he worked well in the salons of Delhi, he rather neglected his
home state and, unlike other Congress leaders, never built a strong personal
power base.
Loyalty to the Gandhis made Mr Rao an ideal candidate to replace Rajiv
Gandhi in the midst of a general election. He was best able to capitalise on
a wave of public sympathy which brought Congress back to power, propelling
Mr Rao into the prime minister's chair. At the time, many Congress members
did not expect Mr Rao to stay in office long, with other leading figures
such as Mr Arjun Singh, the human resources development minister, and Mr
Sharad Pawar, then defence minister, angling for the top post.
But Mr Rao has skilfully contained the ambitions of both: Mr Pawar has been
sent back to his home state of Maharashtra to deal with the aftermath of the
riots and terrorist bombs in Bombay. Mr Singh remains in Delhi, a thorn in
the prime minister's side, but one he has learnt to live with.
Mr Rao did not have the slightest intention of promoting economic reform
when he came to office. But the reform agenda was thrust upon him by the
mid-1991 balance of payments crisis.
It also provided a good opportunity to steal some of the thunder from the
BJP, which had openly advocated economic liberalisation from the late 1980s.
Mr Rao borrowed their policies wholesale.
Mr Rao's low-key approach helped Dr Manmohan Singh, his finance minister,
secure the support needed for reform. Mr Rao patiently persuaded Congress
members that there was no option but liberalisation if India was to pull out
of the crisis.
But caution and clever tactics have not proved enough to deal with the next
two pressing problems on the agenda - how to pursue further economic reform
and how to deal with the BJP.
As far as further reform is concerned, Mr Rao is probably more than happy to
postpone difficult decisions. His party shows little inclination to make
controversial moves, such as selling loss-making public enterprises,
modernising bankruptcy laws or permitting employers to dismiss redundant
workers.
With economic growth now back at about 5 per cent, foreign exchange reserves
high and exports soaring, Congress members are not at all convinced that
further radical reforms of any kind are necessary, let alone the kind which
might bring job cuts.
The BJP is quite a different matter. Mr Rao has tried to ride out the storm
caused by the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque.
Whether his policy has been right will be shown in the state elections in
the four northern states in November and December. But there are strong
indications that Congress has lost ground to the BJP in the last year and to
the left-of-centre parties including Janata Dal.
For this, Mr Rao is now under intense, if largely silent, pressure from
critics inside Congress, including Mr Arjun Singh. If Congress fares badly
at the polls, these critics will want Mr Rao out.
Congress as a whole is as much to blame as Mr Rao for failing to confront
the BJP successfully. Like the prime minister, the party is plagued with
doubts about whether it is better to confront Hindu militancy or to
compromise with it. The prime minister's personal shortcoming has been his
inability to promote with sufficient force an alternative agenda to the
BJP's religious zeal. Economic reform is such an alternative. But, apart
from Dr Manmohan Singh, no-one in the present cabinet has staked much
political capital on liberalisation. Certainly not Mr Rao.
