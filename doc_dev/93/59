   Thousands of Tibetan refugees lined the
streets and monks blew traditional horns today to welcome home
their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who returned to his
mountain abode with the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi earlier, where he was
showered with flowers and presented with silk scarves. The Budhist
monk then traveled to Dharmsala, his Himalayan home-in-exile for
the past 30 years.
   About 5,000 cheering refugees from the 100,000-member Tibetan
community exiled in India lined the 5-mile route from the airport
to the Dalai Lama's mountaintop headquarters.
   The 54-year-old Dalai Lama was traveling in the United States
when he was named winner of the prestigious prize on Oct. 5 for his
non-violent quest to free Tibet from Chinese rule.
   Monks at the Nangyal monastery blew traditional Tibetan horns as
he drove through the town 300 miles north of New Delhi, which is
home to most Tibetan refugees living in India.
   Priests at a local church rang bells as the Dalai Lama's
motorcade passed. Several Western tourists watched, displaying
placards that read, ``Congratulations and Welcome.''
   The Tibetan government-in-exile declared today a public holiday
and announced a public reception later in the day.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
Since then, he has continued to advocate non-violence as the only
means to achieve Tibetan independence.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that China retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   Beijing insists Tibet has been an integral part of China since
the 13th century. The Chinese government has said it will talk with
the Dalai Lama if he renounces Tibetan independence.
   China has condemned the Nobel award as an insult and
interference in its internal affairs.
