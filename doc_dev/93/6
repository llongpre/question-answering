   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India ended a visit
to China today with the two nations expressing a common desire to
improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations.
   Gandhi, accompanied by his wife, Sonia, departed for home from
Shanghai after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head of
government since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited in 1954.
   Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will
between the world's most populous nations. Gandhi said his trip
marked a ``new beginning'' for the two countries.
   During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint working
group to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial dispute
that broke out into a short border war in 1962.
   ``The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depth
discussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed to
settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,''
a joint communique said.
   It added, ``They also agreed to develop their relations actively
in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and
conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary
question.''
   It said Gandhi's talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng were held
``in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutual
understanding.'' Gandhi also met with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang and President Yang Shangkun.
   The border issue, Gandhi said, is ``very complicated'' and a
quick solution is unlikely.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   The communique said China ``expressed concern over anti-China
activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that the Indian
side repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a part of China and
banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities
on Indian soil.
   India has been the home of Tibet's religious leader, the Dalai
Lama, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. China blames supporters of
the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that have led to
violent clashes with police the past 14 months.
   Gandhi on Thursday presided over the signing of three bilateral
agreements _a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights
between New Delhi and Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement and a
science and technology agreement.
   The communique said Premier Li accepted an invitation to visit
India, but no date was set.
   China, grappling with economic problems at home, has made a
commitment to improving relations with its neighbors.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to visit China
next year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years.
   China will likely normalize relations with the Soviet Union
during the visit. The two countries fought a border war in 1969.
