<F P=106> [Editorial: "Practical Success"] </F>
  [Text] It is impractical to look for a spectacular outcome 
to the Rao-Clinton talks; this was not expected from Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao's U.S. visit. There were already 
indications that no solution would be found to the differences 
between India and America, and it was not expected that India's 
standing would suddenly rise in the eyes of U.S. statesmen and 
businessmen. The only hope was that the summit meeting between 
India and America would produce a better understanding, which 
had been weak for a number of years. With this personal 
communication between the heads of government of the two 
countries, more businesslike ties might develop between India 
and America. Relations have previously been bogged down in a 
quagmire of bureaucratic language and prejudice. 
  From this point of view, Narasimha Rao's visit can be termed 
a success. In his joint news conference, the prime minister 
stated that the talks were "constructive, useful, and 
forthright." The forthrightness is reflected in the fact that 
both leaders agreed there are differences that still persist. 
India reiterated its stance regarding the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty], human rights, and Kashmir, but America 
remained steadfast in its reasoning. The talks were useful in 
the sense that India could properly gauge U.S. priorities for 
the first time. For his part, the prime minister tried to 
emphasize not only that India is the largest democratic country 
with a potential to emerge as the greatest market in the world, 
but its humanitarian and pacifist concerns are no less than 
those of America. 
  The constructive nature of the talks will only become known 
in the future. The prime minister proposed that for the sake of 
a nuclear-free world there should be agreement on "no first 
strike" with nuclear weapons. He also agreed that a program of 
joint exercises between Indian and U.S. forces should be 
undertaken to safeguard South Asian and Pacific security. If 
these things are considered constructive, that is one matter; 
the true usefulness of the prime minister's visit was the 
possibility of heavy U.S. investment in India. How far 
Narasimha Rao succeeded in this regard will become known only 
after concrete results are achieved. 
  The prime minister's visit proved useful in one sense. Even 
though President Clinton declared India the biggest successful 
democracy and praised its contributions, this feeling was 
neither reflected in the U.S. media nor in the behavior of U.S. 
senators. The U.S. media ignored the prime minister's visit from 
the beginning, and when they did notice, they treated it as an 
insignificant event. U.S. statesmen were so indifferent toward 
the prime minister's address to a joint session of Congress that 
only three dozen members from both houses came to listen. 
Newspapers ignored the event completely. Most of the questions 
asked in the joint news conference were addressed to President 
Clinton, and many had no bearing on Indo-U.S. relations. This 
indifference came despite the fact that this was the first state 
visit by an Indian prime minister in many years; Rajiv Gandhi 
was the last prime minister to visit the United States. This 
attitude has nothing to do with the prime minister's success or 
failure, but the inherent fact that India is not a U.S. priority 
cannot be ignored. It is therefore easy to understand that in 
the present atmosphere we will not be able to carve the proper 
niche for ourselves in Western politics -- which move on the 
basis of power and prosperity -- by extolling goodwill and our 
cultural superiority. India is not considered great on the 
basis of population, natural resources, or democratic tradition. 
It will have to transfer these attributes into solid results. 
It is futile to repeat Jawaharlal's prophecy that the next 
century would be a U.S. century; we will have to find a strategy 
to make the next century belong to India.
