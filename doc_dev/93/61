  [Text] Top U.S. business executives have offered to make 
big investments in India. The rich Indian-American community 
has also indicated plans to provide their expertise and money 
for giving a push to the market friendly reform process. At 
their separate meetings with the prime minister, now on an 
official tour of the United States, both American companies and 
the NRIs [nonresident Indians] appreciated the economic 
liberalization policy and said it has transformed India into a 
prospective market for greater inflow of funds. Mr. Narasimha 
Rao assured them that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board 
will look into any irritants in materializing their projects. 
  Our correspondent Rama Rao covering the prime minister's 
visit reports that the NRI plans include investments in highway 
construction and communications, as also mobilization of at 
least $2 billion every year. Mr. Narasimha Rao told the NRIs 
that they can play their legitimate role in the 
industrialization of the country and their investments have to 
increase as they go along. 
  Addressing a large section of the Indian-American community 
in New York, the prime minister said India means business and 
the future course is clear. His current visit is to project the 
giant leap the country is poised to take in industrial 
development and to give a personal undertaking over the 
irreversibility of the changed course. Mr. Rao asked the NRIs 
to participate in the present efforts based on their sound 
economic judgment. Commending the NRIs for the good work done 
in the country where they are living, he said they should keep 
it up. About Indo-U.S. ties, the prime minister said these need 
to be strong and friendly, not only for mutual benefit but for 
the future of mankind as a whole. The importance of his visit, 
he said, goes beyond the scope of normal bilateral relations. 
  The prime minister has since arrived in Houston on the 
second 
leg of his American tour. Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to 
meet the chief executives and presidents of major companies 
under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The 
partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the 
city. Later, the mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys 
of the city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. He will also attend a 
reception by the Indian community before leaving for Boston 
tomorrow.
