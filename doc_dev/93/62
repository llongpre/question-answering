  [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United 
States has become quite a controversial issue now. A feeling 
has emerged that the Clinton Administration is trying to 
blackmail us and force us into a situation that binds our hands. 
  The global situation today has made the United States a 
superpower. It is resorting to various types of tricks to make 
us sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] when in Asia, 
Pakistan and China possess nuclear weapons. 
  The United States has been keeping an eye on us after we 
successfully test-fired the five missiles -- Agni, Prithvi, 
Akash, Trishul, and Nag. At first, it supported Pakistan on the 
Kashmir issue and later calmed down after the resolution on 
Kashmir was defeated at the Geneva Human Rights Conference. 
  The United States could not prevent China from continuing to 
manufacture nuclear weapons. It has decided to provide F-16 
fighter planes to the Benazir Bhutto government. 
  With the help of these aircraft, Pakistan can easily target 
our numerous vital installations, including nuclear power 
plants, and destroy them. A long border exists between India 
and China. It is a historical fact that even when China-India 
friendship was flourishing, China invaded us in 1962 and 
committed aggression against our territory. Nevertheless, while 
Chinese strength is emerging, the United States wants us to halt 
even the tests of missiles like "Agni". 
  There is a feeling that India floundered during the recent 
talks between the representatives of India and the United States 
in London. However, the prime minister has, time and again, 
said that we will not succumb to any pressure on the NPT. 
  The events occurring after the visit of U.S. Deputy 
Secretary 
of State Talbott, however, conform to the prevailing view that 
the United States is stepping up its pressure on India. 
  Earlier, there was a report that Dr. Abdul Kalam, the great 
scientist hailing from Ramanathapuram, who is known as the 
"father of missiles" would be transferred from his post. 
Opposition leader Vajpayee raised the question whether this 
scientist, who brought laurels to the country by producing 
"Agni," was going to retire. The government immediately 
announced that that Dr. Abdul Kalam's tenure would continue. 
  The NPT is discriminatory. What is the justification for the 
countries who have already amassed a lot of lethal nuclear 
weapons, to ask a country, which has acquired only the technical 
know-how, to sign the NPT first? Our thinking so far has been 
that the NPT will not apply to India. 
  The situation changed a little since signing the GATT 
accord. 
An opinion has emerged that as stated by the United States, 
5+2+2 [the five recognized nuclear powers plus Germany and Japan 
plus India and Pakistan] countries can hold talks on the subject. 
  Our government has not made any categorical announcements on 
this in the parliament. Opposition leader Vajpayee says that 
the prime minister should assure that he will not discuss 
anything other than economic issues during his visit to the 
United States. 
  Leaders like Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and the 
ruling party's Professor Tiwari are apprehensive that the prime 
minister's visit can culminate in some dangerous consequences. 
  Political observers opine that Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's 
first meeting with President Clinton will create problems when 
Clinton's political maneuvers are totally against India. 
  Among international circles, it has clearly been felt that 
Clinton, who is very particular about providing the F-16 nuclear 
bomb carrier to Pakistan, is trying to arrest India's growth and 
crush it. 
  About 20 years ago a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran 
in 
Rajasthan on 18 May 1974, for peaceful purposes only. That 
underground test made it clear to the world that we have the 
capability to manufacture nuclear bombs. 
  Subsequent prime ministers, however, including Indira 
Gandhi, 
did not show interest in conducting nuclear bomb tests. 
  Thereafter, India made several achievements in nuclear 
energy. Today, we are also in a position to manufacture nuclear 
weapons by taking a few steps. Chidambaram, the chief of the 
Department of Atomic Energy [name and title as published] has 
said: There is nothing that India cannot accomplish. 
  At first, the five countries -- United States, Soviet Union, 
China, the United Kingdom, and France -- have been recognized as 
nuclear powers. But, as per the accord on nuclear 
nonproliferation in 1967, it was decided that barring these five 
countries, no one should manufacture nuclear weapons. The 
accord reached in this connection is called the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, known as the NPT. So far, 140 
countries have signed it. 
  Iraq also signed the treaty, but it manufactured nuclear 
bombs by producing plutonium. South Africa is another country 
which signed the treaty but covertly manufactured nuclear bombs. 
North Korea also did the same thing. 
  So far, several countries, including India, Pakistan, and 
Israel have not signed the treaty. The funny thing is that 
Israel has been put on the list of honorary countries possessing 
nuclear capability. 
  No one has ever tried to prevent the countries that 
legitimately manufacture nuclear weapons in the name of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or to eliminate the threat they 
pose. On the other hand, the United States is using this treaty 
as a tool to prevent several peaceful projects, including the 
launching of satellites. On this basis only, it put 
restrictions on Russia in supplying cryogenic engines even to 
India. Therefore, not only India, but France, Argentina, China, 
South Africa have not accepted the NPT. 
  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus possess nuclear weapons. 
  Hence, including Germany and Japan with the already existing 
five nuclear countries, there are seven countries manufacturing 
nuclear weapons. By adding India and Pakistan, it has been 
calculated that there are five+two+two nuclear countries. The 
United States wants all of them to end their nuclear tests. 
  As a first step, the United States wants the halting of 
tests 
for all missile programs, including "Agni". 
  If the Agni, Akash, and Trishul missiles are installed on 
our 
borders, they will help us face any attack from Pakistan or 
China. 
  Already, due to resource constraints, we are not able to 
provide the armed forces with the necessary sophisticated 
weapons. Under these circumstances, if important missiles like 
"Agni" are crippled, it will benefit certain countries such as 
Pakistan. 
  Therefore, the Rao government is constrained to convince the 
people that the country should go nuclear. Otherwise, as 
India's enemies could wage a war against it at any time, it has 
no recourse other than face a very delicate situation. Only 
after this realization, several reports about the pressure 
exerted by the United States began appearing. The Indian 
Government is also constrained to explain to the people and the 
parliament about its position every now and then.
