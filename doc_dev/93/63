   India and China signed a civil aviation agreement
and two other accords Thursday during a summit that Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi said marks a new beginning in Chinese-Indian
relations.
   The agreements gave some concrete substance to a trip by the
Indian leader intended mainly as a symbolic restoration of good
relations between two nations representing a third of the world's
population.
   The two sides agreed in principle to establish direct air links
between New Delhi and Beijing. They also signed a three-year
cultural exchange program agreement and a science and technology
accord calling for contacts between the scientific communities of
the two countries.
   After meeting with elder statesman Deng Xiaoping, Gandhi said New
Delhi's troubled relations with Beijing seemed but a memory.
   ``We agreed on almost everything that was spoken of,'' Gandhi
said.
   The comment was a bit surprising from a man who has come to power
under the shadow of bad relations with Beijing. But it made sense in
the light of Gandhi's goals in China.
   Gandhi is the first Indian prime minister to come to China since
his grandfather, Prime Minister Jawaharal Nehru, journeyed here in
1954 to celebrate the two countries' close ties.
   Gandhi's five-day trip, which began Monday, marks the first time
Chinese and Indian leaders have met since 1960 when the late Premier
Chou Enlai went to New Dehli.
   Relations turned sour in the early 1960s because of personal and
political disputes between Nehru and Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung. A
border war broke out in 1962.
   In the past 26 years, relations have improved slightly. Border
negotiations started in 1981 as has a small amount of trade. But
little has really changed and the border today remains tense.
   It was to break this political logjam that Gandhi came to China.
He sought, as he said, to rekindle the spirit of ``peace and
goodwill'' between the two most populous nations of the world.
   His first two days were filled with talks on the border, China's
troubled province of Tibet, which lies just north of India, and
trade. But it was his discussion with Deng that seemingly interested
Gandhi the most.
   The meeting began shortly after 10:30 a.m.
   ``Welcome, my young friend,'' the 84-year-old Chinese leader said
to Gandhi, 44, as he took the prime minister's hand.
   ``Beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as
friends,'' Deng said. ``The two countries' leaders will become
friends, the countries will become friends, the people will become
friends.''
   And then, as if he was talking to a schoolboy, Deng added: ``You
agree, don't you?''
   ``I agree,'' Gandhi replied.
   Deng told Gandhi that he had met Nehru during his visit to
Beijing in 1954.
   ``In the considerable period of time in between there was
unpleasantness with each other,'' Deng said.
   With a sudden wave of his arm, the Chinese leader commanded,
``But let us forget all that. We should be looking forward.''
   Deng said he had sent messages to Gandhi's mother, Indira Gandhi,
in the 1980s when she was prime minister.
   ``At that time our countries had some contact,'' Deng said. ``But
the genuine start in the improvement of our relations is your visit,
so I wish to thank you.''
   Sitting back in the overstuffed chairs in Fujian Hall in the
cavernous Great Hall of the People, the two embarked upon an
analysis of international political and economic affairs.
   ``The difference between the countries of the North and South are
getting bigger and bigger,`` Deng was quoted as saying by the
nationally televised news. ``True development won't be achieved
until all of mankind has achieved a certain level.''
   Gandhi said Deng impressed him.
   ``I found that almost everything he spoke of was what we have
been working for for these last 40 years,'' Gandhi said later at a
news conference. ``Working for a new political order that doesn't
look to blocs, that doesn't look to confrontation as a solution,
working for a new economic order more equitable and just.''
   For Gandhi, his visit with Deng marked the highlight of his trip
because he was seeking symbols and not substance.
   Indeed, the tangible ``achievements'' _ agreements on civil
aviation, science and technology, and cultural exchanges _ are small.
   But for Gandhi, a friendly meeting with Deng was apparently the
sign he had wanted. The political logjam is broken.
   ``We have agreed that we can and should move ahead,'' the young
leader said at the news conference after meeting Deng. ``We have
laid the foundation for a peaceful, stable and cooperative
relationship between our two countries.''
