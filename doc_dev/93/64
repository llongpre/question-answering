  [Text] New Delhi 19 April, TASS -- Ukraine and India are 
prepared to contribute to the strengthening of peace and 
cooperation in South Asia, jointly seek universal and complete 
nuclear disarmament and to eliminate existing hot beds of 
tension through political means, this was underscored during 
talks today between Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasimha Rao 
and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is here on an 
offical visit. 
  The head of the Ukrainian foreign affairs department 
expressed support for India's fight for strengthening its 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zlenko 
emphasised that Indian leadership's stand for the destruction of 
all nuclear arsenals in conformation with the plan of action for 
the creation of a nuclear- free world, which was worked out by 
former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is regarded with 
understanding in Kiev. 
  P.V. Narasimha Rao expressed support for practical steps 
taken by Ukraine to achieve non-nuclear status. The head of the 
Indian Government highly appreciated Kiev's contribution to 
strengthen stability in the world and the development of equal 
and partner-like relations between all members of the world 
community. The two sides reaffirmed their interest in the 
continuation of consultations between the two countries on 
questions of bilateral and international issues on a permanent 
basis. 
  The same day Zlenko held talks with Indian Foreign Minister 
Dinesh Singh. It was stressed during the meeting that India 
attaches great importance to relations with Ukraine which bear a 
progressive character, especially in the sphere of economics. 
Dinesh Singh, in particular, expressed India's readiness to 
provide necessary assistance to Ukraine in the implementation of 
its wide- ranging economic reform programmes and transition 
towards a market economy. 
  India and Ukraine signed today agreements on setting up a 
Ukrainian-Indian intergovernmental commission for trade, 
economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation, a 
protocol on consultations between Foreign Ministries of the two 
countries and other documents.
