  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI) -- India and China will soon 
start talks on reducing troop-levels on both sides of the line 
of actual control (LAC) in pursuance of an agreement signed 
during the Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Beijing 
last September, Chinese ambassador Cheng Ruisheng, said in an 
interview here. 
  "Both sides may have already reduced some troops, but I am 
not aware of the facts. Both sides want to divert their 
resources from military to economic development," Mr Cheng said. 
  The Chinese ambassador said that an experts group of 
diplomats and military personnel, set up as part of the 
agreement on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the 
LAC, would hold its first meeting in New Delhi next month. 
  He said the experts group would tackle the issue relating to 
the redeployment with a view to reduction in military forces in 
the areas along the LAC. 
  The experts group, which will have about 10 members from 
each 
side, shall advise the Foreign Secretary-level joint working 
group (JWG) on the resolution of differences between the two 
sides on the alignment of the line of actual control. 
  Replying to wide-ranging questions, Mr. Cheng said there was 
no Pakistan factor in China's development of relations with 
India. 
  Describing "stability and overall improvement" as the main 
characteristics of the Sino-Indian relations in 1993, he said if 
China used India or Pakistan as a card for developing bilateral 
relations, it would "complicate matters very much." 
  He emphasised that India and China had achieved a 
breakthrough in exchanges in the military field. 
  The visit of the Chinese vice chief of Army staff to India 
last month came after a gap of over 30 years. Like-wise, the 
Chinese naval ships visited Bombay nearly after 40 years. 
  India and China had problems in 1962 but that was part of 
history now. "We are trying to catch up with the lost time," the 
Chinese envoy said. 
  He emphasised that there was no such gap in the development 
of China's relations with Pakistan. 
  Mr. Cheng agreed with the questioner that the human rights 
issue was being exploited by the west. 
  The Chinese envoy said India and China had identical views 
on 
the human rights issue. 
  "We are of the opinion that differences on the human rights 
issue should not be linked with bilateral relations including 
trade or economic ties," he said. 
  Replying to a question on the nuclear issue, Mr. Cheng 
referred to differing perceptions between India and China. 
  China had already signed the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty. India was not prepared to do the same, he observed. 
  Mr. Cheng said his country was in favour of a nuclear 
weapons 
free zone in South Asia as there was no nuclear power in the 
region. 
  China, he said, felt that the two major world powers should 
reduce their nuclear weapons. 
  Asked about the Chinese military assistance to Pakistan, he 
said this did not pose any threat to India. 
  He made the point that China was involved in commercial 
sales 
of military hardware and India could also be a buyer if it so 
desired.
