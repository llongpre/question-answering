  [Text] The government today categorically assured 
Parliament that it will not give in to any pressure on the NPT 
[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] issue, neither will there be 
any change in India's stand that the NPT should be universal and 
nondiscriminatory. 
  Allaying apprehensions expressed by opposition members on 
the 
London talks between Indian and U.S. officials, the 
parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, in the Lok 
Sabha and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman 
Khurshid, in the Rajya Sabha made it clear that there is 
absolutely no rethinking on the NPT issue. Mr. Shukla said 
there is no secrecy about the talks and it was held in London 
only because it was convenient to both the sides. Describing 
the talks as preparatory to the prime minister's forthcoming 
visit to the United States, he urged the members to ensure that 
both Parliament and the people strengthen the hands of Mr. 
Narasimha Rao in safeguarding the nation's interests. Mr. 
Shukla said that whenever summit meetings are planned, such 
preparatory talks are held to discuss various points which will 
come up. 
  Mr. Salman Khurshid said that government will abide by the 
Rajiv Gandhi action plan on nuclear disarmament; and earlier 
raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr. 
Saifuddin Chaudhary and other opposition leaders demanded a 
statement on the London talks, as it has created apprehensions 
in the minds of the people because of various press reports 
about the secrecy of the meeting. Raising the issue in the Rajya 
Sabha, Mr. J.P. Mathur, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], said that 
utterances by the U.S. officials have hurt the self-respect of 
the country.
