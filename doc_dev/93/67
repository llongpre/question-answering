   Chinese troops rounded up suspected separatists
and kept a tight lid on Tibet today as the embattled region marked
the 30th anniversary of a failed attempt to cast off Chinese rule.
   Police and the military already had detained many Tibetans in
house-to-house searches and planned to move swiftly to crush any
demonstrations to commemorate the anniversary, according to Tibetan
and foreign sources.
   A Tibetan woman, contacted by telephone today, said the capital
was calm and that the army occupied all roads.
   ``There are new arrests ... There are many, but we don't know how
many,'' she said.
   A man came on the line.
   ``Don't talk a long time,'' he said. ``There are a lot of police.
We can't talk long.''
   China imposed martial law in Lhasa on Tuesday to quell three days
of anti-Chinese riots that took 16 lives, according to official
count. Western travelers say most Tibetans put the death toll at
between 20 and 30. Some estimates ranged much higher.
   All foreign tourists were ordered to leave Lhasa by Thursday. It
was believed the last group departed this morning.
   Another Tibetan woman reached by telephone Thursday evening from
Beijing said Chinese troops began rounding up large numbers of
Tibetans after most foreigners left.
   China's national radio today said large groups of protesters
turned themselves in and that police said those who gave themselves
up would be treated with leniency.
   It said some shops had reopened in the mountaintop city of
70,000, and the Barkhor, the central marketplace, was returning to
life.
   During the riots that began Sunday, mobs of Tibetans demanding
independence from China and chanting loyalty to their exiled
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama threw stones, ransacked
Chinese-owned shops, set fire to Chinese property and attacked
government office buildings.
   The Dalai Lama spoke today to about 5,000 ethnic Tibetans in
Dharmsala, India, who gathered to mark the 1959 uprising. He urged
Tibetans to demonstrate against Chinese rule but avoid violence.
   ``The non-violent struggle is the best because of the recent
events,'' he said. ``Have faith in the struggle and continue
demonstrations so that the world will know Tibet is suffering under
Chinese rule.''
   He called on Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to end violence in the
Tibetan capital, according to a statement issued by his headquarters
in New Delhi.
   ``I urge your personal intervention for bringing an immediate end
to the repressive measures against innocent Tibetans and lifting of
the martial law in Lhasa,'' the statement said.
   Thousands of Tibtetans also demonstrated in New Delhi and the
Indian city of Madras today.
   China's leading newspaper today issued a plea for calm and said
that without stability, economic reforms would fail.
   ``The riots in Lhasa ... show how precious stability is to the
(economic) modernization and how important it is for the peace and
happiness of the people. Without stability, nothing will be
accomplished,'' said the front-page editorial in the People's Daily.
   For the Chinese, the March 10 anniversary marked the beginning of
``democratic reform'' in Tibet, the institution of Communist
political and economic systems in the remote Himalayan region.
   Tibetans remember the day in 1959 when tens of thousands
converged on the Dalai Lama's palace to prevent what they thought
was a Chinese military attempt to kidnap their god-king.
   A week later, the Chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into
the palace ground, and the Dalai Lama and his family fled secretly
that night, eventually reaching India. The Dalai Lama and about
100,000 followers now reside in exile in northern India.
   Following the Dalai Lama's flight, the Chinese army moved in to
destroy the Tibetan resistance, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands,
before order was restored.
   China says Tibet has been part of its territory for seven
centuries. Many Tibetans say their land was independent before the
Red Army moved into it in 1950, and they seek a sovereign state
under the Dalai Lama.
   The 53-year-old Dalai Lama, worshiped as a reincarnation of past
Dalai Lamas, has offered to accept Chinese control over Tibet's
defense and foreign policy in exchange for greater autonomy.
   China rejects the proposal but says it is willing to talk to the
Buddhist leader.
