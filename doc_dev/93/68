   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the offspring of leaders who
helped feed the bitter feud between their nations, were ``getting
along famously'' on Friday, sources said.
   Ms. Bhutto, who took office four weeks ago, met Gandhi for the
first time Thursday when he arrived in Islamabad for a seven-nation
South Asian summit that has been overshadowed by meetings between
the leaders of the region's two mightiest powers.
   The two held a second private meeting Friday, and Indian sources
said the talks were friendly and productive.
   ``Their talks have been very warm, very cordial,'' an Indian
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said there was
hope for ``a new face on the relationship between the two countries,
one of warmth, trust and confidence.''
   Another Indian source said: ``They're getting along famously.''
Pakistani officials declined comment on the talks.
   Before Gandhi returns to New Delhi on Saturday, India and
Pakistan are expected to sign three agreements, including one in
which the countries agree not to attack each other's nuclear
installations, Indian sources said.
   The others provide for cultural exchanges and an end to double
taxation in trade and commerce.
   The signings appear to be largely symbolic and designed to
emphasize hopes that new leadership in Pakistan will lead to better
relations with India.
   The cultural and taxation agreements were initialed about a year
ago by both countries.
   A verbal agreement on the nuclear non-attack pact was reached
three years ago during a visit to New Delhi by President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, the army general who overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father,
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977. Bhutto was subsequently
executed after being convicted of what he said was a trumped-up
charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent.
   Zia was among those killed Aug. 17 in an explosion that destroyed
an aircraft over Pakistan.
   Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi's first private meeting began at 9 p.m.
Thursday and lasted until 1:30 a.m., Indian sources say. The only
other people present were Ms. Bhutto's husband, businessman Asif
Zardari, and Gandhi's wife, Sonia.
   On Friday, the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers attended an
all-day session with the leaders of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Bhutan and the Maldives as part of the fourth annual summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
   Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto then met again for more than two hours.
They were joined midway through the meeting by their foreign
ministers, Narasimha Rao of India and Yaqub Khan of Pakistan.
   The talks ``covered the whole gamut'' of problems between the
nations, including disputes in Kashmir and Punjab, the Indian
official said.
   In the last five years, Punjab has been the scene of India's
worst violence. More than 2,400 people were killed in the border
state this year by Sikh separatists. India claims Pakistan aids the
extremists. Pakistan denies this.
   Gandhi's mother and immediate predecessor, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984,
four months after she ordered an army raid on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar, where Sikh militants were holed up. More than 2,000
people, mostly Sikhs, were killed.
   The Kashmir border dispute dates back to 1947 when Moslem
Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India were partitioned along
religious lines. India claims a portion of the region lying in
Pakistan.
   The Indian official declined to give any details of Ms. Bhutto
and Gandhi's discussions, but said the leaders did more than outline
problems but discussed ``what we will be able to do about them.''
   Gandhi is to meet again with Ms. Bhutto on Saturday.
   Other participants in the summit are President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad of Bangladesh, President Junius R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka,
President Maymoon Abdul Gayoom of the Maldives, King Birendra of
Nepal and King Jigme Singhe Wangchuk of Bhutan.
