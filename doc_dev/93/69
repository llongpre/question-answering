  [Text] India and China will soon start talks on reducing 
troop levels on both sides of the Line of Actual Control. This 
is in pursuance of an agreement signed during the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to Beijing during September 
last year. The Chinese ambassador, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, said in 
New Delhi that an expert group of diplomats and military 
personnel set up as part of the agreement will hold its talks in 
the capital next month. He said both the countries want to 
divert their resources from military to economic development. 
He also said that a high-level delegation of the Communist 
Party of China will be on a week-long visit to India from 
seventh of this month at the invitation of the Congress-I. A 
festival of India will be held in China in May this year, he 
added.
