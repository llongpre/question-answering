   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and China's
president, Yang Shangkun, today discussed China's troubled region of
Tibet, and Gandhi said his country will not interfere in China's
internal affairs.
   The Indian leader spent much of his second day in China
sightseeing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Yang explained China's
position on Tibet to Gandhi during a one-hour meeting at the Great
Hall of the People.
   Yang, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president
since April, stressed that the Beijing government provides
assistance to the Tibetan region, one of China's most backward areas.
   ``We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the
Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,''
Yang said.
   Gandhi repeated India's position that Tibet is an autonomous
region of China and that India will not interfere in China's
internal affairs, Xinhua said.
   The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the
two countries because India has provided refuge to the Tibetan
religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his followers, who have
demanded independence for Tibet. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after he led a failed uprising against Chinese military forces.
   At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by Chinese security
forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on
Dec. 10. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in Lhasa
in the past 14 months.
   China and India are trying to restore friendly ties after a
quarter century of soured relations, which hit bottom during a
21-day border war in 1962.
   The border question was the main topic during talks Monday
between Gandhi and China's Premier Li Peng.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of what India says is part of
its northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claims 14,500 square
miles of land seized by China in 1962.
   Gandhi and Li, however, vowed not to let the border problem
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to visit China since his
grandfather, former Prime Minister Jawalharlal Nehru, came in 1954.
   Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, Sonia, Gandhi today
traveled about 37 miles northwest of Beijing to the Badaling section
of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a
2,000-year period to keep out invaders.
   The Indian leader also visited the Temple of Heaven, a 15th
century structure where China's emperors once prayed for good
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals.
   On Wednesday, Gandhi is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang.
   The two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation,
border trade, science and technology and the exchange of consular
offices in Shanghai and Bombay.
