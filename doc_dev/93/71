<F P=106> [Commentary by H.S. Rao of PTI] </F>
  [Text] A great deal of importance was attached to the visit 
of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe Talbott, to 
India and Pakistan. In New Delhi, the first (?stop) on his 
first foreign trip as U.S. deputy secretary of state, Strobe 
Talbott has had cordial and frank exchange of views with Indian 
leaders, including the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao. 
During the discussions spreading over two days, Indian leaders 
conveyed India's concern on the proposed U.S. move to transfer 
F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. There were even indications that the 
U.S. persistence with the supply could cast a cloud over the 
prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Washington. 
  As New Delhi sees it, F-16's would adversely affect the 
strategic balance against it in the region, forcing India to 
take appropriate measures diverting the much-needed resources 
from economic welfare programs and setting back the process of 
economic reforms. The future course of Indo-U.S. relations, it 
was clear, would be shaped by Washington's response to India's 
concern. As expected, Mr. Talbott defended the U.S. proposal in 
his talks at various levels, the ground that it was linked with 
the nuclear nonproliferation obligations on the part of 
Islamabad and that the aircraft would be transferred only if 
Pakistan agreed to verifiable cap on the production of weapon 
grade material. [sentence as heard] However, he told his hosts 
in New Delhi that he had noted India's strong views. 
  During the talks, Mr. Talbott was plainly told of the 
prevailing popular sentiment in India against the U.S. tilt 
toward Pakistan in [word indistinct] of the cold war attitude. 
India as was told did not like third parties to look for 
equality, parity, or balance between India and Pakistan. The 
territorial integrity of the country would not be sacrificed, 
the Indian side said, while emphasizing that Jammu and Kashmir 
was part of India. Mr. Talbott dealt with the tilt perception 
at his press conference. As he put it, the very word tilt 
belongs to the vocabulary of the past and specifically to the 
vocabulary of the cold war. The U.S. has good relations with a 
number of countries in the area -- certainly with India and 
certainly with Pakistan. On Kashmir, the position of Clinton 
administration, he said, is very simple and consistent. The 
United States hopes very much that India and Pakistan will be 
able to resolve this matter themselves as per the Simla 
Agreement. 
  Forty-seven year-old Talbott, a former TIME magazine editor 
and columnist, is a close friend of President Clinton. They 
shared a room as Rhodes scholars at Oxford University a quarter 
century ago. When Clinton visited Washington as governor of 
Arkansas, he often stayed at Talbott's home. One of the 
Talbott's assignments was to remove the sense of frustration in 
Indo-U.S. relations. After his one-hour long discussions with 
the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, Mr. Talbott observed 
that no one person (?is fit) to bring about better understanding 
and cooperation between India and the U.S. than Mr. Rao himself. 
He also announced that Mr. Rao has accepted in principle an 
invitation to visit the United States and Mr. Clinton looks 
forward to receiving Mr. Rao to make the most of what the two 
countries have in common. This itself is an indication of the 
positive aspect. But the same cannot be said about Mr. 
Talbott's diplomatic mission to Islamabad. 
  In Islamabad, Mr. Talbott held intensive talks with the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, President Farooq 
Leghari, and other leaders. On the whole, the talks were held 
in business-like fashion although cordiality and nostalgic 
memories of an old strategic relationship marked the 
discussions. Three major areas were covered. The issue of 
nuclear disarmament in the South Asian regional context, 
Kashmir, and the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral framework on the 
question of inspections to ensure the capping of Islamabad's 
nuclear armament program. A noticeable degree of convergence of 
objectives came into focus in respect of the U.S. proposal for 
multilateral forum to discuss nonproliferation in South Asia. 
On the other two issues, though Pakistan appeared to have given 
a patient hearing, no appreciation and nod from the U.S. was 
available. On Kashmir, he reiterated the U.S. stand that India 
and Pakistan should resolve it in accordance with the Simla 
agreement. This indicates Pakistan's failure either to secure a 
recognition of the linkage between Kashmir issue and nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia or to elicit a view that Kashmir, 
more than nuclear proliferation, is a complicating factor in 
this region. Mr. Talbott also refused to budge on the issue of 
verifiable cap on Pakistan's nuclear program and maintained that 
discussions would continue between the U.S. and Pakistan.
