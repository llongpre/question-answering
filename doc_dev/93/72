  [Text] The prime minister has asked the nonresident 
Indians, NRIs, to play their legitimate role in the speedy 
development of the country. Addressing a large gathering of 
NRIs in New York, Mr. Narasimha Rao asked them to evaluate for 
themselves the reform process without attaching any emotions. 
He emphatically stated that the economic changes underway in 
India are irreversible. The prime minister invited them to take 
advantage of the opportunities and invest in the country to help 
expand and strengthen the economic liberalization process. He 
said that structural hurdles posed at the initial stages have 
been overcome and there is a turnaround now. The prime minister 
appreciated the good work being carried out by the NRIs in 
various walks of life outside the country. 
  Our correspondent Rama Rao, covering the prime minister's 
visit, reports from New York that Mr. Narasimha Rao will be 
meeting the captains of industry at Houston today in the second 
leg of his visit to the United States. He described the visit 
as a step towards a strong, friendly, and cordial cooperation 
between the two great democracies of the world. During his 
one-day stay in Houston, the prime minister will be meeting the 
chief executive officers and presidents of the major companies 
under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The 
partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the 
city. The mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys of the 
city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. The prime minister will attend an 
Indian community reception before leaving for Boston tomorrow. 
  Our special correspondent Bhupal Inder Saini reports from 
Washington: 
  [Begin Saini recording] One of the primary objectives of the 
prime minister's goodwill visit to the United States is to 
explore the potentials and opportunities of stepping up 
Indo-American cooperation in the economic sphere. The United 
States is already India's largest trading partner and the 
economic reforms undertaken by New Delhi under Mr. Narasimha 
Rao's leadership had created tremendous opportunities for 
further stepping up economic links and trade. Significantly, a 
large number of leading Indian businessmen are also in the 
United States to tap the potential for tie-ups with American 
companies.
