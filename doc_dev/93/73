<DESCRIPT>  INDIA; LEADER; ELECTION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  P.V. Narasimha Rao, an ailing 69-year-old former foreign minister who has
loyally served the Congress Party for five decades, was chosen Thursday by the
party to serve as India's ninth prime minister.;    Aggressive efforts by
Sharad Pawar, the powerful Bombay-based party leader, to wrest the prime
minister's job from Rao, collapsed in midmorning under pressure from state
party bosses and loyalists who served under Rajiv Gandhi, the party leader who
was killed May 21.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state, was viewed by these critics as
too independent, too strong-willed and too determined to break the traditional
grip over the Congress Party by the "Hindi belt" of large northern states.;   
After Rao's unanimous selection by a show of hands of Congress Party
lawmakers, he was driven to the office of India's president, Ramaswamy
Venkataraman, for a 40-minute meeting.;    Rao (pronounced ROW, as in how)
will be sworn in today precisely at 12:50 p.m., which was deemed by his
astrologer to be a propitious moment for him.;    Rao, who must form a
coalition government in the next few weeks based on the recent national
election, is viewed as a caretaker leader, ill with heart problems, whose
ascendancy was designed to calm a party that was traumatized by the
assassination of Gandhi.;    Critics say Rao's long career, including such
powerful posts as home minister, defense minister and foreign minister, was
undistinguished and marked by an indecisiveness. He is viewed as a centrist,
without particular ideology, on foreign and domestic policy.;    Congress and
its allies won 236 seats in Parliament's law-making lower house, 20 short of a
majority. Rao will either shape a coalition or set up an arrangement that
guarantees outside support from another party to form a coalition.;    Rao
will have to win a seat in the lower house of Parliament six months after
being sworn in as prime minister -- a task that will probably be accomplished
by the Congress Party's removing or forcing a candidate in a safe seat to
resign.  </TEXT>
