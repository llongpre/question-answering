  [Text] The two-day AICC-I [All India Congress Committee-I] 
session has concluded with a call to find technology which can 
produce quality goods in the small-scale sector. Addressing the 
concluding session this evening in New Delhi, the party 
president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, said this is necessary for 
adopting Gandhian philosophy in the present context and to 
overcome the problem of social costs associated with this 
industry. He called upon the developed countries to join hands 
with developing nations in this campaign and said such programs 
should be innovative and time bound. 
  Making a dig at the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] for its 
demand that India should go nuclear, Mr. Rao reiterated that the 
country would keep its options open. The decision will be based 
on disarmament trends in the world. We cannot play with weapons 
of mass destruction, he observed. Mr. Rao said there can be no 
question of one upmanship in this matter. He charged some 
political parties with misleading the people over the issue. 
Mr. Narasimha Rao underlined the need for strengthening the 
party's setup at the village level in a time bound manner. The 
Congress-I president said that the practice of giving party 
tickets to the relatives of leaders should be stopped as it has 
created resentment among the rank and file.
