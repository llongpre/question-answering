  [Text] India won a stunning diplomatic victory in Geneva 
last night when Pakistan was forced to withdraw unconditionally 
its resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. 
Reports say the Pakistani decision came after its delegation 
realized that there was no prospect of the resolution being 
carried. Leading the way, Iran appealed to Pakistan not to 
press for the resolution just before the voting was scheduled to 
begin. The Iranian move was supported by China. Immediately 
after, delegate after delegate of the developing countries, 
including Syria and Indonesia, appealed to Pakistan to withdraw 
the resolution. Majority of the countries indicated that they 
would abstain from voting. They said the issue should be 
resolved through bilateral talks between the two sides. 
  The leader of the Indian delegation, Mr. Atal Behari 
Vajpayee, and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. 
Salman Khurshid, have expressed the satisfaction at the 
withdrawal of the resolution and called it a vindication of New 
Delhi's principled stand. 
  The leader of the Pakistani delegation said that Islamabad's 
move followed high-level consultations between Iran and Pakistan 
and the views of the majority of member countries. 
  The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, has thanked 
Iran and China for prevailing upon Pakistan to withdraw the 
resolution. In a statement in New Delhi, he expressed the hope 
that Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the 
Simla Agreement and desist from misleading the international 
community through false allegations of violations of human 
rights in India. 
  The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has complimented 
Mr. Vajpayee on phone for the excellent work done at the UN 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
