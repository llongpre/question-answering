   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev returned home from India last week without giving New Delhi what it most wanted -- unequivocal Soviet support for India's stance on the major issues affecting southern Asia. 

   Mr. Gorbachev's four-day visit did underscore the close ties between New Delhi and Moscow as well as India's recent animosity toward the U.S. 
But Mr. Gorbachev and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi fell short of publicly affirming each other's positions on relations in Asia and appeared to be on different wavelengths on matters of Asian strategy. 
Mr. Gandhi didn't back Soviet initiatives for an Asian security conference. 
And Mr. Gorbachev refused to be drawn into criticism of India's two regional rivals, Pakistan and China. 

   In a closing news conference, Mr. Gorbachev danced around attempts by the Indian press to have him dispel fears that a Soviet effort to mend fences with China would come at the expense of India. 
Instead, he advocated that India improve relations with its neighbors as well, something that, according to an Indian political scientist, "unnerved" many Indian officials and left-leaning intellectuals. 

   Although the Soviet leader massaged egos by referring to India as a major international power, he gave many Indians the impression that Moscow no longer looked upon India as the principal Asian country on which to base a political strategy. 

   "There was a certain sense of our being left out in the cold," said Mira Sinha, a specialist on Sino-Indian relations at Delhi University. 
"India didn't get an endorsement of regional concerns." 

   Still, the relationship between the two countries -- considered vital by both -- isn't in danger. 
Many political observers believe strong economic ties will remain and that the Soviets will continue to supply India with most of its arms. 

   Even among pro-Western Indians, there is growing bitterness toward the U.S. and what is seen here as needless and growing U.S. military support of Pakistan. 

   As expected, the Soviet Union and India signed a $2.2 billion economic agreement, the largest single economic pact ever signed between the two nations, according to Mr. Gandhi. 
The agreement, which provides for low-interest Soviet credits that can be repaid in Indian rupees, covers four major projects in India: a 2.4 million-kilowatt hydroelectric power station, modernization of a steel plant, onshore-oil exploration and digging of new coal fields.
