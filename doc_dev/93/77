  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--Mongolia considered Kashmir as 
an integral part of India and any outstanding issues between 
India and Pakistan should be "resolved within the ambit of the 
Shimla agreement, bilaterally." 
  This Mongolian position was conveyed by the visiting 
President, Mr Pansalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in unambiguous terms here 
on Tuesday to the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, during 
their meeting on Tuesday morning. 
  The Mongolian leader further felt that India's peaceful and 
non-violent approach was something to be emulated by the whole 
world. 
  The two leaders felt that bilateral cooperation between the 
two countries must be strengthened for mutual benefit and 
advantage. Mr Narasimha Rao referred to the joint committee now 
being set up at the just concluded round of summit talks would 
promote co-operation in the economic, science and technology 
areas. He further expressed the hope the joint committee would 
not only implement the decisions taken but should also identify 
new areas of cooperation. 
  The two leaders also discussed regional issues and felt that 
regional cooperation in Asia should be strengthened. 
  They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation in 
different areas such as, mining including exploration of uranium 
reserves in Mongolia, oil deposits, and agriculture and agreed 
that details should be worked out by the just set-up joint 
committee. 
  The two countries on Tuesday signed a treaty on friendly 
relations and co-operation between the two countries and four 
other agreements--(a) for establishing of a joint committee for 
economic commercial and science and technological cooperation, 
(b) avoidance of double taxation, (c) cultural exchange 
programme, 1994-96, and (d) cooperation in health, 1994-96. 
  Addressing a 40-minute press conference later in the day, 
the 
Mongolian President asserted that his visit to India "is very 
successful." With his meeting with the President, Dr Shankar 
Dayal Sharma, on Monday and the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday, his delegation has completed "main 
political agenda." He attached great importance to the 
strengthening of Mongolia's bilateral ties with India. He also 
attached paramount importance to the just signed treaty of 
friendly relations and cooperation as well as the setting up of 
the joint committee. 
  He pointed out that his country has great reserves of 
uranium 
and petroleum, and Mongolia is prepared to undertake 
feasibility studies with any country, including India. In reply 
to a specific question about possible Indian participation, the 
Mongolian leader's forthright reply was that his country "has no 
reservation with regard to any country.
