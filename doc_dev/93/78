<F P=106> [Editorial: "Superfluous 301"] </F>
  [Text] There are many reasons behind the U.S. decision to 
give India a two-month reprieve from the U.S. "Special" 301 
trade sword. One reason, perhaps, is the proposed Washington 
visit by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The subject of the 
Washington talks is going to be the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]; the imposition of Special 301 on the 
eve of these talks would have been an unnecessary diplomatic 
irritant. In addition, India and the United States hold 
divergent views on a number of issues. Questions about 
political-strategic issues are more serious than trade 
questions. All of this is going to be discussed by Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao and President Clinton. Therefore, it is 
impossible to understand why the U.S. Commerce Department 
brandished the Special 301 sword. Agreed, the previous 
two-month reprieve has just ended. Meanwhile, the official GATT 
accord has been confirmed, and India has signed it. The GATT 
preamble answers all the questions the U.S. Congress cited in 
proposing the Special 301 act. India's acceptance of the GATT's 
Dunkel draft should satisfy the U.S. Administration, and it 
should be thinking about ending Special 301. To the contrary, 
however, the United States has threatened to bring India under 
the purview of Special 301. 
  It seems that India must face Special 301 again because of 
China. China is going to become a GATT member; it has already 
applied. China had made an issue of the delay in approving its 
application. Until China joins the GATT agreement, the U.S. will 
continue to threaten it over U.S. patent and copyright issues. 
China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list. 
Therefore, India is being warned time and again because of 
China. Perhaps it is because of China that the U.S. Congress is 
not thinking about revoking Special 301, despite the GATT 
signing. China, India, and Argentina are the countries 
currently being threatened with Special 301. India and Argentina 
have already signed the GATT agreement. As a result, they must 
make changes in their patent and copyright laws in accordance 
with this agreement. GATT has allocated enough time for this. 
The United States is applying psychological pressure on them to 
enact new laws quickly by giving two months' warning. If India 
ignores this, nothing is going to happen. India should not care 
about Special 301 anymore. After all, why should the United 
States be accepted as a godfather in place of the new 
multilateral trade organization? All patent and copyright 
issues are now the concern of the new trade organization. How 
can the United States become a godfather in bilateral trade when 
a multilateral trade system is being launched? Perhaps the U.S. 
Administration refrained from applying Special 301 because it 
has a proper understanding of this perspective, and the Indian 
Government did not waste any time reacting to it.
