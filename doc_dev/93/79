<HEAD>Tibetan Women Arrested While Demonstrating for Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today arrested about 20 Tibetan
women who demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy to demand
independence for their homeland from Chinese rule.
   Officers outside the embassy struggled briefly with the women as
they tried to get into the building. ``We want independence!'' the
protesters shouted.
   The demonstrators, many of them weeping, were lifted by police
and carried to a waiting van. They were freed a short while later,
police said.
   Tibetan refugees in India regularly hold rallies outside the
Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and present memorandums demanding
freedom for their homeland.
   The rally today was the first by a Tibetan group in New Delhi
since Tibetans' spiritual and political leader, the Dalai Lama, won
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize on Oct. 5.
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the 1951 Chinese annexation.
   Most Tibetan refugees who have regularly streamed into India
since then live in the northern town of Dharmsala in the Himalayan
foothills and in New Delhi. The Dalai Lama has set up a
government-in-exile in Dharmsala, 250 miles north of New Delhi.
   China says it has ruled Tibet for more than seven centuries, but
many Tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that
time and ruled by a Buddhist theocracy.
