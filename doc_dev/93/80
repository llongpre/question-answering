<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Rao Trying To Please Both Sides?"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 28--The government's confused and 
even contradictory response to the London talks underscores the 
dilemma of the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Sources in 
the external affairs ministry say that in his one-to-one 
discussions with Mr Strobe Talbott, he conceded the U.S. demand 
for a multi-lateral conference. However, U.S. counterparts are 
claiming that the Prime Minister was quite definite in his 
commitment while Indian officials claim that the acceptance was 
conditional, the composition, agenda and modalities only being 
thrashed out now in the secret talks, now public knowledge. 
  Most observers accept that Mr Rao will knowingly never do 
anything against the country's interests, but many of them feel 
that the Prime Minister is attempting to undertake the 
near-impossible task of finessing a policy that will satisfy 
both the United States and Indian interests. The talks in 
London, the changed composition of the delegation indicate that 
Mr Rao thinks he can pull it off. 
  One section of the government believes that Mr Krishnan's 
brief is to stall for time and draw out the United States in 
discussions on modalities, composition and so on, and allow the 
Prime Minister to complete his U.S. visit. 
  However, another segment of the bureaucracy advocates 
caution, arguing that the U.S. does not function in this manner 
and will certainly obtain clear-cut Indian commitments before Mr 
Rao reaches Washington, so as to make the Indian Prime 
Minister's visit a substantive one from President Bill Clinton's 
side. Mr Clinton will then be able to tell the U.S. Congress 
that notwithstanding failures on other foreign policy fronts, 
India and Pakistan have been brought around to accept the U.S. 
non-proliferation agenda. 
  It may be recalled that in similar circumstances, in October 
1987, the United States had brought pressure to bear upon India 
to accept port calls from U.S. Navy ships involved in coercing 
Iran. 
  A few weeks prior to Rajiv Gandhi's American visit, the 
United States requested the visit of the USS 
Enterprise to Bombay. But when this was turned down on 
grounds that it went against India's policy of allowing ships 
carrying nuclear arms into Indian ports, the United States 
modified its request asking that only the cruise missile armed 
USS Missouri be permitted. When this too was turned 
down on similar grounds, the United States sent two other 
frigates, which in their own way began the process that ended in 
the Indo-U.S. joint naval exercise in 1992. 
  On second thoughts, the `secret' talks between India and the 
United States in London to decide, "the concept and agenda" for 
the multilateral talks on disarmament, appear even more curious. 
Yesterday in Parliament, the minister of state for external 
affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia told the Lok Sabha that this was the 
fourth round of bilateral official talks between India and the 
United States. However, the official spokesman declared that it 
was only "another round of bilateral discussions." 
  In response to a question, U.S. officials in New Delhi 
accepted that these were indeed official talks, but made it 
clear that they wished to "stay away from the numbers game," and 
refrained from commenting on whether this was the "fourth," or 
just "another" round of talks. This coyness conceals more 
substantive issues. 
  The three rounds of bilateral talks between India and the 
United States in February and May 1992 and September 1993--were 
between two equal parties discussing security and strategic 
issues. The London "secret" talks are a spin-off of these talks, 
which seek to create a multilateral format to resolve the South 
Asian "problem," by capping and eliminating India and Pakistan's 
nuclear and missile programmes. Here these two countries come 
under one category of "problem" states and the others--the 
United States, U.K., France, Russia, China, Japan and 
Germany--will be the guarantors of the Indo-Pakistani capping 
agreement. Needless to say, this goes not only against the grain 
of not just stated policy, but also Indian security interests. 
  United States' officials are being quite careful to note 
that 
not only are the talks official, since they are being conducted 
by U.S. officials like the deputy assistant secretary of state, 
Mr Robert Einhorn and Mr Norman Wulff, the acting assistant 
director of the non-proliferation bureau, but their presence 
together means that the key requirement of inter-agency 
consultation has been met. 
  In our case, such subtleties do not matter. There appears to 
have been no effort to consult the armed forces or the Ministry 
of Defence, leave alone the Ministry of External Affairs. Even 
more curious is the status of the leader of the Indian 
delegation. "Distinguished," "senior" and "experienced" are the 
adjectives being used to describe this former diplomat, but they 
cannot hide the fact that he is a retired official and is thus 
not quite accountable for his views or conduct to the government. 
  While the official spokesman says that such appointments are 
the prerogative of the government and that Mr Krishnan enjoys 
its confidence, it still does not answer all the queries about 
his mandate and status as well as the manner in which serving 
officials accompanying him are to deal with him. 
  Had he been given the status of a special envoy, such 
questions need not have risen. But then, it is clear by now, 
that the entire episode has been shoddily handled by the 
government that pointing to one issue is of little consequence.
