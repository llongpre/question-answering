  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's, 
four-day visit to Moscow from tomorrow will mark a new milestone 
in India-Russian relations. This was stated by the Indian 
ambassador in Russia, Mr. Ranendra Sen, to newsmen in Moscow. 
He said the process had been initiated by President Yeltsin 
when he paid a visit to India in January last year. It will get 
a new impetus by the prime minister's forthcoming visit. 
Referring to cooperation in defense matters, Mr. Sen said there 
have been positive developments and the two sides are looking 
for a long-term cooperation in the supply and production of 
defense spares and equipment. 
  Meanwhile, officials in Moscow and New Delhi are giving 
final 
touches to several agreements and a couple of political 
documents to be signed during Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit. The 
prime minister, besides holding one-to-one talk with President 
Yeltsin on bilateral and international issues, will also meet 
many Russian leaders. 
  The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level 
delegation which includes Union Ministers Mr. Pranab Mukherji, 
Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mr. R. L. Bhatia and Mr. Bhvanesh 
Chaturvedi, and defense, finance, and foreign secretaries. Our 
correspondent reports that while trade and commerce will be high 
on the agenda, cooperation in science and technology, atomic 
energy, defense, and tourism will also figure prominently at the 
talks.
