<DESCRIPT>  ELECTION; RESULT; INDIA  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Congress Party, in a leadership quandary after the assassination of former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, prepared today to return to power after capturing
a strong lead in parliamentary elections.;    But partial election returns
indicated the party, which led a vast and impoverished nation to freedom and
democracy a half-century ago, will fall short of a majority and will have to
form a coalition government.  </LEADPARA>

BUT IT WILL NEED TO FORM COALITION; SLAIN
LEADER WINS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Lame-duck Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, his party badly beaten, offered
his resignation today as a prelude to the formation of a new government.;   
The election campaign was the most violent in India's history, claiming at
about 300 lives.;    A combination of voter frustration with other parties'
short-lived governments and sympathy over Gandhi's slaying propelled the
Congress Party into a wide lead over its rivals.;    Gandhi himself was
re-elected posthumously to the parliament. His May 21 assassination by a
suicide bomber came after his rural constituency of Amethi in northern India
had already voted. A by-election will be held later to fill the seat.;   
Nearly a month after his death, party leaders were still wrangling over a
successor even as they prepared to take the reins of government.;    "Sure, we
are going to form the government," said Congress Party General Secretary
Balram Jakhar. He said the party was ready to seek a coalition with almost any
party except its strongest challenger, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata
Party.;    The Bharatiya Janata, which campaigned on a platform of Hindu
nationalism, was improving on its performance in previous elections and looked
set to become the main opposition group. But it was routed by Congress in one
state it had swept in the 1989 elections and sank dramatically in a second.;  
 A top Bharatiya Janata leader, Atal Behari Vaypayee, said his party would
play the role of "an effective opposition" in parliament, Press Trust of India
reported.;    The Janata Dal party of V.P. Singh, who succeeded Gandhi as
prime minister in 1989, was the big loser. Singh won in his own constituency,
but his party's already-diminished power base was reduced to little more than
two of India's 25 states.;    With nearly two-thirds of the races declared,
there were only two seats for the splinter party of Chandra Shekhar, who
replaced Singh last November.;    Chandra Shekhar, leader of the Socialist
Janata Dal, met with President Ramaswamy Venkataraman and asked to be relieved
of the prime ministership as soon as possible, Press Trust said.;    With 320
of the 511 Parliament seats declared, the Congress Party had won 168, the
Bharatiya Janata 73 and the Janata Dal 24, state-run television reported. The
rest went to smaller parties, including 12 to regional parties allied with the
Congress.;    Election analyst Prannoy Roy said in a television commentary
that the results, coupled with trends in undeclared races, indicated the
Congress Party would end up with 210 to 220 seats.;    Turnout was 53 percent,
the lowest in any of India's nine previous parliamentary elections, according
to preliminary figures.;    After Gandhi's assassination, the Congress Party
was cast into disarray when his Italian-born widow, Sonia, declined to assume
her husband's role as party president and the post went to former Foreign
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.;    Rao, 69, was a compromise candidate whose
selection avoided a potentially divisive power struggle. But Rao, an
uninspired campaigner with no personal power base, was not even a candidate in
the parliamentary elections.  </TEXT>
