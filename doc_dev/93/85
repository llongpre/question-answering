<F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio special correspondent Bhupal </F>
Inder Saini] 
  [Text] The prime minister is today launching upon two days 
of intensive interaction with decision makers in the United 
States -- both in the political and economic spheres. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao will first of all address the joint meeting of 
both houses of the U.S. Congress today. He will be the first 
prime minister of any country to get the opportunity since Mr. 
Clinton took over as U.S. president. Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
expected to utilize it to spell out India's views on the 
emerging world scenario -- both in the political and economic 
fields as well as regional and bilateral issues. 
  Significantly, the prime minister's address to the Congress 
became possible after several American senators as well members 
of the House of Representatives expressed their wish to hear in 
person the prime minister of the largest democracy in the world. 
It was not on the original schedule earlier. Mr. Narasimha Rao 
will have his first meeting with President Clinton tomorrow, 
when they have talks at the White House. After having lunch 
together, the two leaders will address a joint news conference. 
An atmosphere conducive to an open and frank Indo-U.S. dialogue 
has been created with both sides making clear their views on 
major world and regional issues. There is a large area of 
agreement though there are differences in perspective on some 
issues. Both sides recognized that there is need to make the 
world a secure place free from a threat of major conflagration. 
There is need for disarmament, especially in the nuclear field. 
  India has made it clear that it is prepared to discuss the 
question of disarmament, including nuclear nonproliferation, but 
real world security can be established in a comprehensive 
nondiscriminatory framework only. The Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty -- NPT -- is unacceptable to India in its present form as 
it is discriminatory and seeks to divide the world permanently 
into two categories -- the nuclear haves and havenots. The 
Clinton Administration, which was earlier pressing for a 
regional NPT for South Asia has now shown understanding of 
India's viewpoint that such an arrangement cannot work. Nuclear 
weapons cannot be banished from the region just by two countries 
signing the NPT or a regional variation. 
  Another major focus of Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit is on 
strengthening Indo-American business ties. A large number of 
top Indian industrialists and business people are now in 
Washington having talks with their American counterparts on 
joint ventures and tie-ups. The finance minister, Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, is also in the American capital to clear any doubts about 
the far-reaching character of India's economic reforms. The 
United States is already India's largest trading partner. But a 
full potential for greater economic cooperation is yet to be 
tapped. Hopefully, the interaction during Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
visit will lead to increased trade and economic cooperation.
