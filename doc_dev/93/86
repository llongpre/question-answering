  [Text] New Delhi, March 19 (AFP) -- Calls for recognition 
of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile and support for the 
Tibetan freedom struggle resounded at a global parliamentary 
conference on Tibet here Saturday. 
  Delegate after delegate voiced support for the cause of 
Tibetan independence from Chinese rule on the second day of the 
three-day convention, under way at a venue on the outskirts of 
the Indian capital. 
  Lord Ennais, a former British minister for home and overseas 
development and a member of the all-party parliamentary group 
for Tibet in Britain, urged the international community to 
extend recognition to the exile government. 
  He also called upon world governments to use their influence 
in the United Nations to help the Tibetan cause and end what he 
called the "last vestiges of colonialism." 
  It was the main theme of Saturday's proceedings at the 
conference, being attended by nearly 40 MPs from 23 countries 
and an equal number of Indian deputies. 
  Gonzalo Facio, a former foreign minister of Costa Rica and 
his country's ambassador to the United States, supported the 
call for recognition of the government-in-exile, based in the 
northern Indian town of Dharamsala. 
  "Such a recognition by governments will not immediately lead 
to the freedom of the Tibetan people but it will help them 
achieve the objective," said Facio. 
  "I am all in favour of it. I think governments will start 
doing it," he said. 
  The Dalai Lama, supreme spiritual leader of six million 
Tibetans, has lived in exile in India since fleeing his homeland 
in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule. 
  His government-in-exile is presently recognised by no 
country. His host India, which is home to some 100,000 of his 
followers, also treats Tibet as a part of China. 
  But the sentiments expressed at the parliamentary conference 
reflected the growing world support for recognition of the exile 
government, said Tashi Wangdi, a Tibetan leader. 
  Delegates also said complete independence was the only 
solution to the Tibetan issue. 
  "The root of all problems (in Tibet) is the Chinese colonial 
rule in Tibet," said Norwegian MP Harald Ellefsen. "Bringing an 
end to that colonial rule will be the only fair and just 
solution." 
  Latvian representative Jurif Sinka said: "I hope China will 
find the courage, humility and generosity .. and set the Tibetan 
people free." 
  Polish delegate Henryk Wujec urged the Tibetans to struggle 
like the Polish Solidarity group had done against the Communist 
regime in Warsaw. 
  Leif Bergdahl of Sweden suggested that the convention send a 
delegation to Tibet and compile a report on the situation in the 
Himalayan region, overrun by Chinese troops in 1949. 
  The conference is being held in the shadow of the Dalai 
Lama's warning to China earlier this month that he may be forced 
to bow to hardline elements within the Tibetan movement if China 
does not respond to his moderate approach. 
  Tibetan delegate Karma Chophell said the Tibetans wanted 
nothing less than total freedom. "We are not seeking any 
autonomy. this should be very clear to everyone," he said. 
  Chophell said the Tibetans had realised after 14 years of 
contacts between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities that 
Beijing was only biding time and was not interested in a 
solution. 
  "The final solution for all problems in Tibet is the 
complete 
independence of Tibet," he sad. 
  Deputies on Saturday also broke up into separate groups to 
discuss alleged human rights abuses in Tibet, environmental 
degradation and a perceived threat to Tibetan culture posed by a 
Chinese influx.
