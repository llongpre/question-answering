  [Text] New Delhi, January 1 (XINHUA) -- Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao said today that he would like to see a 
high-level India-China economic and trade cooperation. 
  During his half-hour meeting with visiting Chinese Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi here, Rao said 
bilateral trade between India and China is encouraging and that 
there exists the great potential for further development of 
India-China trade. 
  He said that there is a long way to go in fully tapping the 
trade potential, hoping that both sides will find the ways and 
means to tap it as the time goes. 
  India and China, the two developing countries sharing many 
commonalities, could explore some specific areas for setting up 
joint ventures, Rao suggested. 
  He expressed the hope that there will be more and more 
India- 
China joint ventures in both countries and more and more areas 
will be covered in bilateral cooperation between the two nations. 
  The Chinese minister said that the Governments of China and 
India should encourage direct trade between the two countries to 
push the trade volumes up. 
  She expressed her gratitude to India for India's support to 
China in join the GATT and reiterate that China will continue to 
support India joining the Asia and Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum.
