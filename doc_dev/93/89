  [Text] India has cautioned the United States against 
triggering of an arms race in the subcontinent by supplying 
sophisticated aircraft to Pakistan. The Indian side told the 
U.S. deputy secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, that any 
supply of F-16 aircraft to Islamabad will compel New Delhi to 
take measures in response. This will diversify the much-needed 
resources for the welfare of the people and affect the ongoing 
economic reforms. It was emphatically stated at the talks that 
the U.S. move is of great concern to New Delhi. The Indian side 
said in the public mind there is a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan 
seen as the replay of the cold war attitude. It said that Jammu 
and Kashmir is an integral part of India and territorial 
integrity will not be sacrificed at any cost. On nuclear 
nonproliferation and disarmament, India backs the 1988 action 
plan announced by Rajiv Gandhi which offers several initiatives 
for achieving the goal. On the Washington-backed Pakistan 
proposal for a multilateral fora for nonproliferation, India and 
the U.S. agreed to continue the dialogue on the concept. 
  Mr. Talbott had an hour-long meeting with the prime minister 
today. Mr. Narasimha Rao has accepted in principle President 
Clinton's invitation to visit the United States. The dates of 
the visit will be worked out later by the two sides. 
  Addressing a press conference, Mr. Talbott ruled out supply 
of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, if Islamabad does not agree to a 
verifiable cap on its nuclear weapons program. He said nuclear 
proliferation is a major issue which needs to be addressed 
immediately. He said the U.S. favors expansion of the UN 
Security Council and India being the largest democracy is a 
clear leader to (?claim) a position in the council. 
  Mr. Talbott has since reached Islamabad on a three-day visit 
to Pakistan.
