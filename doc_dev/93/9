  [Text] The prime minister has invited German businessmen 
to invest in India. Addressing the Indo-German Economic 
Conference in Bonn today, Mr. Narasimha Rao described the 
industrial climate in the country as extremely good and 
favorable for investment. Making it clear that his government 
has absolutely no hesitation in going ahead with the economic 
liberalization process, Mr. Rao asserted that India will step up 
the reform process. He assured the German industry that there 
will be no constraints coming in the way. He added that 
constraints if any will be resolved by him and the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. 
  Opening the conference, the chancellor, Dr. Kohl, assured 
India of all possible assistance for the development of the 
industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic 
policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference 
that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of 
Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr. 
Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish 
a high-level India-German commission for science and technology. 
The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N. 
Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on 
technology transfer. 
  Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that 
German 
industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and 
liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been 
forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after 
a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being 
examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our 
correspondent understands that a German festival in India will 
be held as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the 
forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao 
inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force. 
  Here is a report from our special correspondent A. 
Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the 
first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German 
chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step 
towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the 
successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists 
since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of 
view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference 
largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to 
come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global 
interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable 
strategic partner in economic and scientific development because 
of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at 
liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end

  That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn. 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. 
  Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a 
neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured 
prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the 
German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the 
problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is 
deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful 
dialogue.
