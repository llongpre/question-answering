<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Option"] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has done well 
to reiterate India's policy on nuclear proliferation and 
emphasise that, while India is for a universal and comprehensive 
disarmament, suggestions to restrict India's own nuclear options 
are unacceptable and unrealistic in the current world and 
regional context. Given the recent visit of the U.S. deputy 
secretary of state, Mr Strove Talbott, to New Delhi and 
Islamabad in pursuit of America's declared aim of "capping, 
reducing and eventually eliminating" nuclear weapons and 
ballistic missiles in South Asia, it was important for the Prime 
Minister to tell an assembly of army commanders that India's 
policy would not change. Since 1988, this policy has had a 
specific framework in the form of the action plan by the year 
2010 presented by Rajiv Gandhi to the United Nations session on 
disarmament. Under it, the onus for ending the nuclear arms race 
rests squarely on the shoulders of the big powers, and its 
centrepiece is an international treaty to replace the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty], which will see the complete 
elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2010. Things have not 
quite moved the way Rajiv Gandhi anticipated even after the end 
of the cold war and the partial elimination of the fears of a 
nuclear holocaust. Not only have the nuclear weapons states 
remained silent on the subject of the universal elimination of 
nuclear weapons, Britain, France and China have taken no 
concrete steps to join the `big two' in reducing their nuclear 
weapons. 
  On the other hand, countries like India have come under 
pressure to take steps to reassure the world that they will not 
make nuclear weapons, despite India's proven track record of 
responsible behaviour in this area. For this very reason, Mr 
Rao's observations are important. When the subject is nuclear 
proliferation, there is in any case great need for precision, 
especially because India's known position on the issue is one of 
carefully cultivated ambiguity. In this context, Mr Atal Behari 
Vajpayee may not be wrong in pointing out that India's stand on 
nuclear issues is not related to Pakistan alone, but he is 
perhaps reading too much into the Prime Minister's statement as 
reported in the media. A closer reading of the official release 
makes it clear that Mr Rao had in mind a wider context, 
including areas other than Pakistan where such weapons could be 
found. The Prime Minister cannot but be aware of the strong 
feelings that the subject arouses in the country, especially 
since India has chosen the responsible policy of merely 
retaining, but not exercising, the nuclear option. Unlike other 
countries which depend on alliances for their security, India is 
a self-professedly non-aligned country which must ensure its own 
in a world or a region which is not entirely peaceful.
