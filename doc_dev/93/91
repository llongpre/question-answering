  [Text] New Delhi, June 15 (XINHUA) -- A trade delegation 
led by Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation Wu Yi arrived here early this morning to explore the 
ways and means of expanding Sino-Indian bilateral trade. 
  Wu Yi, who is on a three-day visit to India at the 
invitation 
of the Indian Commerce Ministry, will attend the fifth meeting 
of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and Trade Affairs 
which is taking place in a few hours. 
  The two sides "will discuss matters of common interest 
relating to economic, trade and technological cooperation 
between the two countries," she said at the airport. 
  The joint team was set up after late Indian Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi visited China in 1988 to promote bilateral trade 
between the two countries. 
  The two countries will sign the minutes of talks and the 
protocol on trade for 1994-95 at the conclusion of the one-day 
meeting of the joint team. 
  During her stay here, she will meet Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev, 
Minister of State for Coal A. Panja as well as Minister of State 
for Petroleum Captain S. Sharma. 
  Traveling with her is a 11-member team of businessmen from 
Chinese trading corporations dealing with silk, livestock, 
mineral products and metallurgy. 
  The Chinese chief executives will interact directly with 
their Indian counterparts to look for more opportunities of 
business and cooperation. 
  Bilateral trade between India and China totaled 670 million 
U.S. dollars last year with a surplus of 157 million dollars in 
favor of India. China imports large quantities of iron ore, 
steel, hides and skins from India and exports silk to it 
annually.
