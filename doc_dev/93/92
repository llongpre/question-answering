  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--In a significant observation, the 
foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, has said India was willing to 
discuss with Pakistan some compromise to resolve the Kashmir 
issue, reports UNI. 
  Making the comment in an interview with "Asianet" satellite 
channel, the foreign secretary said that during his talks with 
his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shaharyar Khan, in January next 
year, he would have a "limited brief, that is to emphasize to my 
colleagues in Pakistan that we are willing to reason with them 
to find some compromise to this difficult problem." 
  Mr Dixit said unilateral and "absolute claims cannot be the 
basis for solving this problem." 
  "We have to take into account the developments of over 40 
years on both sides of the line of control, in seeing where we 
should go," he added. 
  The foreign secretary noted that "previously we were saying 
that we will not discuss Kashmir at all unless interference and 
support to terrorism was stopped." 
  "We have now been told that they (Pakistan) are willing to 
discuss this aspect. If that is so, we can take the next step 
for dealing with Kashmir directly. 
  Referring to the Clinton administration's decision to 
withdraw the Pressler amendment, Mr Dixit said that Washington 
was pursuing a policy of non-discrimination and pressure to push 
countries towards non-proliferation. 
  The first step would be to withdraw the Pressler amendment 
and then introduce legislation, which will apply to all 
countries about whom they have doubts. 
  He said that in the last 18-19 years "We have constantly 
taken a decision not to make N-weapons." 
  The foreign secretary expressed views on a number of topics 
including India's relations with China, the U.S. and other 
issues. 
  On India's relations with China, Mr Dixit said both sides 
have an equal level of reasonableness in interacting with each 
other. 
  He said then Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi's visit to 
China 
was a landmark. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
visit in September laid firm foundations, which culminated in 
the signing of an agreement to maintain peace and tranquility on 
the line of actual control. 
  The foreign secretary said China is not only a regional 
power, but a global power. He said India should not also 
underestimate the capacity of three continental 
states--Kazakhstan, Russia and Japan.
