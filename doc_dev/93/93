  [Text] New Delhi June 3 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Yuriy Yarov arrived here today at the head of a 
delegation. His visit is aimed at preparing documents to be 
signed during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
official visit to Russia towards the end of June, and 
activization the work of the joint Russian- Indian trade, 
economic, scientific and technical cooperation commission. In 
his capacity as chairman of the Russian part of the commission, 
Yarov will hold working meetings with its co-chairman from the 
Indian side, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee and talks with 
other members of the government of India. 
  "India is among those few states, relations with which have 
never undergone any cardinal changes and are not subject to any 
reassessment as a result of serious political and economic 
changes that took place in our country," Yuriy Yarov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS after his arrival in Delhi. "India has 
always been given top priority in Russia's foreign policy, which 
was emphasised by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to 
members of Indian Parliament during his visit to Delhi," he 
emphasised. 
  Yuriy Yarov had a working meeting with Indian Commerce 
Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the Hyderabad House in Delhi today. 
  In his opening speech, the Indian commerce minister 
emphasised that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India 
in January, 1993 was an important stage in the history of 
Russian-Indian relations. The visit helped resolve many 
important questions, including the payment of India's debt to 
Russia, and helped determine the further path of our cooperation 
in economic, trade and scientific spheres. Mukherjee expressed 
the hope that new avenues of cooperation between Russia and 
India will be opened in trade, economic and scientific spheres 
during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's forthcoming 
visit to Moscow, and as a result of his talks with Russian 
leaders. 
  The chairman of the joint Russian-Indian commission, in 
particular, highly appreciated fruitful and mutually beneficial 
cooperation between Russia and India which is now embracing all 
spheres of economic activities. But due to a number of reasons 
the trade between Russia and India slumped, leading to a 
significant fall in turnover over the past few years, he said. 
  Mukherjee expressed confidence that Russian-Indian trade 
will 
soon be doubled from its current level of 25 billion rupees, and 
cooperation between the two countries will considerably increase 
thanks to economic reforms being carried out in Russia and 
India. The Indian minister recalled that an important role has 
to be played by representativies of Russian and Indian private 
sectors. Their activities will not only help considerably 
increase exports from India to Russia to clear India's debt to 
Russia, but will also help set up joint enterprises for selling 
goods to third countries. 
  The two co-chairmen discussed specific questions about 
expanding trade, activizing economic cooperation and using new 
forms of cooperation between business circles of the two 
countries. Both sides paid special attention to resolve the 
problem of avoiding double taxation in their bilateral trade, 
the question of increasing supplies of goods from India to clear 
its debt to Russia, the introduction of concessional import duty 
on Indian goods and setting up a Russian-Indian bank. 
  Today Yuriy Yarov also held talks with Indian Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh and Minister of State for Steel Santosh 
Mohan Dev. 
  The Russian delegation will fly to Bangalore on Saturday to 
acquaint itself with the work of Indian aeronautics and space 
industry enterprises. Their programme also includes a visit to 
Bombay, the "trade capital of India", where Yuriy Yarov and 
officials accompanying him will see shipyards, and also be 
guests of scientists of the Bhabha atomic research centre.
