   Police on Monday arrested 24 Tibetan
demonstrators who accused the Chinese of killing the Panchen Lama,
the second-ranking leader of Tibetan Buddhism, Press Trust of India
said.
   In Switzerland on Monday, the exiled Dalai Lama, who is spiritual
and temporal leader to the Tibetans, eulogized the Panchen Lama as a
``freedom fighter.''
   His announcement was a surprise. When the Dalai Lama fled Tibet
after a failed uprising in 1959, the Panchen Lama backed the
communists, became their chief spokesman on Sino-Tibetan unity and
was considered a collaborator.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported the 50-year-old
Panchen Lama, who lived in Beijing, died Saturday of a heart attack
in the Tibetan town of Xigaze. He had traveled there to dedicate a
shrine.
   Press Trust of India quoted a spokesman for the arrested Tibetans
as saying the Panchen Lama had no history of heart trouble.
   The spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, claimed Chinese
authorities killed the Panchen Lama ``because he could not be a
puppet.''
   Indian police arrested the Tibetans, who were demonstrating
outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi, and charged them with
breaking the peace.
   At the time of his death, the 10th Panchen Lama was vice chairman
of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, and honorary
president of the Chinese Buddhists' Association.
   He often had denied charges by exiles that Tibetans continue to
be arrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to Chinese rule.
In recent years, however, Tibet's second-highest priest openly
discussed the sufferings of Tibetans since the communist army
occupied the sparsely populated mountain area in 1950.
   ``The Panchen Rinpoche fought for the rights of the Tibetan
people during the most difficult period,'' said a statement from the
Dalai Lama's European headquarters in Zurich. ``He was indeed a
freedom fighter. His sudden demise is a great loss and I am deeply
grieved.''
   He declared three days of mourning to be observed in Dharmsala,
the Indian home-in-exile shared by the Dalai Lama and some of the
100,000 Tibetans who fled with him.
   ``As recently as last week, the Panchen Lama admonished China's
repressive rule in Tibet,'' said the statement. ``He noted that
China's mistakes in Tibet were greater than their successes.''
   It was one of the Panchen Lama's strongest statements and was
quoted by two official Chinese dailies, which reported that he also
said Tibetans have paid too high a price for their development under
the Chinese.
   Recently, the Panchen Lama had echoed the Dalai Lama's calls for
more autonomy for Tibetans.
   Kesang Tseten was born in February 1938 in Qinghai, the province
northeast of Tibet that also has a large Tibetan population. At age
3, he was named by Tibetan religious leaders as one of three
candidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth Panchen
Lama, who died in 1937.
   After several years of wrangling, and championed by the Chinese
communists, Kesang was approved as the 10th Panchen Lama on June 3,
1949.
   Despite his support for the communists, the Chinese jailed the
Panchen Lama for 20 months during the Cultural Revolution and kept
him under house arrest for nine years. He was allowed to return to
Tibet only in 1982.
   It could take several years to determine the 11th Panchen Lama.
