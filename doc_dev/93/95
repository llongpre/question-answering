   The Dalai Lama, addressing more than
10,000 Tibetan exiles on the 31st anniversary of a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, today said Tibetans must maintain the quest
for freedom.
   ``The positive changes that took place in Eastern Europe are a
clear indication that truth and desire for peace cannot remain
suppressed,'' said the Tibetan temporal and spiritual leader,
winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama, revered as a god-king by his followers, fled the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa on March 17, 1959, a week after the start
of the revolt against China. He made his way across the
snow-covered Himalayan mountains to India and eventually to
Dharmsala, which serves as the seat of his government-in-exile.
   ``Being political refugees, we must work towards political
freedom,'' he told the crowd gathered outside the Buddhist Thekchen
Choeling Temple. ``The Tibetans in Tibet have a greater
responsibility for the future of Tibet, especially the youngsters
and even those Tibetan cadres working for the Chinese.''
   After the ceremony at which the Tibetan flag was raised,
thousands of Tibetans and hundreds of foreigners who had traveled
here for the anniversary staged an five-mile march through this
town in the Himalayan foothills of northern India.
   In New Delhi, about 1,000 Tibetans burned a Chinese flag and
chanted their demands for freedom at India Gate, a soaring stone
arch commemmorating Indians who died in military service for their
colonial British rulers.
   Tibet, a rugged and remote enclave high in the Himalayas, was
invaded by Communist Chinese troops in 1950. China maintains Tibet
has traditionally been part of China, but the Dalai Lama and his
followers say Tibet has been independent for centuries.
