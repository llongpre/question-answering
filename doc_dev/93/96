   At least one policeman was killed and 28 injured
in Tibet over the weekend in clashes between police and protesters
demanding Tibet's independence from China, the People's Daily
reported today.
   The newspaper, the voice of the Communist Party, quoted Tibet's
top police official in its report on rioting Saturday in the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   The newspaper did not say how many Tibetans were injured.
Unconfirmed reports from Western sources in Lhasa said three to
nine people were killed, including one Buddhist monk and two
Chinese police officers.
   Western sources contacted in Lhasa said the city was quiet today
and Sunday but that the Jokhang Temple, around which Tibetans
battled police, was closed. The sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said stores were open and marketplace stalls were doing
business today.
   In India, meanwhile, 500 Tibetan refugees, chanting ``We shall
overcome,'' demonstrated in New Delhi today against the Chinese
crackdown in Lhasa.
   Police prevented the demonstrators from going to the Chinese
Embassy. No injuries were reported in sporadic clashes between
protesters and police.
   The demonstration was organized by Tibetan Freedom Movement, an
organization of self-exiled Tibetans, and the Tibetan Youth
Congress.
   India has allowed 120,000 Tibetans and their temporal leader,
the Dalai Lama, to stay in India. The Dalai Lama fled to India in
1959 after an abortive Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.
   The People's Daily today quoted the Tibetan police official,
Public Security Bureau Chief Lang Jie, as saying on Tibetan
television Sunday that the disturbances in Lhasa began when
``separatists'' infiltrated a crowd on the final day of a 10-day
prayer festival. He said they started shouting ``independence for
Tibet'' and other ``counter-revolutionary'' slogans.
   Lang said 20 to 30 Buddhist monks circled the Jokhang Temple,
shouting slogans and throwing stones and damaging Chinese
television vans. The official China News Service earlier gave the
number as 60.
   They also attacked the Tibetan branch of the Buddhist
Association and set fire to a car belonging to the group,
controlled by the Chinese government.
   ``Their purpose was to destroy the peace and unity of our
country and our region and the peaceful and prosperous life of all
nationalities (in Tibet),'' he was quoted as saying. The report did
not say how many Tibetans took part in the riots or if there were
any arrests.
   Saturday was the first outbreak of violence since last Oct. 1,
when 2,000 Tibetans, led by Buddhist monks, set fire to a police
station facing the Jokhang Temple. Police opened fire, and at least
14 people were killed.
   China, which claims Tibet has been an integral part of the
nation for centuries, moved troops into the remote mountain region
in 1950.
   Many Tibetans deeply resent the Beijing government because of
oppression of Tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of
temples during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.
   Although China has tried to redress past wrongs, friction
remains between the Tibetans and the Hans, China's ethnic majority,
which continues to hold many senior posts in Lhasa.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today that rioters
``stormed, looted and set fire to shops and restaurants and beat up
policemen sent to maintain order.''
   It said rioters with steel bars and wooden sticks knocked down
policemen Yuan Shisheng and Yang Yuchen, stabbed them and threw
them from a second-floor window. Yuan, a 22-year-old Tibetan, died
later in a hospital and Yang was reported in serious condition.
   The Western sources said Tibetans set fire to vehicles and lit
bonfires over a 12-hour period, and that police fired tear gas
during the day to control the violence. Gunshots were heard after
dark, they said.
   The Lhasa government has turned down almost all requests by
foreign journalists to visit Lhasa and has restricted tourism to
the area since the disturbances last October.
