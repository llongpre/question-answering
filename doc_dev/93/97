<LEADPARA>  Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao told India on Saturday that it faced a
serious economic crisis that could only be resolved by hard decisions, new
foreign investment and an end to the inefficiency that cripples the country's
growth.;    In his first speech as prime minister, Rao struck a pro-Western,
pro-investment, open-market note -- a marked change from the policies and
language that have stamped the dominant Congress Party for decades.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     West approves;  A senior Western diplomat said Rao's comments on the
economy "sounded very good to us." They were plainly an attempt to assure
Western lending institutions like the International Monetary Fund that India
was serious in its willingness to make tough financial sacrifices.;   
Congress Party officials said Rao sought to mirror economic pledges made by
the late Rajiv Gandhi during the election campaign. The May 21 assassination
of Gandhi delayed the elections that finally ended last week with a Congress
Party plurality.;    Rao, a former foreign minister and Congress Party elder,
spoke quietly and firmly in English on Saturday. His remarks dealt with his
first priority, the economic crisis in this nation of 850 million.;    Partly
because it has had four different governments with four finance ministers over
the last two years, partly because of the spiraling deficit and prices, and
partly because of immense public spending, India is facing its worst economic
situation in decades.;    Reserves of foreign exchange are running low, and
India is expected to enter negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
for loans that will help tide the nation over.;    Political hot potato;  This
matter is highly political because the fund is expected to seek tough
sacrifices as well as signs that the new government is prepared to reform and
open up its economy.;    For a government without a strong popular mandate,
taking such steps is delicate. And India has been loath to acknowledge that it
needs Western support and would shift its economic and investment policies to
gain such assistance.  </TEXT>
