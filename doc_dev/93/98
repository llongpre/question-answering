   The Dalai Lama, exiled leader of the
Tibetan people, today recognized China's right to handle Tibet's
foreign affairs and maintain troops on Tibetan soil.
   The Dalai Lama proposed talks with China to make Tibet ``a
self-governing, democratic political entity ... in association with
the People's Republic of China (which) could remain responsible for
Tibet's foreign policy.''
   ``Until such a peace conference can be convened and
demilitarization and neutralization achieved, China could have the
right to maintain a restricted number of military installations in
Tibet,'' he said.
   His remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery to the
European Parliament. The speech subsequently was canceled because
of fears his appearance would offend the Chinese government, and
the Buddhist spiritual leader spoke with reporters after copies of
his speech were distributed.
   The Dalai Lama previously has made little mention of Chinese
interests in Tibet. He also neither accepted the Chinese military
presence in the remote territory nor recognized China's right to
handle its foreign affairs.
   In today's speech, he spoke both of ``accommodating China's own
interests'' in Tibet while re-establishing ``Tibet's separate
identity.''
   He also said the ``government of the People's Republic of China
could remain responsible for Tibet's foreign policy'' and that
``China could have the right to maintain a restricted number of
military installations in Tibet.''
   But he said the ultimate goal is a demilitarized Tibet, ``a
genuine sanctuary of peace.''
   China regards Tibet as a critical buffer zone between itself and
India, a traditional rival. Western estimates put the number of
Chinese soldiers in Tibet at tens of thousands.
   The Dalai Lama said he was ``well aware that many Tibetans will
be disappointed by the moderate stand'' these new ideas represent.
   But, he argued that such conciliation represents the ``most
realistic means'' for restoring ``the fundamental rights of the
Tibetan people.''
   China claims Tibet has been part of its empire for more than six
centuries. Tibetan activists say Tibet is an independent country
and point to its separate language, culture and traditions as proof.
   Communist troops entered Tibet after defeating Nationalist
Chinese forces in 1949.
   Ten years later, Tibetan activists rebelled against Chinese
rule. The Chinese army crushed the uprising and the Dalai Lama fled
to India with thousands of other Tibetans.
   During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, bands of Chinese
radicals, called Red Guards, destroyed most of Tibet's Buddhist
temples and killed monks.
   After the fall of the ultra-leftist Gang of Four, conditions in
Tibet improved and the state began putting more money into the
region.
   But the improved conditions also led to increased expectations
by the Tibetan people.
   Tibet has been rocked by two major anti-Chinese protests _ both
in Lhasa, the capital. The protests, which occurred last fall and
again in March, left dozens of Tibetans and Chinese dead.
   Hundreds of Tibetan monks who led the rebellion were reportedly
arrested.
   The Dalai Lama was to speak to the European Parliament, but the
invitation was withdrawn. He had been invited by Lady Elles, a
British Conservative.
   Lord Plumb, the parliament president, said he did ``not believe
that the Dalai Lama's visit is helpful in the current circumstances
of the European Parliament's improving relations with China.''
   Sources said Plumb, who is to visit China in July, feared a
formal speech to the parliament by the Dalai Lama would jeopardize
Plumb's visit to China.
   In October, the parliament urged China to respect Tibet's right
to self-determination and invited the Dalai Lama to address the
518-member parliament. Beijing then canceled a visit to China this
year by a parliamentary delegation.
   The Dalai Lama is in the middle of a 16-day tour of Europe. On
Tuesday, he met with Pope John Paul II.
