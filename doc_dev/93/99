<HEAD>Chinese President Accuses Dalai Lama Of Trying To Split Nation</HEAD>

   President Li Xiannian on Saturday accused the
Dalai Lama, exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, of trying
to undermine the national unity of China.
   ``We have respect for the Dalai Lama, but he does not respect
China, his motherland,'' Li told a delegation from the Nepalese
parliament. ``He is actually trying to split the country up.''
   Li's remarks, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, were
among the first by a senior Chinese official criticizing the Dalai
Lama following bloody anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa on March 5.
   The Xinhua report did not say whether Li directly linked the
Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, to the riots.
China blamed followers of the Dalai Lama for instigating similar
pro-independence disturbances in Lhasa last September and October.
   Li told the Nepalese visitors that the principle of unity rather
than ``crude tactics'' must be used to settle problems concerning
religion or nationality.
   ``The crude and leftist policies formulated during the Cultural
Revolution have long since been corrected. The central authorities
have adopted a policy of unity and mutual help. Another important
principle is that the more than 50 nationalities in China should be
united,'' he said.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, leftists destroyed
Tibetan temples and suppressed the languages and customs of
Tibetans and other minority groups. Although Beijing has tried to
make amends by restoring temples and promoting local autonomy,
resentment against the Chinese remains strong.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India with about 100,000 followers after
an unsuccessful uprising against Chinese troops in 1959. He is
still widely revered in Tibet.
   China says one policeman was killed during the March 5 riots,
which were led by monks shouting slogans in support of the Dalai
Lama and independence. Unconfirmed reports from Western travelers
in Lhasa have put the death toll much higher, with one traveler
quoting Tibetans as saying 21 Tibetans and three police died in the
clash.
   There have also been widespread reports of mass arrests, but
China's official media have given no figures.
   The Dalai Lama, following the March 5 disturbances, issued a
statement praising the courage of Tibetans who stood up to Chinese
rule and said that ``even in the face of mounting Tibetan
resentment the Chinese leadership still fails to understand the
true aspirations of the Tibetan people.''
   He also appealed to Tibetans to restrain from violence.
   Li thanked the Nepalese delegation for making it possible for
10,000 Tibetans to live in Nepal, and Nepalese parliament Chairman
Navraj Subedi said the Nepalese government will never allow those
Tibetans to do anything harmful to China, Xinhua reported.
