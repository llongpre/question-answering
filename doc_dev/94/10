   Klaus K. Obermeier used to compute only in his
office. Now that he has a laptop computer, he computes in the back
seat of the car, on the plane, beside the pool and even, he admits,
in bed.
   Obermeier, who works for Battelle Memorial Institute in
Columbus, Ohio, is the kind of person who is making laptop models
into one of the hottest segments of the computer business.
   Until recently, laptop computers tended to be underpowered and
overpriced, with small, poorly lit screens and batteries that ran
out at inconvenient times.
   Those problems have not been conquered completely, but enough
progress has been made to release a flood of pent-up demand among
business people, students, writers and others.
   Sales of laptop computers will surpass $1 billion in the United
States this year and are growing at a rate of 40 percent annually,
according to Dataquest Inc., a market researcher.
   This fall, in some ways, marks the coming of age of laptop
computers.
   This week, on Monday and Tuesday, Japan's Toshiba Corp. and NEC
Corp. are expected to unveil new models for the laptop market, an
industry segment where they have enjoyed some of their greatest
success in the United States.
   Compaq Computer Corp., which disdained the market until now, is
expected to introduce its first laptop model at an Oct. 17 press
conference in New York. The Houston-based company says only that it
will announce a ``new dimension'' in personal computing.
   Finally, analysts say International Business Machines Corp. will
come out soon with a successor to its 2-year-old PC Convertible, a
relatively slow machine that has been criticized by computer buffs.
IBM spokesman Scott Brooks confirmed that a new laptop is planned
but would not say when it would be available.
   As a sign of the market's importance, Zenith Electronics Corp.,
which dominates the government market for laptops, has even managed
to make the machines the linchpin of its entire data systems
business.
   ``The laptop market is one that is coming into its own after
many years of really being a niche market,'' said Margaret
Rodenberg, vice president of marketing for Entre Computer Centers
Inc., a retail chain.
   Laptop computers have always gotten good press, perhaps because
journalists were some of their earliest users. Tandy Corp.'s Radio
Shack TRS 80 Model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the
campaign trail _ the ``Trash 80.''
   But people who needed more computing power shied away from them.
John Vanden Brink, a consultant in Des Plaines, Ill., said he once
destroyed an entire database when he tried to transfer something
out of his Radio Shack and exceeded the memory limit.
   The newest models, in contrast, are loaded with power. Toshiba
and NEC are both announcing models this week that use Intel Corp.'s
top-of-the-line 80386 microprocessor, PC Week newspaper says.
   The problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for
electricity and drain batteries quickly. Seizing an opportunity,
Chips and Technologies Inc. of San Jose, Calif., recently
introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of
time that many laptops can run on batteries.
   Prices for laptops are relatively high _ $2,000 to $10,000 _
because of the expense of the batteries, energy-saving CMOS memory
chips and the complex technology of flat screens.
   The flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell
and usually display 25 lines at a time, in comparison to the 40
lines of a regular personal computer. Brightness and contrast,
although much improved, still don't match those of full-sized PCs.
   Once on the road, laptop owners have abundant headaches: No
place to recharge batteries, no modular phone jacks, hotel phone
switches that can't handle data transmissions, 3{-inch disks that
aren't compatible with other people's 5\-inch disks.
   Still, something keeps laptop users tapping away.
   Laptops, like cellular phones, allow people to keep working
while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the in-flight
magazine. They also encourage spontaneity by letting people record
or try out ideas while they are fresh.
   ``I would say there's like a 150 to 200 percent improvement in
my productivity. I can't even think with a paper and pencil
anymore,'' said Jeffrey Greene, a laptop enthusiast who works in
the Philadelphia office of Hay Group Inc., a Washington-based
personnel consulting firm.
   Of course, working through the night on a laptop on a long
flight can be bad for one's public image, said Jerry Whitcomb, a
consultant at Atlanta-based Management Science America Inc.
   ``People think you're a workaholic,'' Whitcomb said.
   Whitcomb, nonetheless, is a confirmed laptop user. He even uses
it in the office: ``It does everything a regular PC does so I don't
need to have both,'' he said.
