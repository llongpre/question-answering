HOME USED FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN PROPOSED AS HISTORIC MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Los Angeles city Cultural Heritage Commission recommended Wednesday that an 
83-year-old Craftsman-style home in Highland Park be declared a 
historic-cultural monument, alleviating concern over its future. 
</P>
<P>
The concern arose when a program for abused children that operated out of the 
home closed last year after 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The home, built with river-bed boulders, was designed by Los Angeles architect 
Robert Edmund Williams. It includes a stained-glass window by the Judson 
Studios of Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, the estate had been operated by the Hathaway Home for Children, a 
program for abused and neglected children run by Hathaway Children's Services, 
a private, nonprofit child welfare agency that also owns the property. In 
September, the agency closed the home and transferred the remaining youths, 
ages 6 to 13, to its headquarters in Little Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended that only the house be designated a 
historic-cultural monument, excluding 2 acres of grounds and dorms. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cahill, Hathaway Children's Services president, said the agency intends 
to keep the home for use as a community service center. He said the agency's 
board is considering selling the balance of the 2.8-acre site for development 
of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation requires approval of the City Council. If the 
council grants the historic-cultural status, any proposed changes to the site 
would require approval by the commission.
