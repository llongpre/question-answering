   Innovations expected to propel the manufacturing
industry into the future, including video headsets and floating
concrete, are on display at the National Design Engineering Show
and Conference.
   About 25,000 engineers are expected to converge on Chicago's
lakefront McCormick Place through Thursday to see new designs from
companies such as Dow Chemical Co. and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Co. _ even NASA.
   Many of the products and materials on display represent minor
advances _ a fiber that resists fading just a bit longer, for
example. Nevertheless, consumers will feel the effect of the new
technology.
   ``You and I, ultimately, in some way will be related or involved
with every single product in this show, whether it's paint on an
automobile or the spring in the seat or the knobs to turn on your
hi-fi,'' said Robert Rosaler, director of an engineering conference
sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
conjunction with the show.
   Some new products debuting at the show take a broader step into
the future.
   For example, a Massachusetts company is showing a miniature
video display monitor slightly larger than a lipstick. Through the
use of a magnifying lens, the one-inch display window produces an
image that looks as though it is on a 12-inch screen.
   ``This is basically the walkman of the future. It's a
videoman,'' said Raymond Hoffer, a representative of Reflection
Technology of Waltham, Mass.
   By Christmas, the mini video monitor is due to appear in stores
as a component in a 5-by-2 inch paperless pocket fax machine, said
Neil Golden, director of sales for Reflection Technology.
   The 2-ounce terminal can display 25 lines of 80 characters each
on a red-and-black screen. It can attach to a headband that
positions the video screen a few inches in front of the eyes,
allowing a person to look up information while leaving the hands
free to work.
   At least eight other companies plan to use Reflection
Technology's monitor in products including a 5-by-3 portable
computer and a patient monitor that doctors can wear in the
operating room, Golden said.
   NASA is at the show ``to make the U.S. engineering and
scientific community aware that there is NASA technology available
that they may use,'' said Walter Heiland, manager of the agency's
Technology Utilization Office.
   The space agency has a history of spinning off its technological
advances.
   For example, NASA's need in the 1960s for a tool that Apollo
astronauts could use to scoop up moon rocks, resulted in hand-held
cordless vacuum cleaners that eventually reached consumers. More
recently, a version of a pump developed for the Viking Mars lander
has been implanted in people to deliver medicine such as insulin.
   3M is showcasing a lightweight concrete subsitute called
Macrolite that weighs about a third as much as the real thing.
   To illustrate, 3M representatives filled a tub with water and
put in two ``concrete'' logs. One sinks. The other, made of the
substitute, floats.
   Developed by 3M in 1986, the lightweight concrete can be used
for building in earthquake-prone areas.
   ``You can build the same high-rise buildings, only much lighter,
so when they sway they don't topple over,'' said William Whitcomb,
a company representative.
   3M says the ceramic substance, pumped with air, is a better
insulator than concrete. An 8-inch wall of Macrolite provides the
insulating power of 65 inches of concrete, Whitcomb said.
   Dow Plastics, a division of Midland, Mich.-based Dow, is on hand
with a product it has no intention of producing _ a plastic,
elliptical lawnmower that cuts a swath about a foot wider than
traditional push mowers.
   Plastic allows a bigger machine that is no tougher to push than
steel and aluminum models, said mower designer Robert Cleereman.
   The idea is to show commercial engineers that plastics _
particularly Dow plastics _ can be used in place of metals and
woods, said Cleereman, who also is director of Dow's Materials
Engineering Center.
   ``Here's an example where plastics not only do it as well, they
do it better,'' he said.
