<LEADPARA>  If ever you doubted that civilization is going straight into the tank, wonder
no more.;    The decline of America, and everything good about it, can pretty
much be traced by the proliferation of telephones. Not just the number, of
course, but where they're ending up.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     No doubt you've read, or more likely somebody has called to tell you, that
the Giants and A's now offer at-your-seat telephone service during weekday
baseball games.;    "It's sort of a far-out idea still for some people," says
Lorreta Whitcomb, who speaks for Cellular One, a key instigator in the
scheme.;    For others, it's sort of a pain in the butt.;    Like Giants
fanatic Ellen Chandler of Santa Clara, who arrived at Candlestick Park
recently with her headset radio, binoculars, score card, hat decorated with
Croix de Candlestick pins and the full expectation of reveling in the ecstasy
of day baseball on a day when ordinarily she would be at work.;    Uh-uh. In
the bottom of the second, with Matt Williams at bat, Cellular One came calling
for Ellen Chandler. She had a call from St. Louis. As she was trying to figure
out what was going on and how to work her way from her seat in the middle of
the row to the aisle and the cellular telephone, Williams lofted one over the
left field fence. Home run.;    Did she see it?;    "Yeah," she lied. "Well, I
didn't see where the ball landed.";    Seems a friend -- or by now a former
friend -- knew where Chandler was sitting and had set up a three-way
conference call among old chums. In short, the technology had fallen into the
wrong hands.;     "He's Mr. Telephone," Chandler said. "He's always calling
from his car.";    Face it, telephones do not belong in cars, on planes or on
trains. You should not carry them in your pocket, and anyone who brings one to
the golf course should be shot.;    They certainly do not belong in the
bathroom, where they are turning up with disturbing regularity. What call
could be important enough to interrupt Nature's own, with the possible
exception of an emergency ring for toilet paper. Even then, whom are you going
to call and what exactly are you going to say?;    For years we survived quite
nicely with a phone at home, one at work and a pay phone here and there. But
now, that's just not good enough.;    "It's EASY &amp; FREE," the publicity pieces
sent to baseball fans trumpet. "You can return calls FREE from your seat with
mobile phones brought to you by CELLULAR ONE.";    First the wave, then dot
racing, now this.;     If you're just too important to break away -- or even
if you just think you are -- here's how this deal works. First, give your
boss, partners, clients, bookie or probation officer the special number that
will put them through to helpful cellular people at Candlestick or the
Coliseum. Then give the same helpful celluloids your seat number.;    When
that vital call comes, a Cellular Oner will rush over with the message and a
space-age phone that will let you call the all-important person back.;   
"It's the greatest thing in the world," insists Whitcomb, "to be interrupted
at the game to hear that you just saved $20,000 or you just made $20,000.";   
Good news to be sure, but can't it wait? What are you going to do? Run up and
buy 8,000 bags of peanuts and 3,000 or so beers with your new-found wealth?;  
 Of course not. You could never carry all that.;    The simple solution: Don't
conduct business at the ballpark. Just don't. Anyone caught doing so should be
tossed immediately. Give those seats to someone who wants to watch batting
practice, debate the infield fly rule, chomp on peanuts or quaff a beer.;   
Go to the ballpark to get away from business. Sneak out of work. Get sick. Go
see a mysterious client in The City. At most, slide over to the pay phone
before the first pitch, beer firmly in hand. Tell your boss you've run into a
couple of "bottlenecks" that will keep you out the rest of the day.;    It's
an old one, but a good one. Now, excuse me, I've got a call to make.  </TEXT>
