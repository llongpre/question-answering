In New York in the early 1960s dance experiment was centred on Judson
Church. There the earnest and the eager set about forging a new dance -
post-modern, post-Cunningham - which sought a radical re-shaping of
everything that 'dance' had meant up to then.
It was, I suppose, symptomatic of its time, and marked by a Puritanism that
accorded well with current theatrical and musical austerities. One of
Judson's formative figures was Yvonne Rainer, who declared 'No to spectacle;
No to virtuosity; No to transformations and magic and make-believe . . .' (I
saw a Rainer performance, which was crucifyingly boring, and offered no
substitute for anything at all - least of all dance). An ideal had been
stated for many who followed in her unlovely footsteps.
This year Lucinda Childs, one of the most acclaimed Judson graduates, is
making a first British visit with her company. Sophie Constanti reported
here on her Edinburgh Festival debut; on Tuesday night, as the Dance
Umbrella season got under way, Miss Childs and her troupe came to the South
Bank - a glum and not inapt location. The Childs manner offers small cells
of activity which repeat and repeat, re-align and slowly mutate - it is no
accident that she uses minimalist scores as accompaniment - so that the
viewer is made aware of a cumulative structure.
This building-blocks approach to dance would be more fascinating - as the
Shades entry in Bayadere is fascinating in its repetitions and augmentation
 -were the blocks themselves of interest. But to pile up banalities, to
shift their direction, to pass them among a cast like so many tiny
austerities, is not so much architecture as parsimony.
The major piece in Tuesday's programme was Available Light, almost an hour
of routines set below and on a bridge-structure. First made as a museum
installation in Los Angeles a decade ago, it has a score by John Adams which
is vastly more enterprising in the working out of its patterns than Childs'
movement sequences. Ten dancers (looking like sci-fi laboratory assistants
in overalls that reveal pallid inner legs and arms) tread and re-tread their
well-worn paths. Virtuosity is Rainer-ishly denied - the cast look
unstretched - and the development of these ideas is simple-minded. ('Those
two have just turned and run. That means that the other two in black, and
then the four in red, will do the same' - and they do). Miss Childs
manifests herself twice, Cunningham-fashion, but even in these unambitious
technical surroundings, her performance has a constrained air.
The second piece, Concerto, dates from last year and uses Gorecki's
harpsichord concerto. It lasts nine minutes, and its dancers, in smart black
shirts and trousers, nip along pre-destined tracks with something like
vivacity. (The trams are moving faster). Here Childs' style matches the
motor energy of the score in recurring patterns of action, if not in
emotional density. The piece is short enough for the message to seem
intriguing without turning into an acreage of tape-loop repeats. Brevity is
not the soul of post-modernism - but it is a tremendous bonus here.
Lucinda Childs is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until October 20.
