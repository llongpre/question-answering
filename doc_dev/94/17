   NEW YORK -- A small human services agency that pairs
disabled foster children with welfare families was the first
group to receive a new award for Nonprofit Innovation from
Peter F. Drucker, one of America's most prominent management
gurus.
   Judson Center, Royal Oak, Mich., won the $25,000 prize for
boosting the independence and self-sufficiency of
participants in its "Living in Family Environments" program.
Judson moves developmentally disabled foster children out of
hospitals and other institutions; families receive salaries
and training to care for the children, trading their public
support for earned income.

   "This group has a very clear focus and the results are
startling," Mr. Drucker said.
   Some 809 nonprofit groups applied for the award,
administered by a nonprofit foundation and research center
that Mr. Drucker started last year. He said he established
the annual award because many nonprofit organizations,
particularly small ones, "aren't recognized and encouraged"
enough for their social contributions and management
strategies.
   Four nonprofit organizations received honorable mentions
in the contest: Gleaners Community Food Bank, Detroit;
Connecticut Association for Human Services, Hartford, Conn.;
Intercultural Development Research Association, San Antonio,
Texas; and Regis University, Denver.
