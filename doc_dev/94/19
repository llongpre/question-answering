from that post Oct. 1 after turning 65 this month.

   Since joining Parsons in 1970, Mr. Langford has held
various operational and administrative posts. In 1985, he
oversaw the purchase of the company from public stockholders
by Parsons' employee stock ownership plan. He was named
executive vice president and a director in 1989.
   Mr. Langford holds bachelor of science and master's
degrees in business administration from the University of
California at Berkeley. His successor as executive vice
president and chief financial officer will be named soon,
Parsons said. Parsons also has an executive vice president of
business development.
   After his retirement, Mr. Judson will become a special
assistant to Leonard J. Pieroni, Parsons' 52-year-old
chairman and chief executive officer. Parsons said it had
1990 revenue of about $1 billion.
