Edison High School freshman Shelley Taylor learned a quick lesson about the 
quality of competition found at the State track and field championships Friday 
night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Her teacher? Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Running in a preliminary heat of the girls' 1,600 meters, Jorgensen, the 
two-time defending State champion at 1,600 meters and a two-time national 
champion in cross-country, cruised to an easy victory in 4 minutes 55.44 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes who won their heat, plus the next five fastest overall, qualified for 
tonight's finals, beginning at Cerritos College at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who despite being in her first year of competitive running had not lost 
a 1,600-meter race since mid-April, could only watch as Jorgensen loped away at 
the start for a commanding lead. Taylor started out in mid-pack and eventually 
made her way to second, where she finished in 4:58.77, a half-second personal 
improvement and good enough to qualify for tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's improvement, her fourth in as many races, didn't seem to satisfy her, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel great in the race," she said. "I guess I put a lot of pressure 
on myself (to win). I think I expect too much out of myself sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor wasn't impressed with her finish, Jorgensen certainly was. Said 
Jorgensen: "She's not depressed is she? She should be proud of herself, 
especially making it this far as a freshman. I never made it to State finals as 
a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 1,600, Mater Dei's Mike Nielsen advanced with a third-place finish 
in his heat in 4:15.05, the fifth-fastest time overall. Nielsen, who last year 
did not advance past the Southern Section preliminaries, started out in 
mid-pack, then gradually worked his way into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With 200 meters to go, Nielsen, trying to maintain his crisp, efficient stride, 
charged to third and then tried to catch Burbank's Todd Lewis and Arroyo 
Grande's Louie Quintana but could not. Lewis won in 4:12.66, and Quintana was 
second in 4:13.00. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," Nielsen said. "I think I have a lot left. They went by me 
and beat me fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle finished a surprising and disappointing eighth 
in his 1,600 heat and did not advance. Lavelle, who has a best time -- and 
county-leading time -- of 4:11.95, came through the first 300 meters fourth 
from last but worked his way into what appeared to be a comfortable third. 
</P>
<P>
But with 200 meters to go, Lavelle faded and, without a kick, dropped to 
eighth. After the race, he walked off the track with a noticeable limp, his 
left shin bleeding from spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing finish in the long jump, Canyon's Allison Franke 
qualified in her specialty, the discus, with a toss of 151-feet-10, fourth best 
overall. Franke, who fouled twice in the long jump before leaping 17-7, made up 
for the disappointment with an discus series of 151-5, 151-10 and 150-8. 
Bakersfield's Melisa Weis leads the field at 163-9, her first and only throw of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' shotput, Irvine's Bev Oden advanced with a mark of 40-9, 
eighth-best overall. Edison's Leslee Briggs, the county's season leader at 
41-11 1/2, fouled on two of her three attempts. Her only legal mark was 39-8, 
which tied her for tenth. Only 2 3/4 inches separated Briggs from advancing to 
tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' high jump, El Dorado's Lori Svoboda advanced with a leap of 5-6. 
That mark tied her for first with defending state champion Crissy Mills of 
North Hollywood Campbell Hall. Svoboda, who defeated Mills last Friday to win 
the Masters title, passed on the first three heights, cleared 5-4 on her first 
attempt, passed at 5-5 and cleared 5-6 again on her first try. Mills duplicated 
Svoboda's series exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Other county athletes who advanced to tonight's finals were Edison's Doug 
Nichols (sixth-best 800 at 1:54.11); Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Mulhaupt 
(fifth-best 800 at 2:15.38); Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith (fourth-best 
triple jump at 49-7 3/4); Westminster's Shelly Tochluk (the final 400 qualifier 
at 56.34); Valencia's Eric Whitcomb, and Irvine's Sean Rogan (both 14-4 in the 
pole vault); Edison's Greg Thurston (56-3 3/4 shotput) and Edison's boys' 
1,600-meter relay team (3:19.84).
