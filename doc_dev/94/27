The Los Angeles City Council has voted to declare the 94-year old Albert H. 
Judson estate in Highland Park a historic-cultural monument, curtailing 
demolition efforts by its owner, a wealthy real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
The historic monument designation prevents owner Donna Harnsberger from 
demolishing or altering the 15-room mansion for a year. After that, Harnsberger 
can apply for a demolition permit, but the permit would have to be issued by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen as a victory by preservationists. They lobbied hard for 
monument status after Harnsberger surprised them by announcing at a Christmas 
party last year that she intended to tear down the house to build three 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger's decision was seen as ironic by the preservationists. They watched 
in helpless dismay as the longtime Highland Park resident, who has been active 
in battles to save several historic homes in the area, removed molding from 
around doors and windows and uprooted two old palm trees on the estate's 
extensive, overgrown grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The estate, at 4911 Pasadena Avenue Terrace, was once the home of Judson, an 
attorney who in the 1880s subdivided and named Highland Park. The home was 
designed in 1895 by George Wyman, the architect who designed the historic 
Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has vowed to do everything in her power to tear down the house. She 
says that she doesn't believe that the house is historic and that she did weeks 
of research and compiled hundreds of documents to prove it. But when she 
brought her work to a Cultural Affairs Commission meeting earlier this month, 
commissioners said her research only bolstered the preservationists' case. 
</P>
<P>
Harnsberger has not returned repeated phone calls since the council vote. It is 
unclear whether she will seek a permit to demolish the house or eventually seek 
to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like her to restore the house," said Charles Fisher of the Highland 
Park Heritage Trust. "She lived there for years, and she has said she loved it. 
If she doesn't want to restore it, we want her to sell it to someone who will."
