reports on how industrial auction houses have benefited from the recession

WHILE Mr John Major, the prime minister, was saying last week that the
economy was showing the first signs of recovery, industrial auctioneers were
praying quietly that the bad times were here to stay.
Mr Brian Grainger, a professional services consultant at the Incorporated
Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, says: 'The recession has given auction
houses a new lease of life.'
According to Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
the accountancy firm, the number of companies which went into receivership
last year is expected to exceed 6,000  - more than four times the 1989
total. That means boom-time for auction houses called in to sell off assets.
Auctioneers are moving into bigger premises, profits are up and staff are
being recruited.
Henry Butcher, the plant and machinery specialist, is a typical beneficiary.
In 1989 the company held 57 sale days. There were 92 in 1990 and more than
190 sale days last year.
According to Mr John Judson, principal auctioneer at Henry Butcher, the mid
1980s were a buoyant time, with healthy prices and about 60 sale days a
year. But there is nothing like a downturn to boost income for auctioneers.
'The past year has been even better than 1982, with more sales at a higher
value. Items are not fetching as good a price as in the late 80s, but the
increased number of sales has added significantly to our income,' Mr Judson
says.
Profits are also up at the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith,
the plant and machinery auctioneer. Stickley &amp; Kent, which handles property
repossessions, has tripled its auction staff, and the department is moving
to larger offices in central London. The auction department at Edward
Rushton, the international valuers and surveyors, says it has never been
busier.
Different sales attract different people, but they share one trait: the
desire to buy cheap. Specialist plant and machinery auctions appeal almost
exclusively to dealers and industrialists. Other sales, such as a recent
Henry Butcher auction for Prudential at which 1,600 IBM computers were sold
for about Pounds 400 each, are more likely to attract the general public.
The auctions are often heady affairs. More than 1,000 people attend the big
sales and takings can easily exceed Pounds 1m  - from which the auction
houses usually take a 10 per cent cut.
Auctioneers can also profit from the inexperience of bidders and the
excitement of the occasion, which can lead bidders to pay more for a lot
than its market price. At a recent Henry Butcher auction for a large
property developer, the managing director's Bentley sold for Pounds 33,000,
Pounds 6,000 more than its trade value.
Mr Judson stops the bidding when it gets ridiculous. 'People often get
carried away, especially when a couple of them have got it in for one
another, but if they overbid it makes it difficult to collect any payment,'
he says.
While industrial salerooms thrive during recessions, they are keen to shed
their image of being industrial vultures.
Auctioneers claim they are contributing to the preservation of Britain's
manufacturing base by helping businesses which are strapped for cash to buy
quality products at a bargain price.
The auctions, they say, are an effective way for receivers to realise
capital when assets have to be sold.
Environmental arguments are also put forward by the auctioneers, who argue
that the sales provide an effective method of recycling equipment, machinery
and premises.
But the recession has not brought unmitigated prosperity for the sales
houses, with the severity of the downturn posing a few problems. In some
areas, for example, the market has been flooded  - there are several
night-clubs for sale in Oxfordshire at the moment  - which makes it
difficult to raise a realistic price.
Mr John Liddiment, head of the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp;
Smith, says that customers are less bid-happy than they were in the late
1980s. In 1988 lots were being bid for at an average of 120 per hour at
auctions. Last year it was down to 90.
Mr Edwin Kirker, head of insolvency at accountants Pannell Kerr Forster,
says: 'People are not flocking to auctions with money and it is difficult to
make money because there is so much stuff on the market. A buyer can usually
turn to at least two or three receivers to get what he wants.'
Some auction houses are struggling. Property auctioneers are selling more
houses than ever before, but prices have plummeted. At Barnard Marcus, the
estate agent and property auctioneer, houses are selling for Pounds 30,000
to Pounds 100,000 rather than up to Pounds 500,000. Overheads have gone up
as well as turnover, and overall takings are down by 50 per cent.
The art auctions are also struggling. The three big money-spinners  -
Impressionist, Modern and American contemporary works  - have all fallen
flat. Sotheby's and Christie's have experienced a sharp fall in turnover and
profits.
Henry Butcher might not like it, but in some quarters at least, a recovery
would be good news.
