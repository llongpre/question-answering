   An avid football fan is hoping to score with a
book designed to help people tell the difference between the
end-around and the end zone.
   ``Football For Men And Women Who Want To Learn The Game,''
teaches the beginning fan the fundamentals of professional
football, author Donna Foehr said. It also contains information
about college, high school, pee-wee and Canadian football, she
added.
   ``Football is not for everyone, but there are a lot of people
who want to learn more about the game,'' she said.
   Foehr, 57, of suburban Bloomfield Hills, said she has gone to
football games for as long as she can remember and is a
season-ticket holder for Michigan State and Detroit Lions games.
   Almost all topics of the game are defined in the $9.95 book
published by National Press, from the dimensions of the field to
little-used plays like the drop kick.
   ``It took me about five months to write the book but once that
was done, I spent about 500 hours re-editing it,'' she said. ``It
seemed that every time the publisher sent me changes in the
manuscript, I would change them back again and that went on several
times.''

   Candidate David Hales apparently doesn't
believe in staying close to his intended constituency. He's
attending college about 3,000 miles away in Massachusetts while
seeking a Washington lawmaker's post.
   Hales, who is 18 and from Renton, near Seattle, easily won the
Democratic primary for state representative, but he was the only
one on the ballot.
   Hales, a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge on an ROTC scholarship, left Washington state Aug. 25 and
has not actively campaigned for the seat now held by state Rep.
Bruce Holland, a Republican.
   ``I think a few of his friends are helping David but I haven't
seen any yard signs and don't know if they have been doorbelling,''
said Hales' mother, Martha.
   Why, if he didn't intend to campaign, did Hales file for office?
   ``David is interested in politics and the system and just wanted
to get involved and so decided to run for the Legislature,'' said
Mrs. Hales.
   Attempts to contact Hales at MIT were unsuccessful.
   As to Hales' candidacy, Holland said he isn't too happy with the
situation.
   ``I've taken a position on several issues and there's nobody
here to argue the other side so I don't get any feedback,'' said
Holland. ``I'll win because I'm here and he's not.''

   Most folks would be happy with $1 million but
not Lois Whitcomb. Wisconsin lottery's first $1 million winner says
she's ready to try for another million during a trip to Las Vegas.
   Mrs. Whitcomb, who runs a steak house with her husband in
Larsen, near Oshkosh, said they were going to a convention of
tavern owners in Las Vegas.
   ``I'll probably win a million out there,'' joked Mrs. Whitcomb,
who had the winning number in Saturday's drawing for the $1 million
prize. The trip had been planned before she became one of 10
finalists for the lottery drawing.
   Her actual winnings work out to about $730,000 after taxes,
which she will get in 20 installments of $36,535. She said the
money will not change her life.
   ``I just feel regular, everyday,'' the 46-year-old mother of
seven said Sunday, although ``I won't be working every weekend, I
hope.''
   Her husband, Robert, 66, who has had heart surgery, did not feel
well enough to attend the drawing Saturday, when he was
hospitalized briefly.
   ``Every time I get a little problem, they take me in,'' he said.
``I would like to have been there to give her a hug and a kiss.''
   The Wisconsin lottery started Sept. 14.
