Sporting his new title and a broad smile notably absent from his sober 
publicity photos, music director designate Yoav Talmi returned to the San Diego 
Symphony over the weekend. On Saturday night, the Israeli conductor exuded an 
extra measure of confidence, although in five previous visits he surely has 
never appeared obsequious. The orchestra's recently announced choice of Talmi, 
after a two-year search for a music director, has clearly bolstered his morale 
and his command of the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The program was a Mozart and Mahler combination plate, evidently one of Talmi's 
favorite recipes, since he will open the orchestra's 1989-90 season with the 
same pair of composers. His affinity for and appreciation of Mahler's First 
Symphony ("Titan") was evident at every turn. He allowed the episodic work to 
unfold generously, never forcing the pace but carefully shaping each movement. 
Only in the middle of the finale did he momentarily lose the tension and focus 
that underlies Mahler's exotic tonal tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second movement, he demanded a Landler defined by unrelenting 
sharp-edged rhythms, and the orchestra responded with rhythmic precision and 
the appropriate piquant colors that made the entire section sparkle. In both of 
the middle movements, Talmi kept the melodies shimmering above finely tuned 
accompaniments. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi wisely saved the major decibels for the thunderous climax of the last 
movement, which displayed the orchestra's more resonant forte of the season. 
Although the horns, expanded to eight for this symphony given to stentorian 
outbursts, acquitted their tasks honorably, the trumpets under the brilliant 
leadership of principal Calvin Price proved to be the thoroughbreds of the 
Mahler brass. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi's Mozart was less successful than his Mahler, but it was not all his 
fault. Mozart's C Major Oboe Concerto, K. 271k is routine in the extreme, 
especially compared to the composer's deservedly better-known Clarinet 
Concerto, K. 622. And, although Allan Vogel is one of the most elegant oboe 
virtuosos in captivity, he played below his own high standards Saturday night. 
Dropping a few notes along the way is no crime, but he seemed hemmed in by the 
opening movement's busy coloratura nonsense, and his usual rich timbre sounded 
on the anemic side. Fortunately his characteristic sonority returned in the 
freedom of the cadenzas and in the concluding rondo. Talmi had reduced the 
orchestra to a mere 35 players for this modest concerto, but even that was a 
bit heavy for the delicate sound of the oboe. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mozart's Overture to "The Abduction From the Seraglio" is one of the 
composer's more foolproof overtures, Talmi and the orchestra gave this program 
opener compelling energy and a sprightly sheen. The overture followed the 
symphony's announcement of a gift of $500,000 from Judson and Rachel Grosvenor 
to underwrite Talmi's next four years with the San Diego Symphony. Judson 
Grosvenor is a member of the symphony's board of directors and serves on its 
executive committee. Now that Talmi and the orchestra are starting their 
honeymoon, it is no doubt reassuring for the orchestra to boast a modest dowry 
in addition to its sizable debt.
