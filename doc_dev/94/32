Saturday will be a busy day at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the museum is holding a panel discussion in 
conjunction with the exhibit, "American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove." 
A lunch will follow the program at 12:30 p.m. At 2 p.m., the museum will show 
"Inter/National," a program of narrative and documentary videos. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the panel discussion will be video artists Doug Hall and Bill 
Viola; David Ross, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and 
moderator William D. Judson, curator of film and video at the Carnegie Museum 
of Art in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Judson was the curator of "American Landscape Video," which includes work by 
Hall and Viola. Ross, an art video expert, has written an essay for the exhibit 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $10 general, $7.50 for students and seniors. The lunch will cost 
$12 per person. 
</P>
<P>
"Inter/National" is part of an "LA Freewaves," a three-week celebration of 
video sponsored by the city Department of Cultural Affairs in Los Angeles and 
participating groups. 
</P>
<P>
One of four "road shows" traveling to various Southern California sites, 
"Inter/National" includes "Stories of Three Friends," the refugee experiences 
of three boys from Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, and a documentary about an 
American who introduced dance to disabled students of Changchun University a 
few months before the student protests in the People's Republic last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the screening is free with museum admission ($3 general, $2 for 
students and seniors, $1 for children ages 6 to 17). 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1., a free 3 p.m. show by Los Angeles performance artist Tim Miller 
will be the highlight of "A Day Without Art: A National Day of Action and 
Mourning" at the Newport museum. 
</P>
<P>
Part of a national art museum event in honor of AIDS Awareness Day, "A Day 
Without Art" seeks to honor and recognize colleagues who have died or are dying 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and greater support and recognition of 
AIDS sufferers from the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor will also offer free admission to the museum Dec. 1 and (from 
noon to 3 p.m.) an AIDS information table. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's 50-minute performance combines excerpts from three of his 
autobiographical works from the last six years: "Buddy Systems," "Some Golden 
States" and "Stretch Marks." Miller grew up in Whittier and attended La Habra 
High School before becoming a leading figure in the New York performance art 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"A Day Without Art" was organized by VISUAL AIDS, a New York organization of 
arts professionals that promotes AIDS-related exhibitions and events. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 U.S. arts groups are participating in the event, among them the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Getty 
Museum in Malibu and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The second annual AIDS Awareness Day is a project of the World Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Information: (714)
