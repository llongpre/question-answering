   Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art
designed to draw the viewer into the picture.
   ``People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist
Mary Lucier. ``It screens out distractions. It draws you into a
completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of
like going to the movies.''
   A new exhibit, ``American Landscape Video: The Electronic
Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading
video artists, including Lucier.
   The show, on display through July 10 at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
Museum of Art, features bright moving images that appear on video
monitors illuminating darkened rooms.
   The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds
call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging
amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water.
   The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the
video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one
work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own
images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream.
   ``Each space creates its own environment,'' Lucier says. ``The
impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as
well as moving images and three dimensional objects.''
   Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it
would be like watching television, but they usually like the works
once they see them, said Bill Judson, film curator at the Carnegie.
   ``People come in and they see this and they say, `My God, I love
that,''' he said. ``They're astonished in themselves.''
   Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology
made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early
'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some
artists used color computer-generated images in their work.
   In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney
Museum of American Art have displayed video works, but many smaller
museums can't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, Judson
said.
   ``There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not
getting exposure,'' he said.
   In Lucier's ``Wilderness,'' three videotapes are shown
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals. She
filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century American landscape
artists such as Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, showing gleaming
icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky.
   One work, ``Room for St. John on the Cross,'' has a gyrating
image of mountain tops projected on a large sreen. In the center of
the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single window.
A voice reciting in Spanish can be heard, and a white-capped
mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the cube.
   Artist Bill Viola said the work is based on a Spanish mystic who
wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite
being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell.
   Doug Hall's ``The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described,''
features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire,
tornadoes whirling and storms at sea. Within the gallery, a steel
fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two
oversized, stainless steel high-backed chairs.
   In ``The Allure of the Concentric'' by Rita Myers, four monitors
amid large volcanic rocks show closeup views of leaves and weeds,
dry cracked ground and the silhouette of stark tree trunks against
sky.
   Frank Gillette placed eight eye-level monitors in a square,
showing reeds in a marsh, birds flying and other wildlife in the
wilderness north of Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Around the corner, the viewer stands in the center of a ring of
eight monitors showing natural and colorized images that Steina
Vasulka created of New Mexican mountains and the desert.
   In Dara Birnbaum's ``Will-O'-The Wisp,'' three monitors placed
in a panel show a woman amidst trees as a woman's voice speaks
about a former lover.
