<P>
A dissident movement inside the United Auto Workers union, seeking to curb 
labor-management cooperation in the auto industry, has suffered a series of 
political setbacks in local union elections in recent days, the group 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the dissidents charge that the UAW leadership has engaged in widespread 
election fraud and say they plan to appeal the results, both at the union's 
national convention in Anaheim in June and in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
UAW officials deny the charges, but admit that the bitter election campaign may 
lead to a serious rift within the nation's most influential industrial union. 
</P>
<P>
Donny Douglas, a charismatic local union leader from Pontiac, Mich., has lost 
his bid to unseat an incumbent UAW regional director in the Detroit area, and 
thus gain a seat on the union's governing executive board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another dissident, Jerry Tucker, is also apparently losing in his 
campaign for re-election as regional director in the St. Louis area. UAW 
officials say Tucker, who won the seat in a court-ordered election last fall, 
has been unseated by a candidate backed by union President Owen Bieber, but 
Tucker has not yet conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, a longtime dissident who has frequently opposed contract concessions 
in the auto industry, campaigned against a wide array of joint labor-management 
programs that have been accepted by the UAW's leadership. He charged that those 
"team-oriented" programs have done little more than give management extra 
leverage over workers, and have eroded the union's power on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Victories 
</P>
<P>
At first, his assaults against the UAW leadership's willingness to work more 
closely with management galvanized many rank-and-file workers at General 
Motors, and they flocked to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He swept to early landslide victories in locals at GM plants in the eastside 
Detroit region. His success stunned UAW leaders, and they fought back hard. 
</P>
<P>
UAW staffers were asked to contribute $500 apiece to finance a campaign to stop 
Douglas and Tucker, and Bieber and other UAW leaders visited plants throughout 
the two regions with contested elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Douglas failed to gain enough votes in the many Chrysler plants in 
the east Detroit region, and lost to incumbent Bob Lent, who was originally 
from a Chrysler local. At the same time, Tucker was trailing Roy Wyse, a former 
assistant regional director who was backed by Bieber. 
</P>
<P>
Another test for the dissident movement came Tuesday, when workers at Mazda's 
new U.S. assembly plant outside Detroit, now represented by the UAW, voted for 
local union officers for the first time. Phillip Keeling, a dissident running 
under Douglas' "New Directions" banner, was challenging a UAW-backed candidate, 
Bill Judson. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling was running in opposition to the union's acceptance of Mazda's 
Japanese-style workplace policies, most notably kaizen, a Japanese term defined 
as the search for continuous improvement. The dissidents at Mazda claim kaizen 
is just a Japanese word for a speed-up, and insist that the union should not 
work so closely with Mazda to achieve kaizen. 
</P>
<P>
Judson and the UAW leadership, meanwhile, argue that the union should work with 
Mazda to modify kaizen, without rejecting it completely. 
</P>
<P>
A dissident victory in the union fight at Mazda, one of three Japanese-managed 
U.S. assembly plants where workers now have UAW representation, could represent 
a fundamental challenge to Japanese efforts to import their management 
techniques to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Results from the Mazda election were not available late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their losses in the regional elections, leaders of the dissident group 
vowed to continue their fight at the UAW convention in Anaheim where delegates 
selected in the local elections will then actually choose regional directors 
and other union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the UAW leadership now seems assured of a majority of delegates for 
its regional candidates, Pete Kelly, a longtime UAW dissident and Douglas' 
campaign manager, vowed to challenge their credentials. He charges fraud in 
many of the local elections where pro-Bieber delegates were swept in. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly also vowed to take the UAW's leadership to court on charges of election 
fraud if Douglas loses at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges of Fraud 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Kelly alleges that the UAW leadership illegally used union 
and management resources to campaign for Administration-backed candidates. At 
one Ford plant in suburban Detroit, for example, the company agreed to shut 
down production for 45 minutes to allow Bieber to speak to workers just before 
the local election there. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker also charges fraud, and has already protested 11 local elections in his 
region. "They are systematically stealing the thing," Tucker said. "The 
position of the Bieber people is to win at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
UAW officials deny they have used improper tactics to win. "It's not surprising 
they would make those charges and use exaggerated rhetoric," said UAW spokesman 
Peter Laarman. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials privately acknowledge that the strength of the dissident 
movement caught the leadership off guard, and may force the union to rethink 
some of its joint programs with management.
