<LEADPARA>  The executive directors of the Big West Conference will vote at the end of the
month on whether Nevada-Reno should be invited to join the conference, a
league spokesman said Friday.;    San Jose State Athletic Director Tom
Brennan, for one, is confident Reno will get the necessary three-fourths vote

<TEXT>     "They returned very impressed," Brennan said. "I think Reno will be in,
probably for '92.";    That would coincide with the departure of Fresno State,
which accepted an invitation in June to join the Western Athletic Conference
after the 1991-92 school year.;    Nevada-Reno, which currently is in the
Division I-AA Big Sky Conference, has the facilities and attendance to qualify
as a Division I-A school.;    At its meeting July 30 through Aug. 2 in Los
Angeles, the Big West also will discuss approaching Long Beach State and
Fullerton State about dropping Division I-A football and joining UC-Irvine and
UC-Santa Barbara as conference schools that do not compete in that sport,
Brennan said. Long Beach State and Fullerton State were ranked second-to-last
and last, respectively, in attendance among Division I-A schools last season.  </TEXT>
