<HEAD>No Strings Pulled to Stay Out of Vietnam, Quayle Says</HEAD>

   A George Bush aide said Wednesday that Dan
Quayle was asked, before being selected as running mate, whether
strings were pulled to get him into the National Guard and avoid
service in Vietnam. Quayle said none were, the aide recounted.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the National Guard. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' Robert Teeter told
reporters.
   ``He, at some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone
else','' said Teeter, who oversaw Bush's vice presidential
selection process.
   Quayle himself, in an interview on CBS, said he was ``almost
certain'' that the governor or lieutenant governor of Indiana were
not asked to help him get in the National Guard in 1969.
   ``Many of us got in,'' he said, adding that he was speaking on
the basis of recollections that are 20 years old.
   At the time, men Quayle's age were being drafted into the Army
and many were sent to Vietnam.
   In an interview with ABC News, Quayle said he chose the National
Guard _ rather than risking the draft _ because that course allowed
him to fulfill his military obligation and still attend law school.
   But if his National Guard unit had been called up _ none were
during the Vietnam War _ he said he ``would have gone and served
very proudly.''
   And he told CNN: ``I was willing and ready to serve my country.
I chose to serve my country in the National Guard like millions of
other people.''
   The question arose as every aspect of Quayle's life came under
intense scrutiny following his surprise selection by Bush Tuesday.
   An NBC-owned Washington, D.C. television station, WRC-TV, said
Quayle ``may have received help from then Indiana Gov. Edgar
Whitcomb.'' Citing Republican sources it did not name, the station
said Quayle was working as an administrative assistant in the
governor's office in 1969 and Whitcomb moved Quayle to the top of a
``lengthy'' waiting list for enrollment in the guard.
   However, Quayle's biography showed that he had not started
working for Whitcomb until 1971, two years after he joined the
National Guard.
   Jeff Nesbit, Quayle press secretary, told of the television
station's report, said: ``I can say nothing more than what he
(Quayle) said. Basically some of the other folks he went to college
with wanted to get in and most of them got in. What he said has to
stand at this time.''
