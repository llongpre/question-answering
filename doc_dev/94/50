   BOUNTY-HUNTER AUDITS of property tax are shot down in two
Southeast states.
   In both, counties hired contractors to audit businesses'
non-realty "personal" property, such as machinery -- in
return for 35% of any added revenue. In February, on a plea
by Sears Roebuck, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the use of
contractors but unanimously outlawed contingency-fee deals as
a threat to fairness. Now North Carolina's Property Tax
Commission, noting the Georgia opinion, has voted 3-2 to void
Cabarrus County's addition of $548 million to the value of
Philip Morris's property.

   The rulings are major setbacks for governments considering
"bounty-hunter" contingency-fee deals to bolster their
collections, says James W. Shea, a New York lawyer
representing Philip Morris. Cabarrus County plans to appeal
to the state courts, says its lawyer, Charles C. Meeker of
Raleigh; but it is considering switching to hourly fee
contracts -- as are other counties -- and plans to reaudit
the company.
   The contingency fees in Georgia and North Carolina were
based on assessments of penalties as well as taxes.
                                                                                                       

   SELF-EMPLOYERS who get Social Security may have
misreported 1990 income. Social Security benefits are limited
for people under 70 who also earn pay above certain sums;
recipients must report wages and net self-employment earnings
on Social Security Form SSA-777-BK. But the 1990 form didn't
specify which self-employment figure to take from Schedule SE
of the 1990 tax return, notes tax adviser Robert E. Judson of
Chatsworth, Calif.; many filers may have used the wrong one,
from SE Line 3, not the right smaller one from Line 4.
   A filer who reported too much self-employment earnings to
Social Security may be asked to pay back benefits he actually
is entitled to, Judson says. Social Security printed its form
before the IRS revised the 1990 Schedule SE to use Line 4 to
reflect a new deduction. People who reported a wrong figure
may file a corrected form, Social Security says. Or they may
call 800-234-5772 and make the correction by phone.
                                                                                                       

   A BIG TAX BILL EVOLVES for the originator of the specious
foreign trust. A popular tax scam of the 1970s was created by
Karl L. Dahlstrom; he told clients to hide assets and income
under tiers of foreign trusts and got up to $12,000 for such
advice. His conviction on charges of aiding the preparation
of false returns was reversed in 1983 because the legality of
the scheme was "unsettled" in the 1970s. But courts in many
subsequent civil tax cases found the trusts to be shams and
imposed civil fraud penalties on the taxpayers.
   Yet Dahlstrom, of College Station, Texas, persisted in
pressing appeals for his own family trusts in two Tax Court
cases covering 1977 through 1983. Now Judge Scott and Special
Judge Pajak have found Dahlstrom's trusts to be no more fit
for survival than his clients' and have upheld IRS claims for
$2.4 million in back taxes.
   The judges also upheld 50% civil-fraud penalties and other
penalties, in addition to interest.
                                                                                                       

   A BIRTHDAY SUIT didn't cover this: Lloyd S. Rohlig, a
Marietta, Ga., accountant, claimed certain unreported income
must be birthday gifts because he deposited it in the bank on
his birthday. The Tax Court found the argument novel, but
unbelievable, in rejecting his suit for relief from taxes and
civil fraud penalties.
                                                                                                       

   CORPORATE GROUPS that want to stop consolidating units'
returns needn't seek IRS approval by Sunday, says Revenue
Procedure 91-39; it delays that initial deadline until after
final rules appear. Many companies want to deconsolidate to
escape temporary IRS rules that deny deductions of losses
from selling consolidated units.
                                                                                                       

   DELINQUENTS' TAX DEBTS, including interest and penalties,
grew nearly 11% in fiscal 1990 to $96.3 billion, Paul Posner
of the General Accounting Office told a Senate hearing. But
the GAO expects $24 billion to be abated because of errors
and $46 billion to be written off after 10 years as unabated,
uncollected, or uncollectible.
                                                                                                       

   FOREIGN-CONTROLLED companies face complex new accounting
chores. Two sets of IRS rules are to carry out 1989 law meant
to keep the units from fudging on U.S. taxes. Final rules on
reporting dealings with foreign affiliates and supplying
their records have been liberalized a bit. Smaller units are
absolved of records-keeping; large ones may negotiate records
deals with the IRS, notes Robert Cole, a Washington lawyer.
But the basic requirement to provide detailed foreign records
or pay "Draconian" penalties remains, says Eli Fink of
Deloitte &amp; Touche, CPAs.
   The IRS also proposed rules limiting corporate deductions
of interest paid to foreign affiliates, a move to bar
disguised transfers of untaxed profits. The rules would give
foreign parents, especially those with several U.S. units,
many calculation headaches, says Marianne Burge of Price
Waterhouse, CPAs. And the rules leave many open issues, such
as the definition of debt and the treatment of a parent's
guarantee of a third-party loan. Burge questions "whether
these rules are workable."
   The IRS seeks comments on the rules and plans a hearing on
them Sept. 25.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: A bill proposed by Rep. Grandy (R., Iowa) would
offer businesses a 20% credit for gifts to apprenticeship
programs . . . . A private eye posing as a client's employee
appears on the client's payroll to protect his cover story
but doesn't keep that pay. IRS private ruling 9118002 says he
needn't report the pay on his return.
