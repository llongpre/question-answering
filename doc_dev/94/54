   In a little valley known as Griffin Creek,
Jane Watson Hopping is writing old-time cookbooks that have as much
to say about what has brought her happiness as how to make Uncle
Bud's old-fashioned vinegar pie.
   She and and her husband, Ray, have run what they call a ``sea preserving
a
way of life with which most people seem to be out of touch.
   With a son and daughter grown and much of the farm sold off for
houses, Hopping began a project of writing down for her children
the old family recipes she had learned in her own mother's kitchen
and carried in her head: such things as Denver biscuits, golden egg
bread and Aunt Ida Louise's chocolatey wacky cake with dusted
powdered sugar lace.
   But the recipes didn't get published until Hopping mixed in some
memories of growing up on a farm during the Depression and seasoned
them with poems and pictures gleaned from forgotten
turn-of-the-century books.
   ``The Pioneer Lady's Country Kitchen,'' published last year by
Villard Books, earned warm praise from reviewers. Hopping has come
back this year with ``The Pioneer Lady's Country Christmas'' and is
working on a third book for next year, to be called ``Country
Mothers.''
   She became known as the ``pioneer lady'' in the local schools,
where she taught children how to make deer-fat candles, churn
butter, tan hides and barter three different ways.
   More than anything else, her books are about memories: kitchen
memories, barnyard memories, family memories.
   ``I would tell the children, `Every day of your life you are in
the memory business _ good memories and bad,''' she said. ``You
look on your life and you find that I have lived such a happy and
successful life, and that's because you created every day good
memories. If you created only bad memories, when you look back, you
don't have anything to feel good about.''
   The inspiration for the books came from an old primer from a
school in Eagle Point. The primer contained an etching of a young
girl standing in a barnyard that reminded Hopping of her own
childhood.
   ``I think it released me, in a sense, to tell about my family,
myself,'' she said. ``Maybe prior to that I was trying to do some
kind of writing, but you know, not revealing myself.''
   Also in the primer were poems by James Whitcomb Riley, the
Hoosier poet of Indiana, including ``The Frost Is on the Pumpkin.''
   ``I thought, `Oh, that's what I need for my cookbook to make a
setting like in a ring,''' she said. ``As it turned out, the
setting was equally important to the recipes.''
   At book signings, Hopping hears more about how people enjoyed
her memories than about how they enjoyed the food.
   ``I've had my first fan letter,'' she said. ``A young woman in
California said, `I love your book and I bought one for my sister.'
She said: `We're going to change our life a little bit. We're going
to make pomander balls and have more family picnics.'
   ``She's finding something in there that she thinks would make
their life richer. That's wonderful, for a cookbook.''
   Besides Christmas goodies, ``The Pioneer Lady's Country
Christmas'' is filled with the stories that come out during family
gatherings: how Grandmother nursed neighbors in southwestern
Missouri during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1908, and was
thanked just before Christmas with an anonymous gift of a crate
filled with toys and clothes; how Uncle Will would tie himself to
the barn in a blizzard so he wouldn't get lost while tending to the
animals.
   ``Christmas means family to me,'' said Hopping. ``When I was
growing up, we had an extended family. Then you didn't move around
so much. You had your friends sometimes for 30 or 40 years.
   ``When I look back at Christmas, what I enjoy the most is not
the food. I enjoy fixing the food and all that. That's part of life
for Christmas. But I enjoy the coming together of the family.''
   Though she was born in Kansas in 1929, when her father was
working on a gas pipeline, Hopping proudly traces her roots to
pioneer stock in Missouri.
   During the Depression, the family had spread out looking for
work, leaving her grandfather alone in Missouri.
   ``None of the family could stand this, because this was a very
clannish family,'' she said.
   So they all decided to move to California, where Hopping's
father eventually became foreman at a limestone quarry in the gold
country town of Auburn.
   She grew up knowing the joys of sharing, even in times when
there wasn't much to share. ``In the old days, it was what you were
going to do for your friends,'' she said. ``People would say: `I am
going to sit here and knit collars until everybody in the family
has a lace collar. I'm going to go out in the barn every night
after I worked hard in the fields and I am going to make doll
cradles.'''
   She married Ray Hopping, who gave up his job on the railroad
back in California, and in 1958 they moved to the farm in Griffin
Creek, where they keep the old ways.
   ``In Griffin Creek, we still trade about ourselves,'' she said.
``It's not uncommon to find some apples sitting on your shelf. The
neighbors share back and forth with the work.
   ``I guess that one reason I continue to write about the old days
is because I really kind of live in a time that's not changed that
much.''
