<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA'S shrinks must have an upsurge of clients this time every year:
Midwesterners and New Englanders coming in with their vague seasonal
depressions. Have the psychiatrists and psychologists identified their malady?
It's the nagging guilt of people who, on the one hand, rejoice as they send
their children out to trick-or-treat in flimsy tutus and papery pajamas and
yet, on the other hand, melt into puddles of unresolved mourning because
there's no frost on the punkin.;   Well, if shrinks haven't identified this
disorder, newspaper writers have. And much as I would like to avoid a cliched
introduction to this roundup of children's books about harvest time, I can't.
Too many of the nicest new books celebrate genuine "fodder in the shock"
autumns and sugar-maple locales -- and it seems impossible to write about them
without resorting to James Whitcomb Riley.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A CORNUCOPIA OF HARVEST NOSTALGIA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Muller, the book editor of the Mercury News, writes about children's books the
second Sunday of each month.; Children's Books  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His almost-hopelessly dated dialect poem is nicely illustrated by Glenna
Lang in "When the Frost Is on the Punkin" (Godine, 30 pp., $15.95). Lang
portrays the "feller" who "a-feeling at his best . . . goes out to feed the
stock" as a pony-tailed girl in a lavender sweat suit. It's not
equal-pay-for-equal-work, but it's a little something to be thankful for.;  
There's a Riley-like nostalgia in Laura Jane Coats' "The Almond Orchard"
(Macmillan, 32 pp., $14.95), but that's certainly not its main appeal. Coats,
a native Californian who lives in San Francisco, writes a richly detailed
account of almond harvests early in the century and now. The information is
set within a pencil-and-watercolor storybook about a girl who grows up
watching harvests that require lots of hand labor and who grows old in an era
when the harvest is almost completely mechanized.;   This is fascinating
stuff. Decades ago, workers spread tarps under the trees and then beat the
branches with long-handled rubber mallets to shake the nuts free. (Young men
got $1 a day to "knock almonds.") The tarps were then dragged to a shed where
the women removed the green hulls. The almonds were laid in the sun to dry,
raked often and then shoveled into bags. Horse-drawn wagons hauled the nuts to
the train, and the city.;   These days, a machine with spinning brushes like a
street sweeper's is driven up a tree. Huge metal fingers, like a tuning fork,
grasp the trunk and shake down an almond shower. A mechanical sweeper pushes
the almonds into rows that the mechanical pickup machine vacuums up. A
mechanical huller cleans the nuts before they go to a processing plant. The
nuts are shelled, and the shells burned to power the processing plant.;   The
harvest is the most interesting part of the book, but the whole almond life
cycle is represented. Almonds aren't a typical "crop" for books of this sort,
and the rural California-ness of this enterprise is also rare in children's
books. The dust jacket says that the little girl of the story is the author's
grandmother; we might hope that Coats' other grandmother cut 'cots as a girl,
or made date shakes at a roadside stand, or fed chicks in Petaluma.;   "Corn
Belt Harvest" by Raymond Bial (Houghton-Mifflin, 48 pp., $14.95) is a more
typical example of children's non-fiction: pitched to older kids, focused on a
mega-crop, written competently and illustrated with color photographs (and
grain doesn't come more picturesque than corn). It caught my eye mostly
because I'm a recovering Hoosier, but it would be a nice addition to any
school library. It's especially informative about grain elevators -- a
revelation to kids who know only the passenger kind.;   Field corn in full
Kodachrome is pretty bright, but "Corn Belt Harvest" is not the fall's most
colorful book. That honor would go to Lois Ehlert's "Red Leaf, Yellow Leaf"
(Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 36 pp., $14.95), an eye-dazzling example of this
popular collage artist's work. Ehlert, whose earlier books include "Color
Zoo," "Fish Eyes" and "Planting a Rainbow," tells the story of sugar maple
tree for little kids (and adds some text at the back for parents and older
siblings who want to read about how to plant a tree). The pleasure here is a
pure one -- color so vibrant it almost hums.;   The apotheosis of autumn and
harvest can be found in "Witch Hazel" (HarperCollins, 32 pp., $14.95), a book
that's wonderful in as many ways as there are pumpkin seeds in a Half Moon Bay
prize-winner. Hazel, a scarecrow made of two witch-hazel branches and an old
gingham dress, is created by Johnny to protect a struggling pumpkin vine.
Johnny, who appears to be motherless, is heir to all the wonderful old fairy
tales in which the third son triumphs. His two older brothers, though kind,
doubt his competence at every turn: He's always too little, too young, too
inexperienced. (There are echoes of a modern classic, too: "The Carrot Seed"
by Ruth Krauss and Crockett Johnson.);    As the older brothers get ready to
go to the Harvest Fair (Johnny can't go because they "won't be home 'til
morning"), they volunteer to try to sell the one small "one-pie" pumpkin he's
raised. Hazel, though she has not been scary enough to protect a whole crop,
has sheltered one pumpkin beneath her hem. Johnny shakes his head. "Hazel
saved the best one. It's not for sale." That night Johnny watches as Hazel
comes alive to hang the harvest moon.;   Author Alice Schertle writes this
magical story with just the right tone of understatement, and her dialogue
among the taciturn brothers is expert. Margot Tomes is the perfect
illustrator: Hazel, essentially faceless, manages to have a wide range of
expressions and a unique scarecrow grace. Tomes' palette is pleasing and
autumnal: colors that a Tweeds catalog might call cinnamon, ginger, russet,
tassel, milkweed, aubergine.;   In the poem I most love to recite to my
children (William Jay Smith's "A Pavane for the Nursery"), there's a line,
"I'll love you as long as the furrow the plow." Hazel gives Johnny that kind
of timeless love and gravity-certain comfort, and the children and parents who
meet them will share their joy. (box)  </TEXT>
