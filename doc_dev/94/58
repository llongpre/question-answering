<HEAD>Consumer Division Work Was Overstated, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sen. Dan Quayle's version of duties he handled
as a consumer watchdog when he worked for the Indiana attorney
general in 1970-71 appear to be exaggerated, an Ohio newspaper
reports in its Friday editions.
   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported that state records in the
Indiana archives reveal that Quayle, 41, was a research assistant _
an entry-level job _ in the attorney general's office for most of
that time, and held the consumer watchdog job for only 2{ months,
from July to mid-September in 1971.
   Quayle's Senate biography, which is being distributed as
official background of the Republican vice-presidential nominee,
says: ``He was chief investigator for the Consumer Protection
Division of the Indiana Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.''
   The Plain Dealer reported that the division was just being
organized at the time.
   ``He just helped set it up,'' said Robert E. Lybrook, a lawyer
in Martinsville, Ind., who became the chief investigator in
September 1971, when the division officially opened for business.
   State personnel records show Quayle was already working for
then-Gov. Edgar Whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the
consumer division was officially launched.
   The consumer division had been created earlier in 1971 by the
Indiana Legislature. The division was empowered to help resolve
consumer complaints over such things as defective products, false
advertising, odometer tampering and mail-order fraud.
   ``I don't remember when Quayle first started out,'' said Robert
A. Smith, an Indianapolis lawyer who was the consumer division's
first director. Smith said Quayle was assigned to his staff for a
brief time before leaving to work in the governor's office.
   Said M. Stanton Evans, an editor at the Indianapolis News who
arranged Quayle's job interview with then-Attorney General Theodore
L. Sendak: ``He sure didn't start in that (consumer) job. He wasn't
chief of anything when he went over there.''
   Evans worked for Eugene C. Pulliam, publisher of Indiana's
largest newspapers and Quayle's grandfather.
   State records show that Quayle, who graduated from DePauw
University in May 1969 with a political science degree, went to
work in the attorney general's office as a ``legal assistant'' in
January 1970.
   The job is similar to that of a law clerk. It involved drafting
legal memoranda, performing research for opinions and writing
letters, according to other employees who worked in the attorney
general's office at the time. Quayle was attending night school at
Indiana University School of Law at the same time.
   The office's annual report, filed in the Indiana state archives,
shows Sendak didn't have a consumer division in 1970. Quayle's
picture was in the report with those of seven other research
assistants.
   Sendak's 1971 annual report, which he was required to file under
state law, has the pictures of the three staffers in the new
consumer division. The three included Smith, as the director,
Roland D. Mather as assistant director and Robert E. Lybrook as
chief investigator. Quayle was not even listed as being on the
attorney general's staff.
