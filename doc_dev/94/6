   JoBeth Williams will portray surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould in an ABC television movie about the landmark court
battle over custody of ``Baby M,'' a network spokeswoman said.
   The two-part movie, to air at an undetermined date this spring,
will also feature John Shea, Dabney Coleman and Bruce Weitz, ABC
spokeswoman Laurel Whitcomb said Tuesday.
   The goal of the movie ``is to tell the story without adopting
any one point of view,'' Ms. Whitcomb said in a telephone interview
from Los Angeles.
   The movie will include an update at the end because the case is
still unfolding, Ms. Whitcomb said.
   The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determine
the visitation schedule for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, whose parental
rights to the 22-month old child were restored in a New Jersey
Supreme Court decision earlier this month.
   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision that
upheld a $10,000 contract under which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was
artificially inseminated with William Stern's sperm and bore the
child for him and his wife, Elizabeth.
   In addition to stripping Mrs. Whitehead-Gould of her parental
rights, the lower court last March 31 awarded custody to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns but voided
the contract and ruled that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was entitled to a
hearing on visiting the child.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the Sterns have agreed to
try to reach an out-of-court settlement on visitation rights.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold Cassidy, said Tuesday
that his client would be seeking more visitation time than the
current two hours a week.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who originally called the child Sara,
``has agreed to call the child Melissa and do whatever it takes to
achieve harmony,'' the attorney said.
   Williams starred in ``The Big Chill,'' ``Poltergeist'' and
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' and received an Emmy nomination for her part
in the TV movie ``Adam.''
   Shea, who starred in ``Witness'' and ``Windy City,'' will
portray Stern. Coleman, star of television's ``The Slap Maxwell
Story'' will star as Gary Skoloff, the attorney representing the
Sterns.
   Weitz will portray Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's former husband,
Richard, whom she divorced last year.
   Robin Strasser will portray Elizabeth Stern and Anne Jackson
will star as Lorraine Abraham, Baby M's court-appointed guardian.
