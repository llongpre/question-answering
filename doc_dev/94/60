Mike Tansley never had a chance. And for that, he can thank Matt Hempel. 
</P>
<P>
Tansley, running the anchor leg of the boys' 4 x 1,600-meter relay at the Mt. 
San Antonio College Relays Friday, never got a chance to show his speed. 
</P>
<P>
Hempel, part of a brother combination for Walnut, broke the race open on the 
leg before Tansley got the baton, and Dana Hills was too far behind to make it 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Hempel got the baton back in fifth place but ran powerfully into the lead 
midway through his leg. And when he handed off to brother Scott, Walnut had a 
10-second lead on Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut went on to win in a meet-record 17 minutes 35.61 seconds, breaking Santa 
Barbara's 10-year-old standard of 17:42.8. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills, despite a fine 4:19.75 leg by Tansley, was a well-beaten second in 
17:44.77. Tansley had turned in a personal-best and school-record of 9:10.11 
for 3,200 two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Niednagel, Andrew Tansley and Dan Niednagel ran the first three legs for 
Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, thanks to a strong 4:17.5 anchor leg by Mike Nielsen, came from 
behind to take third in 17:47.94. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena was fifth in 18:02.27. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, with 600 meters to go in the boys' invitational 
3,000, a pack of about six runners -- including Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana 
Valley -- were bunched at the front. 
</P>
<P>
But David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit quickly ruined any hopes the others had of 
winning. Welsh used a long, drawn-out kick to win in a meet-record 8:23.11, 
breaking the old mark of 8:24.7 set by Ramon Gomez of L.A. Belmont in 1984. And 
in the process he pulled the field to some very fast times. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Ibarri of Mexico was second in 8:25.97, and Bryan Dameworth of Agoura was 
third in 8:29.02. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was fifth in 8:31.12, a personal best for the distance, which is run 
less often than the 3,200 in boys' competition. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar, who had run in third until just past the 1,600 
mark, finished seventh in 8:34.06. Lavelle will run the invitational 1,500 
today at 11:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams fared well in boys' 4 x 400 meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
Edison had the fastest time among county teams, running 3:24.97 for second in 
its race. Ken Arao, a transfer student from Japan, ran an unofficial 50.8 
leadoff leg, Matt Hart followed with a 53.8, Tom Tyler 50.5 and Dave Baker 50.0 
as Edison finished a close second to Leuzinger (3:24.44). 
</P>
<P>
Katella ran 3:26.84 to edge Valencia, which ran 3:26.88, to win its heat. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4 x 100 relay, Valencia's team of Eric Whitcomb, Rick Smith, Brian 
Anderson and Kevin Thomas ran 44.1 to win its heat over second-place Etiwanda 
(44.4) and third-place Edison.

Mt. SAC Notes 
</P>
<P>
The high school portion of the meet continues today at 8 a.m. . . . Brian 
Zeiler of Trabuco Hills won the pole vault with a leap of 13-feet-6. . . . Andy 
Marron of Dana Hills finished second to Terry Pearce of Paso Robles in the 
discus. Pearce outthrew Marron 154-7 1/2 to 144-9.
