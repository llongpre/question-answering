<LEADPARA>  WHAT really happened to make Meryl Streep leave her longtime mentor, New
York-based agent Sam Cohn, for CAA's Michael Ovitz in L.A.?;    Insiders say
it is a combination of things. First, the great Streep "went Hollywood" (in a
manner of speaking). She bought a house in the film colony and plans to have
her next baby there. Any minute!  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Second, she read the new Mike Nichols movie, "Remains of the Day," but then
Nichols decided not to cast her, even though she is one of his favorites and
they've made three movies together. The message was relayed to Streep through
agent Cohn, who then found himself "in the middle.";    Third, there are those
who say Streep has changed a lot. Her last few films have not been big at the
box office, and she is fretting over having passed the 40 mark -- the "problem
age" for actresses. One who seems to know says: "She has gone from being
legendary to difficult.";    Besides all this, Glenn Close -- who once left
agent Cohn's stable of biggies because she felt all the good parts were going
to Streep -- may very well be the actress with the inside track to play that
role opposite Jeremy Irons in "Remains of the Day." (Close and Irons
co-starred in "Reversal of Fortune.");     STILL A STAR: Elizabeth Taylor is
in Vogue! (Well, when is this great star ever not in vogue?) The coming June
issue features Miz Liz talking to writer Georgina Howell and posing for
dramatic Herb Ritts photos. (Infuriatingly, they save the best shot for the
table of contents, reduced to postage-stamp size. Go figure.);    As usual,
Taylor doesn't say anything she hasn't already said in one form or another.
Unlike those terminally candid divas, Cher and Madonna, Taylor really and
truly guards her privacy. She won't dish -- don't ask her. (I recall posing an
intimate question to her some years ago in Leningrad, during the filming of
"The Bluebird." She gazed at me, thumped a fist at her famous T-shirted bosom
and declared, "I've got it all locked up inside, and that's where it's going
to stay!") Still, Howell's piece is engaging and affectionate. It's amusing,
however, to find that she has added two inches to Taylor's height, putting her
at 5-6 (the star must have loved that!) while subtracting two of her seven
grandchildren.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood; FINALLY
FRANK: More than six years after its initial announcement, the Frank Sinatra
biographical miniseries is targeted for a production start in November.;   
The CBS Sinatra biopic originally was written by Abby Mann as an eight-hour
mini. It was rewritten by a second screenwriter, then finally landed with
writer Cynthia Whitcomb -- who was assigned to write a five-hour version of
the saga. She now has three of the five hours of script "in good shape,"
according to Gregg Maday, vice president of movies for TV and miniseries for
Warner Bros. "We're just working on the final two hours.";    Maday insists
the miniseries "promises not to be a puff piece" -- despite the fact that it's
being produced by Sinatra's daughter Tina.  </TEXT>
