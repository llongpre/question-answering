<LEADPARA>  'GEORGE M!" is a musical in the shape of a doughnut. No matter how many
jimmies, sugar spangles and colored frostings it has -- and San Jose Civic
Light Opera has quite a few on its spectacular season opener -- it's still got
a hole in the middle.;   Here the void is the biographee, George M. Cohan, a
smart Mick on the make who became a self-styled king of Broadway in the first
quarter of the 20th century. Cohan (1878-1942) started in a vaudeville act
with his parents and sister Josie; conquered Broadway in the smash hit "Little
Johnny Jones"; and became an important producer and theater owner.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He also wrote at least six songs that became instant classics: "Give My
Regards to Broadway," "Mary," "Harrigan," "A Grand Old Flag," "Yankee Doodle
Dandy" and "Over There," which won him a Congressional Medal of Honor for its
morale-boosting effect on the war effort.;   However, even the fawning script
(by Michael Stewart with John and Fran Pascal) can't disguise his egotism and
ambition. (Obviously, the musical is unrelated to James Cagney's 1942 "Yankee
Doodle Dandy," which Time called "possibly the most genial screen biography
ever made.");   No regrets;   Sooner or later Cohan insults everyone on the
stage on his trip to the top. He loses a wife, several producers, his father
and sister. None of it seems to bother him, and it certainly didn't bother me,
since no attempt was made to show the wit, zest or talent behind the
song-and-dance skills.;   Jamie Torcellini, brought back to play Cohan after
his rousing success in CLO's "Me and My Girl" last season, does his best to
impart some charm to George M. But he kept bumping up against a heavy, sodden
object like a rain-drenched haystack in the middle of the stage: the script.; 
 The musical's fine when it sticks to the routines of the Four Cohans, or to
his immensely singable, danceable songs, and there are a lot of smart tap
numbers (choreographed by director Sam Viverito) that could pull a smile out
of the Mock Turtle. But there are long dead spots where the book drones on and
on, trying to inject complexity into a life that didn't have any.;   What
happened? Who cares?;   For instance: Cohan captivates his first wife, Ethel,
with a buoyant song called "20th-Century Love," which covers courtship,
proposal, engagement, wedding vows and honeymoon in about 24 bars of music;
but she divorces him in a couple of lines at a backstage party. They part over
his refusal to stop producing hits and take a vacation. (I think.) It's hard
to care.;   The show was written for Joel Grey, and even Bernadette Peters
doesn't make much of a mark on the original-cast album. Clearly, the secondary
roles are very, very secondary. Danny Carroll and Maybin Hewes have the best
of them, as Cohan's parents.;   Gina Trano, who lit up "42nd Street" for CLO
in 1987, is a sweet, sassy Josie, but her part all but disappears in the
second act. Cohan's two wives are thankless roles, though Cornelia Whitcomb, a
head taller than feisty little Torcellini, makes the most of "20th-Century
Love"; and Leslie Becker is so bubbly as Agnes that she even makes "Yes, dear"
cute.;   All are suited and gowned to a fare-thee-well by costume designer B.
Modern (yes, that's her name). The men look like pre-World War I fashion
plates, from the Cohan men's dashing plaid pants to the ice-cream suits of a
natty barbershop quartet. And the women's clothes are sumptuous, from Mama
Cohan's emerald peau de soie to Ethel's royal blue divorce statement. The
chorus of 18 gets about 18 costume changes apiece. As for the patriotic
numbers, I haven't seen this much dazzling red, white and blue since the
Fourth of July display windows around Union Square.;   Bedizened Broadway;  
The only place Modern overdoes it is with Broadway star Fay Templeton. She
sings "Mary" -- whose lyrics ("There is something there/that sounds so
square") are a paean to simplicity -- in a gown with a glittering train and a
bodice inlaid with ribbon rosebuds. Moreover, Christine Wait, who plays the
diva, is immobilized by a lacquered wig and enough makeup to keep an
archaeologist employed. She is very much out of character with the rest of the
company, who have been beautifully wigged and made up by Robin Atlas.;   Set
designer Ken Holamon seems to have been waiting to do a backstage show, so
exuberant are his drop curtains, bunting and banners, marquee lights and
wedding-cake set for "Little Johnny Jones." The flats and drops move in and
out smoothly, doing their best to keep up the pace of the show, despite the
book's efforts to slow it down. The book won, but not before Holamon had given
it a good argument.;   Give my regards to glitz;   The Unintentional Humor
Award goes to the scene in which Cohan refuses to knuckle under to the Actors
Equity strike of 1919. Imagine, the nerve of those greedy, ungrateful
backstage bums, who rehearsed a mere 15 hours a day for the princely wage of
$15 a week!;   Nothing much has changed since then. Producers like Cohan still
beat their breasts and wail that a living wage for the actors will be the
death of theater. (Not to mention their profits.) This scene has got to be one
of the subtler digs in a show that otherwise exalts everything glitzy, smarmy,
slick, shallow and superficial about Broadway. In this, it's true to the life
and accomplishments of George M. Cohan.; George M!; Music and lyrics by George
