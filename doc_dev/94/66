Under the uncommunicative title of Very, Jonathan Burrows marks the debut of
his own Dance Group in the harsh world away from from the Royal Ballet.
Burrows is talented, of that there can be no doubt. From his earliest solos
more than a decade ago, he proposed an off-beat and unexpected view of
dancing. His recent pieces - especially rainy morning, cloudy, mild; Hymns
and Stoics - have revealed a dance language markedly original in its ability
to expose feeling, the sheer bloody awkwardness of life, and the distress
that lies just under the skin of social behaviour.
What then to make of the new Very which was seen at The Place at the week's
end. It is more 'difficult' and more hermetic than anything Burrows has
shown us before. I am tempted to call it Very Uncommunicative, because -
great admirer of Burrows though I am - I was puzzled by procedures that
seemed to me wilfully alienating. It would be foolish to ask for narrative
coherence - this is not Burrows' aim - but his earlier works spoke far more
allusively yet potently of relationships, of the difficulty of being.
Very takes place in an arena of light-bulbs at ground level; it involves
Burrows with two favoured dancers, Deborah Jones and Lynne Bristow, and the
composer Matteo Fargion. Fargion's accompaniment is a sequence of
banalities, sung and played from an electronic piano which is manoeuvered
over the dance area as part of the action. The text (largely inaudible)
sounds like extracts from an ancient English/Bulgarian phrase book. The
dance stresses similar banalities - crawling, stamping, fighting, slapping,
running, embracing - shown in deliberately raw fashion.
These are the elements of a human drama, the disjecta membra of emotion,
which Burrows offers to us as pieces of a jigsaw that we are (I imagine)
expected to put together. Or perhaps not. If Burrows' thesis is that life is
made up of mad and unrelated moments, of ceaseless brutality and fatuity, of
irrational breakdown and anguish, then to present it in a London theatre is
an act of supererogation. Life is even nastier outside, and even more
disjunct than this choreographic text. Of course, there are rewards: in the
bravura performances by the dancers, and - most exasperatingly - in the
hints of a larger shape, as Burrows and Lynne Bristow play to each other
throughout the piece like a couple trapped in a relationship.
In ducking away from meaning, Burrows is true to his choreographic process,
but I think he betrays his material by making it so difficult to assess, so
cussed. It is as if, like the exquisitely tiresome Judson Church
experimentalists in New York 30 years ago, he is re-inventing theatrical
movement from its most ordinary elements, and purging dance drama of its
conventions. Ultimately, Very is a meal where we are given the ingredients
rather than the finished dish. Unsatisfying. Very.
