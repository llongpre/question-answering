   A pocket-sized spray version of cayenne pepper is
being used by growing numbers of police agencies to temporarily
disable drunks, drug addicts and snarling dogs, the device's
manufacturer says.
   Gardner Whitcomb, owner of Cap-Stun Inc., said his company's
sales have quadrupled this year to more than $1 million.
   More than 1,000 police agencies have switched from mace to
Cap-Stun since the FBI decided to switch to the pepper spray last
fall, The Denver Post reported today.
   Women concerned about a 57 percent surge in rapes in the Denver
area over the past year also are turning to Cap-Stun. But some
Denver police officials have doubts about its effectiveness.
   ``Unless it hits you right in the open eyes, it takes too long to
incapacitate you,'' said Sgt. Dave Abrams, supervisor of the Denver
Police Department's SWAT team. ``I've seen it take more than a
minute.''
   Whitcomb said Denver police spray at too close a range to allow
formation of a mist that can be inhaled.
   A Maryland chemist developed the spray 20 years ago when his
wife, summoned to court to testify about a holdup she witnessed,
wanted nonlethal protection against thugs who threatened her life.
   Cap-Stun is supposed to stop dogs and intoxicated or drugged
criminals, who often are unaffected or angered by mace. The pepper
attacks membranes inside the nose.
   The spray does not have lasting effects, promising reduced
brutality charges against police.
