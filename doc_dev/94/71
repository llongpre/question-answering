   Judson R. Branch, former chairman of the Allstate
Insurance Co., has died after a long illness at age 82.
   Branch, who died Monday, spent 38 years with Allstate. As one of
the company's first agents, he helped establish the revolutionary
merchandising idea of selling insurance over the counter at Sears,
Roebuck and Co. stores. Sears owns the insurance giant.
   He was elected president and chief executive officer of the
company in 1957, and became chairman of the board in 1966.
