TITANS' MURPHY FINALIST FOR JOB AT SAN JOSE STATE

Gene Murphy, who has been interviewed for a number of jobs during his 10-year 
tenure as Cal State Fullerton's football coach, is one of three finalists for 
the vacant head coaching position at San Jose State, according to Spartan 
assistant Rick Rasnick. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick, the team's offensive coordinator who also is a finalist, confirmed 
that Murphy interviewed at the school last Friday and is a candidate along with 
California offensive coordinator Terry Shea. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was a finalist for the Nevada Las Vegas job this past winter, 
refused to comment on the San Jose State position and would not confirm that he 
had interviewed there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say a word about it, and that's all I'm going to say," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick said Wednesday that he expects the school to make a decision today, 
Friday or early next week. Among the other candidates interviewed were former 
Detroit Lions coach Darryl Rogers, who coached the Spartans from 1976-78, Rams 
assistant Artie Gigantino and Penn State assistant Ron Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
The four-man screening committee that interviewed candidates includes athletic 
director Randy Hoffman, junior defensive back Hesh Colar; Dan Buerger, 
executive assistant to the school president, and Dr. Charles Whitcomb, the 
school's faculty representative to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't given me any time frame, but I think it's going to happen 
quickly," Rasnick said. "They've interviewed everyone, talked to everyone, and 
I think they're close to making a decision." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News quoted Colar this week as saying the three candidates 
are "all pretty even with a little more emphasis on Murphy and Shea. . . . The 
players like Rasnick. The only concern with the committee is his lack of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Colar then told the Mercury News Wednesday that the committee had pared its 
list to Murphy and Shea, but Rasnick said Wednesday night that he had not been 
notified of such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick and Shea said they have not been offered the job or been told they 
weren't going to receive offers. 
</P>
<P>
One potential stumbling block for Murphy may be that, according to Rasnick, a 
new coach wouldn't be able to hire assistants from the outside until next 
December. The six current Spartan assistants are on contract through the 1990 
season, and the school cannot afford to pay two staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that would be unappealing to someone coming in from the outside, 
but you never know," Rasnick said. "The whole timing of this has been unique 
and has created some confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Shea, who was the offensive coordinator at San Jose State from 1984-86, said 
the staff situation wouldn't deter him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached with about half the guys who are there now, and I would feel 
comfortable with the ones I know," Shea said. "I'm prepared to handle that." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose State job opened up when six-year coach Claude Gilbert was fired 
on March 21. The administration listed minor NCAA rules violations, a low 
graduation rate among football players and differences in recruiting 
philosophies as reasons for dismissing Gilbert, who last week filed a wrongful 
termination grievance with the university. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has earned praise for building a competitive program despite the 
Titans' meager budget and lack of an on-campus stadium, has a 54-60-1 record 
and has won two conference championships, in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He was a finalist for the UNLV position last December, but the job went to 
former Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong. Murphy also met with Utah Athletic 
Director Chris Hill about the position there, but was not formally interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was in demand in 1984, after the Titans went 11-1. He was offered the 
vacant job at Utah that year, and withdrew from consideration at Oregon State 
at the leading candidate. He chose to pursue the Missouri job, but the job went 
to Woody Widenhofer. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murphy, the coach's son who is a sophomore at Fullerton, said he's not 
sure his father would accept the job if it is offered. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be like all the other job offers, when he says, 'Oh, well, I think 
I'll just stay here,' " the younger Murphy said. "I know he's talked to them 
(San Jose State officials), but he hasn't told me anything else. I have a 
feeling he'll be here next season."
