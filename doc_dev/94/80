   Yoko Ono, resurrecting one of the interactive
art works she displayed at the London show where she met John
Lennon, unveiled ``Painting to Hammer a Nail In 1961-1990'' at a
church on Friday.
   ``For me, this piece has worked as a kind of atonement, to start
a new decade with a clearer vision, and to replace my reverence for
the abstract with that of life,'' Ono said in a statement. ``I
dedicate this piece to all martyrs in the history of the earth.''
   The artwork, on display for the next year at the Judson Memorial
Church in Manhattan, allows visitors to pound a nail into a
cross-shaped piece of wood. One of its earlier incarnations was on
display at the 1966 show where she and Lennon met.
   The display is part of the 100th anniversary of the church. The
church's senior minister, Howard Moody, said the church was ``proud
to host this work of art which is a symbol of resistance to every
from of artistic tyranny by church and state.''
   Lennon and Ono were married for 11 years until he was murdered
outside their Manhattan apartment in 1980.
