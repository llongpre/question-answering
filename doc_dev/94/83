SUMMER STUDENTS SPARK TO 'JUMP-START'

<P>
After years of desultory and limited remedial offerings that failed to turn on 
students and teachers, new excitement is stirring in summer schools across San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 sixth- and seventh-graders in Donna Somerville's enrichment class at 
Memorial Junior High School have talked with a space-station designer, went 
behind the scenes at the zoo, used microscopes to explore the structure of 
cells, and written dialogue for a play on Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville's students are among 350 scattered throughout nine elementary and 
secondary schools in Southeast San Diego who are participating in a new magnet 
enrichment program. The program is made possible through a federal, multi-year 
grant awarded to the city school district. 
</P>
<P>
The 33 or so first-graders assigned to Lois Jacobs' class at Field Elementary 
in Clairemont for extra reading help don't know that they're part of a new 
district effort to try to make remediation -- long the staple of summer school 
instruction -- pay off better when the students return to classes this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and her aide, Kathy Tronerud, both from Fremont Elementary, are using 
new literature books, "magic circle" groupings of children working with other 
children, storyboard drawings and a host of other new curriculum offerings to 
"jump-start" the academic performance of these students, all of whom have been 
judged to be at risk of falling behind their peers even at their early age. 
</P>
<P>
No longer are the several thousand elementary students who need more work in 
basic skills being asked to use the same textbooks and teaching style that 
proved lacking in getting them adequately prepared the first time. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the innovations in the skills classes are happening largely at the 
elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
Junior- and senior-high students needing to repeat a course to make up a 
failing grade still receive the same material during a concentrated four-hour, 
six-week period that leaves creativity and changes in teaching styles up to the 
individual teacher. 
</P>
<P>
District educators believe that the changes already made -- as well as others 
anticipated in the future -- can only improve long-term academics. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Stevens, who oversees the regular summer school program for the San Diego 
Unified School District, says that making summer school "fun" will increase 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
The element of fun is central to the enrichment classes, which are being 
offered for the first time in almost a decade. Until this summer, parents 
interested in having their children receive such instruction had only the 
private Gateways program in University City as an option. 
</P>
<P>
Program coordinator Carolanne Buguey said there are 350 students, about the 
maximum allowed under the funding, about equally divided between elementary and 
secondary levels. Any student at a magnet city school -- a school with special 
curriculum designed to promote integration by attracting students from outside 
the immediate neighborhood -- was eligible to apply. Most of the secondary 
students who are participating signed up for a course to prepare for college 
entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
At Oak Park Elementary, teacher Peggy Araiza has organized her six-week program 
around an "animal kingdom" theme, drawing in elements of science, literature, 
writing and fine arts as a way to expose her 20 students to new ideas and 
experiences, as well as strengthening their writing, reading and math skills. 
</P>
<P>
Her aide, Monica Pernell, a Serra High School senior who is part of a 
future-teachers program, said that the enrichment class is "a real eye opener. 
These kids have so much going on that they don't have time to sit around and 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, each day the students launch enthusiastically into a 10-minute chorus 
of poems and songs, ranging from "Little Orphan Annie" by James Whitcomb Riley, 
to the Gettysburg Address of Abraham Lincoln, and the "I Have a Dream" speech 
of Martin Luther King Jr., as soon as they finish the morning Pledge of 
Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
"All the students have varied interests and you have to stay on top of each 
individual child" to get the maximum result, Araiza said. "For some, you have 
to prepare them for enrichment, dangle a lot of carrots in front of them, like 
the chance to do calligraphy, to pick out a special book, and by doing so, 
boost their attitudes so that they'll then sit down with their times 
(multiplication) tables and work on that as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important (at this age) because many are getting ready for middle 
school . . . I want to have as much impact on their lives as possible, to give 
them as many tools for leaning as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Memorial's Somerville had her students preparing reports on animals last week 
in anticipation of their visit to the zoo. Each read their report orally in 
front of a video camera as preparation for performing a play in front of an 
audience later in the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to bond, to have better self-esteem, to have positive peer 
pressure for achievement, to make this summer count so that it will make a 
difference in their lives," said Somerville, a resource teacher during the 
regular year at Memorial, an oasis of learning in the midst of one of the 
toughest barrios in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Somerville worries that some of the students could eventually succumb to the 
barrio pressure to not do well in school, especially as they move into the 
secondary years. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, she is exhilarated about the summer class. 
</P>
<P>
In general, while the enrichment classes have no more than 20 students, the 
regular summer classes can range from 25 students to almost 40, making the 
"jump start" effort of teachers even more difficult because it limits the 
personal attention they can give students. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens hopes that the new literature-based curriculum written especially 
for summer-school use and which emphasizes hands-on learning, will address more 
of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that if we did something different to promote fun, not fun and 
games, but excitement about learning, we might short-circuit some of the 
failure syndrome that these kids otherwise get into," said Pat Meredith, a 
resource teacher who helped write some of the summer-school literature lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy. We realize that there are skills these children need and they 
haven't learned them well enough the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs would readily agree. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the district's stellar teachers, Jacobs sometimes feels she 
has moved mountains at the end of the four-hour summer instructional day. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students still struggle to read basic sentences, and their previous 
lack of success leads quickly into short attention spans and horseplay as 
Jacobs cajoles them to think about "Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile," the book they are 
reading together. 
</P>
<P>
She has the students talk together about crocodiles, to write a word or two 
about their own feelings toward the animal, to play around with paper strips of 
sentences to try to arrange them in the order of a story. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad because for some of these kids, learning has no meaning and school is 
anything but fun," said Tronerud, Jacobs' aide. "Some of these kids already 
feel they are failures, but they don't have to be." 
</P>
<P>
To help turn around their attitudes, Jacobs cooks for the students each Friday, 
showing them how to use their arithmetic to measure weights and liquids in 
making brownies or fruit cocktails or homemade ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they are picking up some vocabulary," Jacobs said. "The new 
(literature) curriculum has made a difference" compared to controlled-word 
reading texts traditionally used in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum, which emphasizes writing and literature discussions 
especially at the upper elementary grades, has made Sheila Barron's task much 
easier with her fourth- and fifth-graders at Lee Elementary in Paradise Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a big library, we have bought a lot of new books, we are working to 
get kids to see reading not as a task but as a joy," Barron said. To that end, 
she constantly throws out ideas and observations to the students, asking them 
to think about how they might change the plot, encouraging them to write a 
letter to one of the story's characters, to speculate on where the next 
chapters of the novel might take the plot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the student seem to be more interested" than they are in the 
traditional textbooks, Barron said. "There actually does seem to be a lot of 
thinking and listening going on."
