WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
WAITING PERIOD FOR RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who buy rifles in Santa Monica will have to wait 15 days to take 
delivery of their weapons starting next year, under a law adopted by the City 
Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
Because state law prohibits municipalities from imposing waiting periods on gun 
purchasers for the purpose of making background checks on them, the new Santa 
Monica law defines the 15-day wait as a cooling-off period in which no 
background checks will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed the effective date of the law to next Jan. 1 on the advice 
of City Atty. Robert Myers, who said it gives time to state legislators to 
adopt similar, overriding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Local gun shop owners doubted the effectiveness of such a plan. Judson 
Swearingen, owner of Cole's Guns, said the law would "divert the legitimate 
purchases by Santa Monica residents to stores outside this city." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman David Finkel said the waiting period would "advance the dialogue 
(on gun control). If it does nothing more than that, then it's still a good 
idea," he said.
