   Sen. Dan Quayle conceded today that a
portion of his resume indicating he spent two years as the chief
consumer investigator for the Indiana Attorney General's office is
``inaccurate.''
   Quayle said he did not know how the error occurred, but that his
staff was responsible for putting together his resume.
   Quayle's official Senate biography states that from 1970 to
1971, he was the ``chief investigator'' for the Consumer Protection
Division of the Indiana Attorney General's office.
   But The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported today that Quayle
actually held that position for only two and one-half months.
   ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold that
job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
   He acknowledged that he held the job for ``several months'' but
said he did not have ``an exact time frame.''
   The paper said he was an entry-level research assistant for most
of his time in the office.
   Earlier, Quayle press secretary David Prosperi called the
newspaper report ``a cheap shot'' and said, ``He held the office.
He worked his way up to that position and that's that.''
   Prosperi said he was not sure how many months Quayle had held
the consumer protection job, but added, ``The important point is
that he held the job. He didn't make it up.''
   The Plain Dealer said the consumer protection division didn't
even exist in 1970, and Quayle had already gone to work in the
governor's office when it was officially opened.
   ``He just helped set it up,'' said Robert E. Lybrook, a
Martinsville, Ind., lawyer who became the chief investigator when
the division officially opened for business in September 1971.
   ``He wasn't chief of anything when he went over there,'' added
M. Stanton Evans, a former editor at the Indianapolis News who
arranged Quayle's job interview with then-Attorney General Theodore
L. Sendak.
   The Plain Dealer said state records show that Quayle went to
work in the attorney general's office as a ``legal assistant'' in
January 1970. It said the job is similar to that of a law clerk and
involved drafting memoranda, performing research and writing
letters.
   The newspaper said Quayle held the investigator's job for 2{
months but that state records show he already was working for
then-Gov. Edgar Whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the
consumer division was officially launched.
   Quayle had completed campaigning for the day when the Plain
Dealer story appeared and neither he nor his aides were immediately
available to comment.
   Quayle's campaign moves west today to Montana, Utah and
California.
   Quayle's claim to have been chief investigator is contained in
his Senate biography, which is being distributed as official
background by the Republican campaign.
   The latest disclosures came just as Quayle and Republican
presidential nominee George Bush were seeing a week-long dispute
about Quayle's military record begin to dissipate.
   During his campaign appearances Thursday, Quayle aimed his pitch
at farmers in Missouri and South Dakota.
   In stops at state fairs in both states, Quayle met with farmers
and told them: ``Don't let anybody ever tell you that America is
not still dependent on agriculture and the farmers for our quality
of life.''
   He called the trade bill signed into law recently and whose
principal architect was his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, ``a good first step to send a message that we are very
serious about trade,'' but promised stronger farm legislation next
year to enhance exports and make agricultural goods more
competitive.
   Quayle was asked in press encounters about his vote last month
against establishing a Cabinet-level position for the Veterans
Administration.
   Quayle on Monday told a veterans group his vote on the VA issue
was a ``youthful indiscretion,'' but he said at a news conference
Thursday in Boonville, Mo. that he did not regret his vote.
   But his comments seemed to leave room for doubt as to whether he
thought the vote was a mistake: ``Perhaps my vote was not the right
vote. I still think it's the right vote and I stand by my record.''
   Bentsen suggested Wednesday that Quayle is not mature enough to
be in a job a heartbeat away from the presidency.
   ``I am qualified, if that situation arises,'' Quayle said,
adding that he is an expert on national defense and security issues.
   He called this year's drought-relief package ``a good bill''
that he voted for, but did not respond to questions about why he
opposed some drought relief measures in earlier years. ``I stand on
my record,'' he said, when asked about the earlier votes.
   Quayle's candidacy has been dogged by questions about whether he
pulled strings to avoid the draft and enter the National Guard
during the Vietnam War. He has denied using any ``undue influence.''
   Quayle's aides insisted that the draft controversy had faded.
   The candidate was greeted in Columbia by a contingent of
supporters, but some opponents in the crowd chanted ``Quayle's a
chicken'' and others displayed signs reading ``Sissy Rich Boy,''
``Dump Quayle'' and ``War Wimp.''
