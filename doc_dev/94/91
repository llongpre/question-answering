KELL MAKES APPOINTMENTS TO 3 CIVIC COMMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell has reappointed one member of the Long Beach Harbor Commission 
and extended the term of another, keeping the five-member panel intact for at 
least another year. 
</P>
<P>
Kell announced this week that he would not replace Commissioner Louise DuVall, 
an attorney, citing the need to "maintain the direction and stability of the 
port." Instead, she will remain in her spot for about another year before any 
change is considered again, Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
DuVall, who has been on the commission since 1979, will serve as its president 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week approved the mayor's reappointment of David L. 
Hauser, a real estate agent, to a second six-year term on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also gave the go-ahead to new appointments to the city's 
Redevelopment Agency board and Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Physician Judson R. Schoendorf and James R. Kennelly were appointed to 
four-year terms on the Redevelopment Agency board, which has five members. They 
replace Thomas E. Stewart, whose second term ended in May, and Msgr. Ernest 
Gualderon, whose second term officially ended in 1987 but was extended another 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Dentist Ebenezer Bush will serve a four-year term on the seven-member Planning 
Commission. He replaces Dr. Horace Rains, who served two terms.
