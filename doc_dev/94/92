   Cindy Pickett, who portrays the mother of a
California boy who was abducted at age 7, says the boy's real
mother never abandoned hope during the seven years her son was held
by his abductor.
   A new NBC miniseries tells the story of Steven Stayner, who was
kidnapped from his home in Merced, Calif., in 1972 and held captive
until he was able to escape in 1979. During those seven years he
lived an apparently normal life as the son of his abductor, Kenneth
Parnell, a convicted child molester.
   But Steven's parents never gave up hope of finding him alive.
   ``She said she knew Steven wasn't dead because a mother would
know,'' says Pickett, who portrays Kay Stayner, the mother, in ``I
Know My First Name is Steven.''
   The two-part miniseries, which will be televised on Monday and
Tuesday, also stars John Ashton as the father, Del Stayner, Arliss
Howard as Parnell, Corin ``Corky'' Nemec as the teen-age Steven and
Luke Edwards as the 7-year-old Steven.
   Larry Ellikan directed. J.P. Miller and Cynthia Whitcomb adapted
the screenplay from a story by J.P. Miller.
   Parnell told Steven that his parents didn't want him any more.
   ``The boy thought he haof off-Broadway's most
innovative theaters, particularly as a home for plays that deserve
a second chance.
   From its beginnings in an Upper West Side hotel, where audiences
had to cross a drug-infested Columbus Avenue to get to the theater,
to its current space in a gentrified area of shops, restaurants and
co-ops on Upper Broadway, Second Stage has made its mark.
   During that decade, its commitment to re-evaluating plays like
Lanford Wilson's ``Serenading Louie,'' Jules Feiffer's ``Little
Murders'' and ``The Woods'' by David Mamet hasn't waivered. Yet the
theater's vision has altered slightly.
   ``We've evolved,'' explains Miss Goodman, a one-time actress who
gave up acting for fund raising and administration. ``When we came
on the scene, we fulfilled a need that wasn't present off-Broadway.
Everyone was doing new plays. No one was doing contemporary plays a
second time.''
   Things have changed. Today, from Lincoln Center to the New York
Shakespeare Festival to the Humana Festival for New American Plays
in Louisville, Ky., theater companies offer playwrights second
productions.
   ``We also did plays that maybe hadn't been done in New York
before, like `How I Got That Story' or `My Sister in This House,'
'' Miss Rothman says. ``They had been done in other theaters around
the country but not here, so they seemed like new plays.''
   The women were diligent in their search for properties, reading
scripts, doing library research, reading reviews and meeting with
every artistic director in New York to ask them, ``If you could do
a play again that you did in the past, what would it be?''
   The women spent a year raising money _ $90,000 _ and planning a
three-play season before the theater finally opened in 1979.
   ``We did that so we could just concentrate on the plays,'' Miss
Goodman recalls. ``We thought we were pretty smart. Ten days before
we were supposed to start the first play, nearly everybody quit _
the director, the lighting designer, the set designer _ and the two
lead actors walked out along with them.''
   Miss Rothman took over the direction of the play. Miss Goodman
took over all its technical aspects, and both begged two actor
friends to come in and save them. They did. The play didn't get
great reviews, but it and the theater survived even if audiences
had to take an elevator to the shabby building's top floor to see
the shows.
   ``If you lived to get to the 16th floor, you were happy to see
anything,'' Miss Goodman says.
   Among the works presented that first season was a revival of
Michael Weller's ``Split.'' Weller has been a mainstay of Second
Stage. He was the focus of the Second Stage's last season when it
presented two old Weller plays, ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose
Ends,'' as well as the world premiere of ``Spoils of War,'' a new
Weller work starring Kate Nelligan that later went to Broadway.
   It wasn't until the theater's third season that it attempted a
new play. The premiere was ``Pastorale'' by Deborah Eisenberg.
   ``The reason we did it was because it had been rejected by
everybody in and outside New York,'' Miss Goodman says. ``We read
the play and fell in love with it. She wasn't going to get a
production unless we did it.''
   The following season, a subscriber and playwright named Tina
Howe came to them with ``Painting Churches,'' a play already turned
down by the New York Shakespeare Festival.
   The duo decided to do it. The play was a success and transferred
to the Lamb's Theater near Times Square for an extended run.
   ``As we began to see we were making our mark, proving our point
and had good relationships with playwrights, it seemed silly for
them, if we had a good working experience, to take their new play
somewhere else,'' Miss Goodman says.
   The relationship with Miss Howe has continued through the years.
   In 1986, the theater presented the playwright's next work,
``Coastal Disturbances,'' which also went on to Broadway and
received another best play Tony nomination.
   The relationship has continued with ``Approaching Zanzibar,''
Miss Howe's latest work, currently enjoying a run at Second Stage.
The play, which stars Jane Alexander and Harris Yulin, looks at a
family as it travels across the country to visit a dying aunt.
   Miss Rothman has directed the play, something she tries to do at
least once each season. Her partner used to act in one play a year,
but after the first four years, gave it up.
   ``It was painful to be acting in my own theater,'' Miss Goodman
says. ``That's a lot of responsibility. Every once in a while, I
say `Hey, I could do this part.' But then I say to Carole,
`Wouldn't Judith Ivey or Diane Wiest be good in this role?'''
   Second Stage moved into its modern, 120-seat theater, christened
the Walter McGinn@John Cazale Theater, in 1984. It was named for
actor Walter McGinn, Miss Goodman's husband, who was killed in an
automobile accident in 1977, and a good friend of his, John Cazale,
another actor, who died of cancer the following year.
   Today, the theater has an annual budget of more than $2 million
for its four-play season, and shows no sign of being a victim of
its increasing success.
   ``Our mutual strength is that we have the same taste in plays,''
says Miss Rothman. ``We usually agree on things.
   ``Robin is incredibly giving to a production,'' she adds. ``Even
if a play doesn't get great reviews, she'll still be in there,
talking to people. Just making sure that the experience of working
here is a positive one. We're not here to make a lot of money, so
you should get some joy out of the experience.''
