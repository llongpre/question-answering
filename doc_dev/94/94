FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Democratic credentials in South
Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's assessment of the South African scene displayed some
familiarity with the subject. But his lofty assertion that the newly formed
Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner
Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats
cannot pass without comment.
I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art,
western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa
correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and
political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic
organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party
alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which
of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had
the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism.
Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing
'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe
Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or
President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They
are both good public relations men, not democrats.
