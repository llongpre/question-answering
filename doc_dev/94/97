   A car carrying a family to a Christmas Eve
celebration swerved into the path of a dump truck, killing seven
people and scattering presents across the road, authorities said.
   None of the seven victims was wearing a seat belt when the
accident occurred Saturday, but the force of the impact was so
great, belts probably wouldn't have saved their lives anyway,
according to Starke County Coroner Douglas E. O'Donnell.
   ``From my observation, there was no way to help any of them,'' he
said.
   ``This has got to be one of the most tragic traffic accidents
ever in Starke County,'' he said. ``It's been a real tragic year for
a small county like ours. It's bad enough to have a tragedy like
this, let alone on a holiday, and with a whole family (killed), it
is pretty bad.''
   Six members of the Davis family of Knox and the girlfriend of one
of the six were pronounced dead at the scene. Their car veered into
the path of the dump truck when they tried to avoid a car that had
slowed down to make a turn, authorities said. The driver of the
truck received minor injuries.
   Weather was not believed to be a factor in the crash, authorities
said.
   The victims were identified as Floyd Davis, 25, the driver of the
car; Rosalind Davis, 24, his wife; Jesse Davis, 17, his brother;
Gloria Davis, 46, his mother; Crystal Davis, 6, and Carl James
Davis, 3, his stepchildren; and Laura Cites, 25, Jesse Davis'
girlfriend.
   O'Donnell said the family was headed to a celebration at a
relative's home near North Judson, and several Christmas presents
were scattered throughout the crash site southwest of Knox.
