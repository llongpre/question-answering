  [Text] Immediately after the official ceremony held at the 
Presidential Palace in Hanoi to welcome visiting Australian 
Prime Minister Paul Keating, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
expressed his delight in welcoming his Australian counterpart in 
Vietnam, considering this a new development in the relations of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet wished Prime Minister Paul Keating success 
in his visit, thereby significantly contributing to 
strengthening the Vietnam-Australia relations. 
  In his reply, Prime Minister Paul Keating said: Vietnam has 
scored new, significant progress in various aspects, and I wish 
to see this during my visit. On this basis, the Australian 
Government will find ways and means to help Vietnam to develop 
its economy and participate in other activities in the region. 
We understand the significance of this historical visit, and we 
will do our best to strengthen the relations of friendship and 
cooperation between our two nations. 
  Dear friends, this morning the SRV Government delegation, 
led 
by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, held talks with the Australian 
Government delegation led by Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  At the talks, both sides informed each other of the 
situation 
in their respective countries and about issues of mutual 
concern, reviewed cooperation during the past period, and 
frankly exchanged views on various issues aimed at improving 
Vietnam-Australia cooperation. 
  This afternoon, Prime Minister Paul Keating and his 
entourage 
visited the Central Institute of Ophthalmology and the ANZ Bank 
in Hanoi. The same afternoon, SRV President Le Duc Anh 
cordially received Prime Minister Paul Keating and the 
Australian distinguished guests.
