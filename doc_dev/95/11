  [Text] Dear friends: Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating will pay his first official friendship to our country at 
the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. In today's issue, 
NHAN DAN carries an editorial pegged to this event entitled: In 
the Interests of the Vietnamese and Australian Peoples and for 
the Sake of Peace, Cooperation, and Development. The editorial 
reads in part as follows: 
  Following the first official visit to Australia by our prime 
minister in May 1993, the Vietnam visit by Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating has drawn the attention of broad sections 
of public opinion in the region and other parts of the world. 
This important event marks a new developmental step in the 
friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Australia. 
  Vietnam and Australia established diplomatic relations in 
1973. The friendly and cooperative ties between the two 
countries have continued to develop with each passing day since 
then based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual 
understanding, equality, and mutual benefit. Australia highly 
valued Vietnam's renovation achievements in all fields as well 
as Vietnam's foreign policy of diversification and 
multilateralization and its efforts to improve relations with 
many countries in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  Australia lifted its trade embargo at an early date and 
resumed its development aid for Vietnam. It has also shared its 
experiences and stepped up cooperation with Vietnam. The 
cooperative ties between the two countries have been improved 
step by step. Both sides have worked together toward the goals 
of implementing agreements on economic and trade cooperation, 
thereby creating favorable conditions for increasing the value 
of bilateral trade activities to $70 million in 1991 from $2 
million in 1982 and to $252 million in 1992 and then to $366 
million in 1993. Australia has become Vietnam's seventh trade 
partner and ranks fifth on the list of foreign investors in 
Vietnam with 26 projects valued at $776 million. 
  Australia has also helped our country with the training of 
hundreds of specialists; the formulation of laws on mining, 
telecommunications, and state management over 
telecommunications; and the enhancement of farmland irrigation, 
hydrometeorological, public health, and tourist sectors in which 
Vietnam has a need and Australia has great potential and high 
technologies. 
  Regarding many regional and international issues, Vietnam 
and 
Australia have reached more and more consensus on the need for 
peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region 
that the two countries have regarded as the top priority 
objectives of their foreign policies. 
  We hope that Prime Minister Paul Keating's official 
friendship visit to Vietnam will end in success, help strengthen 
mutual understanding, and lead the multifaceted cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia to a higher level, a larger scale, 
and a broader scope for the sake of each country's prosperity 
and in conformity with the common trends of peace, cooperation, 
and development in the Asia-Pacific region.
