  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has 
arrived in Vietnam for last stop on an Asian tour which has also 
included Laos and Thailand. Mr. Keating is the first Australian 
leader to visit Hanoi. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top 
Vietnamese leaders including President Le Duc Anh, the Communist 
Party General Secretary Doi Muoi, and the Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  Australian officials say Mr. Keating will take a low-key 
approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong 
statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian 
parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese 
officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian 
parliamentary human rights delegation to visit Vietnam later 
this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on 
expanding economic links with Vietnam. Australia is currently 
the third largest investor in Vietnam taking $620 million 
[currency not further specified], mostly for oil and 
telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth 
$366 million with Vietnam running up a $136 million surplus 
through crude oil sales to Australia. 
  Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating has spent his first 
afternoon in Vietnam sightseeing in Hanoi. The formal part of 
the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome 
before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well 
reports Mr. Keating's main purpose in going to Vietnam is to 
assess the potential for economic development and what further 
role Australia can play. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says Vietnam has a 
great opportunity to develop and he believes Australia can help 
make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social 
policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change 
his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the Vietnam 
War, Mr. Keating said he does not discriminate in commemorating 
Australia's war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at 
the opening of the Vietnam Memorial in Canberra. 
  [Keating in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in 
Australia and the same belief in our values as every other 
service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But 
again.... This in Hanoi and, really, in places I am visiting 
there is no natural opportunity as there was in Thailand. [end
