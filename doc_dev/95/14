  [Text] The visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating 
has left Hanoi for Ho Chi Minh City, continuing his official 
visit to Vietnam. He was seen off by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who conveyed him greetings from Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  Speaking to Mr. Cam, Mr. Keating expressed pleasure at his 
Vietnam visit. His meetings with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
President Le Duc Anh have contributed to better mutual 
understanding and promotion of bilateral ties. He showed 
concern for the development of Vietnam in general and Hanoi, in 
particular. 
  Besides doubling its development assistance to Vietnam in 
the 
coming four years, Australia will provide Hanoi with a separate 
aid package for preservation of Hanoi's historical areas. 
  Mr. Keating highly valued Vietnam's role in the region and 
wished that Vietnam will increase its cooperation with Australia 
to promote development and peace in Asia and the Pacific.
