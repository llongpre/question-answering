<F P=106> [Editorial from 5 April PASASON: "Wholeheartedly Salute and </F>
Welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government Delegation"] 
  [Text] In response to an invitation from His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of 
the Commonwealth of Australia, will lead a Commonwealth of 
Australia Government delegation on an official, friendly visit 
to the LPDR on 5 April. The multiethnic Lao people throughout 
the country -- elated at this event, which is significant in 
Lao-Australian relations -- feel greatly honored to have the 
opportunity to welcome the Commonwealth of Australia Government 
delegation. 
  This official, friendly visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
follows the official, friendly visit to the Commonwealth of 
Australia by H.E. Khamtai Siphandon in mid-December 1993. The 
visit is considered a new and significant event since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 
over four decades ago. This visit to the LPDR by the prime 
minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and his delegation 
reflects the Australian people's good friendship with the 
multiethnic Lao people. It is also considered a very 
significant event in the history of relations between the two 
countries. It will, therefore, serve as a firm basis for 
strengthening friendly relations and cooperation effectively in 
the immediate and long terms in the interest of the peoples of 
Laos and Australia, thus contributing to the common trend for 
the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship, 
and cooperation among various countries in this region and the 
rest of the world. 
  Laos and Australia have maintained good relations for a long 
time. Over the past 10 years or so, the two sides have made 
efforts to promote relations in various fields. It is 
noteworthy that following the visit to Australia by H.E. Prime 
Minister Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Australian relations have 
developed ever more extensively and rapidly. On this occasion, 
the multiethnic Lao people would like to express their profound 
gratitude to the Australian Government and people for the 
significant support and assistance they have rendered to the Lao 
Government and people in building and developing the LPDR's 
economy and society, especially in building the communications 
infrastructure, training technicians in various branches, and 
developing communities. The assistance in the construction of 
the Friendship Bridge, which serves as a good token of the 
friendly relations and fruitful cooperation between Laos and 
Australia, is noteworthy. 
  We wish H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth 
of Australia, and his party glorious success in this official, 
friendly visit to the LPDR. Its success which will contribute 
to further promoting and expanding relations and cooperation 
between the two countries ever more fruitfully for the benefit 
of the peoples of Laos and Australia.
