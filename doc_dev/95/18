<F P=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his 
way home after a three-nation tour of Asia. Mr. Keating's trip 
took him to Laos, Thailand, and finally Vietnam, where he 
invited the communist party leader, Do Muoi, to visit Australia. 
It's an invitation the Vietnamese leader accepted and this is 
sure to cause unhappiness among some of the Vietnamese who fled 
their country after the communist's victory in 1975 and now live 
in Australia. Christopher Kremmer reports from Hanoi that Mr. Do 
Muoi will be seen as a more provocative figure than the 
reformist prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, whose presence in 
Australia last year led to demonstrations by Australian 
Vietnamese. 
  [Begin Kremmer recording] It's the oldest rule of war -- 
both 
sides on two-fronts -- and Mr. Keating has broken it. His 
invitation to communist party chief Do Muoi proved alienating an 
important lobby group, which so far has remained relatively 
quiet about his visit to Vietnam. The invitation was issued 
during what one official described as unusually long and 
interesting talks between Mr. Keating and the 76-year-old party 
leader in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday. The VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY 
later reported that it has been accepted by Do Muoi with 
pleasure. As the party chief has in recent months been visiting 
neighboring ASEAN countries, an invitation to come to Australia 
was unexpected. Even a reformist leader like Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet attracted the wrath of a small section of the 
Vietnamese community when he visited Australia last year. But 
Do Muoi, head of the party which maintains armed [word 
indistinct] party-rule over Vietnam is an entirely different 
matter. He represents to some Australian Vietnamese a painful 
reminder of a war which did so much damage and deprecation to 
their lives. And as Vietnam [word indistinct], that it was not 
just the allies who were responsible for atrocities in the war. 
Terror was a weapon used by both sides to polarize communities 
and keep villagers on side. A communist party government is 
still accused by Asia Watch and other human right and religious 
groups of serious infringements of civil liberties and political 
rights. Above all the right of the people to choose their 
government at free election. As one commentator remarked 
recently a great deal of history stands between Vietnam and 
United States. The same could be said of Vietnam and Australia. 
The commentator went on to observe that while communism may be 
dead in Vietnam, authoritarianism is thriving. That affects the 
relatives of Australian Vietnamese still living here. Do Muoi's 
communist party is seen by some as bearing most responsibility. 
Mr. Keating has observed that the wounds of war are still deep 
in Vietnam, but the wounds are also deeply felt by Vietnamese 
who fled their homeland for Australia and many of them are 
unlikely to be impressed by the invitation. [end recording]
