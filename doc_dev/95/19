  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hosted a banquet in 
honor of visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, his 
wife, and his delegation at Government House yesterday evening. 
The Australian prime minister and his entourage are currently 
on an official visit to Thailand as guests of the Thai 
Government. 
  In a welcome speech delivered at the banquet, Prime Minister 
Chuan said that the meeting between the Thai and Australian 
delegations during the visit will provide a good opportunity for 
both sides to develop their existing friendship, create better 
understanding, and expand cooperation between the two countries 
in the exploitation of their energy and potentials. The meeting 
will also enable both sides to find ways to enhance their roles 
in increasing the regional dynamic and collaboration. In 
addition, the prime minister expressed his admiration for 
Australia's constructive role in the Southeast Asian and 
Asia-Pacific regions. Australian participation in the opening 
of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge is an historic event that 
reflects a great achievement resulting from international 
cooperation. Australia is thereby considered to have a role in 
the process of establishing peace and progress in Southeast Asia.
