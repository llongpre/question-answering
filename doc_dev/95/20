  [Text] Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and Prime 
Minister Paul Keating of Australia visited Vietnam in the first 
fortnight of April. Here is our review of these visits: 
  The two prime ministers came to Vietnam with a view to 
broaden cooperation with Vietnam. The Swedish prime minister 
inaugurated an Ericsson mobile communication system in Vietnam. 
The Ericsson Group of Sweden is a well known manufacturer of 
electronic and telecom equipments. The visit to Vietnam by 
Australian prime minister came after the two countries reached 
an agreement on the construction of My Thuan Bridge crossing the 
Tien River in southern Vietnam. This makes Australia rank the 
first among investors in construction in Vietnam as well as of 
all Indochina. 
  From either side of the Earth, Sweden and Australia have one 
thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of 
Vietnam infrastructure, one of the most essential needs of 
Vietnam at the present moment. 
  The Australian prime minister also announced $140 million of 
aid to Hanoi to help the latter continue its renovation process. 
Sweden has also so far [word indistinct] granted aid to 
Vietnam. With the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, Sweden plans to boost the economic ties with Vietnam. It 
is a new decision taken by Sweden. 
  Both Australian and Swedish leaders acknowledged the 
positive 
results of the ongoing renovation process in Vietnam. The truth 
created by Vietnam itself has urged more countries to invest in 
the country.
