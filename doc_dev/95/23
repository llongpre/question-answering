  [Text] Australia's prime minister Paul Keating has 
rejected a call to highlight the role of Australian war veterans 
during his visit to Vietnam. In Thailand yesterday, Mr. Keating 
visited the graves of Australians who died working on the 
Thai-Burma railway during the second world war. National Party 
leader Tim Fisher has now urged Mr. Keating to make a similar 
gesture in Vietnam. However, as political correspondent Graeme 
Well reports, Mr. Keating said he'll be keeping the focus of his 
visit to economic development.

is involved in Vietnam's development. [end recording]
