  [Text] Vientiane, April 4 (KPL) -- Lao Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri on 
April 2 morning signed at Lan Xang Hotel in Vientiane an 
agreement concerning the friendship bridge across the Mekong 
River, scheduled to be officially opened on April 8. 
  The agreement deals with preparation for the official 
opening 
of the bridge in the presence of Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] Pesident Nouhak Phoumsavan and his majesty 
the king of Thailand. On the occasion, Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating will present the bridge, gift from the 
Australian government and people to the people of Laos and 
Thailand, to Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon and Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai. 
  The agreement represents a legal framework for Lao-Thai 
cooperation in all aspects concerning the management and 
maintenance of the bridge, including the ownership and 
cooperation in dealing with matters that may arise over the 
bridge. 
  This document also stipulates the following terms on the 
operation and maintenance of the bridge. 
  1. The two sides are jointly responsible for the management 
and maintenance of the bridge by equally sharing the cost of its 
management and maintenance. 
  2. A joint commission will be set up to determine and review 
procedures on the management and maintenance of the bridge to be 
carried out by a brigade with its routines according to the 
agreed procedures. 
  3. The sides have agreed that fees for cars passing the 
bridge will be charged only at one time at an equivalent rate as 
vehicles enter the bridge on either Lao or Thai sides, except 
for cargo trucks with drivers which will be charged for the 
passage on both sides. 
  4. The sides have agreed that each will try to simplify its 
transit formalities, making it convenient and fast to ensure the 
effective operation of the bridge. 
  Concerning the ownership over the bridge, the sides have 
agreed to divide it equally. This agreement will have no effect 
on the common border of the two countries as provided in the 
international law. On their cooperation on the bridge operation, 
the sides have agreed that each side sets up a permanent 
committee to monitor, coordinate, consult and discuss with each 
other concerning the operation of the bridge and matters that 
may arise over the area between the transition pier on both 
sides, including arrests of wrongdoers on the said area on a 
case-by-case basis. Solutions to the matters will be considered 
according to the law of each side, and measures against the 
wrongdoers will be taken as mandatory. 
  After signing the agreement, the foreign ministers of Laos 
and Thailand also gave a news conference.
