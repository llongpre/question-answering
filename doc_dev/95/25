  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President 
Suharto and visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating 
agreed here Tuesday to work together to reduce Indonesia's trade 
deficit with Australia. 
  Both leaders shared the view that bilateral trade ties 
between the two countries need to be intensified to cut the 
deficit, Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said when announcing 
the results of a two-hour talk between President Suharto and 
Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia is worth US 
$2.15 billion a year. 
  In the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than 
scheduled, the two heads of state also discussed the upcoming 
informal summit of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) to 
be held in Bogor, about 50 km south of Jakarta, on 15 November 
this year. 
  The second APEC meeting will be attended by representatives 
from 18 countries, namely the ASEAN member states (Indonesia, 
Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and 
Thailand), the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, Papua New 
Guinea, Chile, Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, 
Taiwan and Japan. Prime Minister Keating expressed his readiness 
to help Indonesia make the APEC meeting a success, Minister 
Murdiono said. [passage omitted -- covered in referent item] 
  Minister Murdiono also confirmed that President Suharto 
explained about the recent revocation of the licences of TEMPO 
weekly magazine, EDITOR magazine and DETIK tabloid to his guest. 
  Keating arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit to hold 
talks with President Suharto and other Indonesian officials. He 
is also scheduled to open a major Australian trade exhibition on 
Wednesday. 
  The trade exhibition is a part of "Australia Today Indonesia 
'94", the largest trade and cultural promotion program Australia 
has ever undertaken in the region. It is scheduled to last 
until 3 July 1994. This is the third visit Keating has made to 
Indonesia since he became prime minister.
