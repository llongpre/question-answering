  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 11 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
gave a banquet here this evening in honour of his Australian 
distinguished guests. At this event, he delivered a speech 
which read in part : 
  `It has been only a year since our first meeting in 
Canberra, 
but we have every reason to be satisfied with the rapid 
development of the multi-sided Vietnam-Australia cooperation, 
especially in the economic, trading, educational and training 
fields. We greatly appreciate Australia's active help to us in 
building a North-South 500 KV grid, a nearly-completed important 
project in our national construction. We also highly value the 
effective implementation of the Australian aid to train 
Vietnamese officials, as well as Australia's active contribution 
to a break-through in the relations between Vietnam and the 
international financial institutions. 
  `I am optimistic about the prospect for the development of 
friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries. 
Despite thousands of miles separating us and the difference in 
historical circumstances and cultural traditions between Vietnam 
and Australia, both of us have been looking towards the Pacific 
and identifying ourselves with the common desire for an expanded 
regional cooperation. 
  `We are satisfied with the results of the open and frank 
exchanges of talks between us today. We are convinced that the 
agreement between us in many fields will contribute to further 
consolidation and development of the on-going fine cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia'. 
  Prime Minister Paul Keating, for his part, said: 
  `The effect of the changes you have introduced, combined 
with 
the skill and enterprise of the Vietnamese people, have brought 
this country high levels of economic growth and have opened up 
new opportunities for our bilateral relationship. Australia, 
too, has been through a process of 'economic renovation'. We 
have opened our industry to competition and our economy to the 
world. 
  `I know, Mr Prime Minister, how difficult the task can be. 
But, like you, I also know how large are the rewards for our 
countries at the end of the process. 
  `And, like Vietnam Australia is also seeking closer links 
with our region not only economically but culturally, 
politically and strategically as well. 
  These parallel interests are creating unprecedented new 
opportunities for us. 
  Trade between Australia and Vietnam in 1982 was 2 million 
dollars. In 1993 it was 366 million dollars. 
  Australia is now Vietnam's third largest foreign investor, 
with nearly 800 million dollars invested here. 
  We are also developing new avenues for cooperation on 
regional issues. 
  And Vietnam can count on warm support from Australia as you 
move towards greater involvement in regional organisations. 
  Bilaterally, we are finding new opportunities to work 
together. 
  `I was also pleased to be able to tell you today, Mr Prime 
Minister, that Australia has committed more than 200 million 
dollars in a new four-year aid program, which we hope will cover 
areas such as education, health, infrastructure and legal 
training.
