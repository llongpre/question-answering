  [Excerpts] Laotian Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat 
will lead a delegation to Bangkok soon for talks on the 
maintenance and administration of the Thai-Lao Mittraphap bridge 
across the Mekong River, informed sources said. 
  Talks, set tentatively for 8-9 February, will also focus on 
official preparations far His Majesty the King's visit to 
Vientiane on the eve of the historic April 8 opening. 
  The bridge, financed and built by Australia, completes the 
first land link between Thailand and Laos. 
  The opening will be presided over by the King and the 
President of Laos, Nouhak Phomsavan, in the presence of Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, Laotian Prime Minister General Khamtai 
Siphandon, and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
  However, the build-up to the handover is being plagued by a 
lack of agreement on the question of boundaries. Visa issues 
have also yet to be settled. [passage omitted] 
  Thailand maintains that the boundary on the bridge should be 
drawn at the deepest point of the river, the same line which 
marks the frontier along the Mekong River between Thailand and 
Laos. 
  Laos has argued that the two nations should each have 
jurisdiction over and responsibility for half the bridge, in 
accordance with international practice. This boundary would not 
replace the official frontier. 
  The differences have embarrassed both sides, as such basic 
issues were supposed to have been smoothed over earlier in 
anticipation of the historic inauguration of the "friendship" 
bridge that symbolizes cordial ties between the two neighbors. 
  The sources however said the talks are unlikely to focus on 
measures to facilitate the two-way entry into both sides through 
the bridge.
