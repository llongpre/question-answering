  [Text] Vientiane, April 18 (KPL) -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed on April 16 arrived 
here on a three-day official visit to the Lao PDR [Lao People's 
Democratic Republic] at the invitation of Lao Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon. 
  The visit was in response to the December 1992 visit of the 
Lao prime minister to Malaysia, where three agreements were 
signed between the two governments concerning investment 
promotion and protection, economic, scientific and technical 
cooperation and air transportation. 
  During the visit, the Malaysian prime minister called on Lao 
President Nouhak Phoumsavan and met with Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon. 
  Talking with the Malaysian prime minister, President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan said this visit was very significant in the history 
of the Lao-Malaysian relations. He expressed hope that the 
bilateral relations would further develop fruitfully in many 
areas. In response, the Malaysian prime minister expressed 
pleasure over a warm hospitality the Lao Government and people 
gave to him and his party. He voiced support to the open-door 
policy of the Lao Government on economic relations and 
cooperation with foreign countries, and confirmed that he would 
do all he could to develop the friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in his discussion with 
his Malaysian counterpart also said that the visit was historic. 
He considered it as implementing the three agreements signed 
between the two governments in 1992. 
  On the same day afternoon, talks were held between the 
government delegations of the two countries headed by their 
respective prime ministers. At the talks, both sides discussed 
a wide range of issues concerning their bilateral cooperation, 
both public and private, in various fields. 
  The two prime ministers then witnessed the signing of an 
agreement on banking settlement between the governors of the 
central banks of the two countries. 
  In the evening, Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon hosted a 
banquet in honour of his Malaysian counterpart. 
  The Malaysian prime minister was officially welcomed at the 
airport by Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon together with 
Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and other members of the Lao Government 
officials. This three-day visit was the first ever made to the 
country by the Malaysian prime minister following the Lao prime 
minister's visit to Malaysia in December 1992. 
  The Malaysian delegation was accompanied by several 
important 
figures in the business circle of Malaysia.
