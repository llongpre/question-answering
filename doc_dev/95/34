  [Text] Canberra, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating today met with Deng Nan, visiting vice 
minister of the State Science and Technology Commission. He 
expressed hope that China and Australia would further expand 
cooperation and exchanges in science and technology in addition 
to increasing economic cooperation and trade. 
  Keating said: China and Australia can complement each other 
in the economic field, as well as in the arena of developing and 
applying science and technology. 
  He said: Increased Sino-Australian cooperation and exchanges 
in science and technology are of great importance for economic 
development in the two countries as well as in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  During the meeting, Deng Nan briefed Keating on a scientific 
and technological development plan that China is currently 
developing for the 21st century. Keating expressed keen 
interest in the plan and signaled Australia's willingness to 
cooperate with China. 
  Deng Nan conveyed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's regards to Prime 
Minister Keating. Keating said: Deng Xiaoping is one of the 
greatest figures in this century. His tremendous role in 
China's reform and opening up commands admiration. Keating 
asked Deng Nan to convey his regards to Deng Xiaoping and wished 
the latter good health. 
  As a special guest of Australia's Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, Deng Nan began a nine-day visit to Australia 
on 20 March.
