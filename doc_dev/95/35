  [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has left 
Australia for Laos to start his Southeast Asian tour. The 
eight-day visit to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam is aimed at 
improving Australia's trade relationship and developing the 
vision that Mr. Keating sees of Australia forging closer ties 
with Asia. 
  Mr. Keating says human rights issues will be raised during 
his visit to Vietnam, but they will be within a set framework. 
He says, as a democracy, Australia will put its views clearly 
and forthrightly, but in the interests of maintaining 
relationship with Asian countries; therefore, the situation had 
to be seen from an overall point of view. 
  One of the high points of Mr. Keating's visit will be to 
hand 
over the Australian-constructed and funded Friendship Bridge 
linking Laos and Thailand over the Mekong River.
