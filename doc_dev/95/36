  [Text] President Suharto and Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating held two-hour private talks on bilateral ties and 
APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] at Jakarta's Merdeka 
Palace this morning. Minister-State Secreatary Murdiono briefed 
reporters on the details of the meeting: 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] During the talks, the two leaders 
exchanged views on various issues, including bilateral, 
regional, and international events, as well as events related to 
APEC after the grouping's meeting in Seattle last year. Several 
points I can tell you are that the two leaders share the view 
that ties between Indonesia and Australia have progressed 
smoothly, while mutual understanding has also been enhanced 
since the two leaders met some time ago. We all know that Prime 
Minister Keating visited Indonesia a few months ago. 
  The two leaders also noted that bilateral trade ties have 
steadily increased and that there are more frequent exchanges of 
visits between the two countries' officials, both at the 
national and regional level. The president pointed out that in 
some Australian states, the Indonesian language has become the 
second language taught in schools. The two leaders also believe 
that relations between businessmen and private citizens should 
be further intensified because, geographically speaking, the two 
countries are indeed close neighbors which share similar views 
and objectives for the future, namely boosting cooperation for 
the progress of both countries. 
  The two leaders also discussed matters relating to APEC, as 
well as the APEC leaders' meeting on Blake Island. They noted 
that follow-up actions have been taken and these will be useful 
for preparations to hold the second APEC summit meeting 
scheduled in Indonesia in November. The Australian prime 
minister also expressed his desire to extend his assistance to 
make the upcoming APEC meeting successful. That is all I can 
tell you; thank you for your attention. [end recording]
