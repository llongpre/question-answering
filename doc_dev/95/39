  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating has encouraged his 
British counterpart, John Major, to use Australia as a trade and 
investment springboard into Asia. Mr. Keating has also raised 
Australia's ongoing trade concerns with Canada in a separate 
meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien. Linda 
Mottram reports that Mr. Keating met the British and Canadian 
leaders in London where they are gathering for the commemoration 
of the World War II D-day landing of Normandy 50 years ago. 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Ahead of the D-day ceremony, Mr. 
Keating met with Mr. Major in London with trade and investment 
are key agenda items in what the two leaders have described as a 
strong relationship. Officials say Mr. Keating assured Mr. 
Major that Australia's push for closer economic links with Asia 
did not exclude the Australia-Britain relationship. The 
Australian Government is keen for Britain to use its very high 
level of investment in Australia as a window into Asia. The two 
leaders also discussed the forthcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] leaders' summit in Jakarta and ways of 
advancing the Asia Pacific Economic Grouping. 
  Mr. Keating talked with Canada's Jean Chretien who described 
by officials as equally warm although Mr. Keating noted the 
bilateral relationship had languished somewhat in particular 
over trade tension. Officials described Mr. Keating as putting 
a strong argument for Canada to particularly review its decision 
to impose tariff quotas on the imports of Australian boneless 
beef. [end recording]
