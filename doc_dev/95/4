  [Text] Vientiane, April 7 (KPL) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating, yesterday morning handed over to Lao 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon the border control building on 
the Lao side of the friendship bridge. 
  Mr. Vang Lattanavong, Lao ambassador to Australia and Mr. 
Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to Laos were among high 
ranking officials from both sides at the solemn hand-over 
ceremony. 
  In his speech, Prime Minister Paul Keating said that 
speaking 
on behalf of the Australian Government and people, he was 
pleased to hand over the border control building to the Lao 
Government and people. He referred to the bridge as a door 
opening up to the development in the country and the adjacent 
facilities were regarded as the key of the development door. 
The building houses immigration, customs, police, banks and 
postal offices. He said that the border control building and 
the Mekong bridge itself could best serve to testify, in the 
concrete term, the fruitful Australian-Lao cooperation and 
friendship. Mr. Paul Keating congratulated both Australian and 
Lao technicians and workers whose high sense of responsibility 
fullfilled the construction targets in terms of time and budget. 
Australian prime minister touched upon the significance of the 
Australian-Lao agreement for the promotion and protection of 
investment which would help establish confidence for potential 
Australian investors. 
  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon of Laos in his return 
address, speaking on behalf of the Lao people, said that the 
facilities were built with Australian grant. Apart from the 
Mekong bridge, the border control building, the gifts of the 
Australian Government and people to Laos, would facilitate the 
work of the Lao personnel. 
  Mr. Khamtai Siphandon expressed thanks once again to the 
Australian side for its generosity and good intention. He said 
that the Australian aid projects for Laos were highly 
appreciated. They were the symbol for the ever increasing 
traditional relations of friendship the two countries had 
enjoyed. The Lao prime minister attached great importance to 
the Australian aid which had instrumentally helped building the 
country's economic infrastructure and helped free Laos from a 
state of economic difficulties. 
  After delivering their speeches, both prime ministers 
officially lifted the veil off the building foundation plate. 
  Mr. Paul Keating and his delegation left Laos on board of a 
special plane for an official visit to the Kingdom of Thailand. 
The Australian prime minister paid a two-day official visit to 
the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] on April 5 and 6.
