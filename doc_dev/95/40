  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 27 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
received here this afternoon Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat 
Lengsavat, who is now on a working visit to Vietnam. 
  At the reception, Minister Somsavat Lengsavat informed Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet of the results of this talks with the 
Vietnamese foreign minister. He highly valued the efforts of 
the Vietnamese Government and people in the implementation of 
the agreements signed between the high-ranking officials of 
Vietnam and Laos in the recent time which, he said, have made 
important contributions to bring the traditional friendly and 
cooperative relations between Vietnam and Laos to a new step of 
development. 
  Speaking to his guests, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet hoped 
that 
with its role the Lao Democratic People's Republic (LDPR) would 
make positive contributions to the implementation of the Paris 
agreement on Cambodia, thus promoting the process of peace in 
Cambodia. He wished that the Lao people under the clear sighted 
leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party headed by 
President [title as received] Khamtai Siphandon would continue 
to obtain greater achievements in their cause of building a Lao 
country of peace, prosperity, and development. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet asked the Lao foreign minister to 
convey his regards to Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon.
