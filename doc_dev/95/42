  [Text] During their formal meeting at Government House 
today, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating discussed expanding bilateral trade and 
investment cooperation and promoting free trade practices. 
  Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's 
Office, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment 
policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use 
Thailand as an aviation center for Qantas Airlines. The Thai 
side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products 
which have difficulties when imported to Australia and those 
products which were once accused of market dumping by asking 
Australia to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said: 
  [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides 
exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral 
cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade, 
investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two 
sides have recognized the important role of the economic 
cooperation forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation, or APEC, and discussed possible ways to further 
expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the 
possibility of linking economic cooperation between the ASEAN 
Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called 
CER, of which Australia and New Zealand are members. This issue 
has never been brought up for official discussion previously. 
However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further 
actions must be taken in this regard. Thailand itself can bring 
up this matter during ASEAN meetings, while Australia seeks 
consultations with New Zealand as well as members of ASEAN, AFTA 
[ASEAN Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral 
economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides 
agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and 
discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade 
measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of 
others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of 
multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the 
two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the 
security issue. [end recording] 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting, 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak disclosed that the 
two sides agreed to turn APEC into a multilateral economic 
cooperation grouping. Suphachai said: 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral 
cooperation with APEC. The Australian side reiterated its 
concern over this issue. It noted that the United States is 
moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the 
right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are 
involved in any agreement. Australia does not want the United 
States to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is 
doing with Japan. Therefore, Australia asks Thailand to help to 
build up the strength of APEC because APEC was established with 
support from U.S. politicians and economists who support the 
principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see APEC 
lay idle for fear that certain elements in the United States 
might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis. 
Prime Minister Chuan reaffirmed that Thailand has always 
supported and wants to see a strong APEC. However, he suggested 
that APEC apply GATT agreements as soon as possible and try to 
comply with GATT rules. He also noted that APEC members are not 
equally developed like countries in the European Union. This 
issue must also be considered. [end recording]
