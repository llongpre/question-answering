<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, says he is 
ready to establish full diplomatic relations with the United 
States immediately. In a rare interview, Mr. Kiet told Radio 
Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, that 
disputes between the two sides over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnman War presented no hurdles to normal ties. 
And the 71-year old Vietnamese leader indicated his willingness 
to stay at the helm of government for another couple of years, 
despite being past retirement age. From Hanoi, Christoper Kramer 
filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kramer] In his first interview since the 
lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in February, Mr. Kiet spoke 
for almost an hour about regional issues and relations with 
Australia and the United States. He said the recent visit of 
Prime Minister Paul Keating had seen a frank exchange of views 
based on friendship, leading to agreement on bilateral and 
regional issues. 
  Regarding the U.S., Mr. Kiet said the lifting of the embargo 
had improved the conditions for the continuing search for 
American MIA's and the disputes over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnam War presented no obstacles to full 
normalization of relations with Washington. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Vietnam 
intends that the normalized relations between the United States 
and Vietnam inevitably will come. We are ready at any point of 
time for that because the normalized relations between the two 
countries are not only in the interests of the two countries but 
also in the interests of the region and the world over. 
  [Kramer] On the domestic situation, Mr. Kiet said the 
elimination of poverty was his government's main priority. But 
asked whether Vietnam wanted to move toward some form of 
multiparty democracy, he said maintenance of political stability 
was more important. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Looking 
around as well as looking at the situation in Eastern Europe, we 
could see that there is such a lesson. 
  [Kramer] Mr. Kiet did, however, commit the communist party 
to continued political as well as economic reforms. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] We 
clearly see the interrelationship and the mutually supporting 
relationship between the economic reform and the political 
reform -- these two areas are closely linked with each other and 
one gives [word indistinct] for the other. 
  [Kramer] Since Mr. Kiet came to office in 1992, he has 
presided over Vietnam's spectacular return to the world 
community, but on the domestic front he faces a widening gap 
between rich and poor and the daunting task of managing the 
country's transition from communism to free market economy. 
  Along with the president and communist party leader, he is 
widely expected to step down at around the time of the next 
communist party congress late next year or in early 1996. But 
having seen him in action on the tennis court, I can report that 
the prime minister is fighting fit and in no mood to step down. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] If I am 
be able to contribute to the development of the country in line 
with the already identified projects, and if my personal health 
permits me, and if there is a need expressed by the people, then 
I try my best. [end recording]
