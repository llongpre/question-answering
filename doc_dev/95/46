  [Excerpts] SYDNEY, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten left a meeting with Prime Minister Paul Keating on 
Tuesday without winning Australia's public endorsement of 
Britain's drive for greater democracy in the colony. But Patten 
said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's 
support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was 
delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory 
meeting." 
  Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official 
residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional 
issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) 
group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Patten, who is on a six-day 
official visit at Keating's invitation, told reporters his visit 
was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian 
businesses to use Hong Kong as a springboard to China. [passage 
omitted] 
  Keating has never denied reports that he told Chinese 
Premier 
Li Peng in Beijing last June that Australia did not support 
Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong. "Australia is 
not particularly impressed with Patten's modus operandi or his 
taking an interest in Hong Kong's political situation so late in 
the peace," Keating reportedly said. 
  However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans subsequently told 
parliament that Australia had consistently expressed to both 
China and Britain its "support for democratic reform" consistent 
with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British declaration paving the 
way for Hong Kong's handback in 1997. [passage omitted] 
  An Australian government official said later that the 
meeting 
had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not 
know if Keating had privately endorsed Britain's position. 
  "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to Australia 
of 
Hong Kong's continuing prosperity and stability in the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997," the official said.
