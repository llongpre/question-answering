<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent] </F>
  [Summary] Dear friends: This morning in the capital city 
of Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage paid 
a courtesy call on Acting King [title as heard] Chea Sim. Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet was accompanied by Norodum Sirivut, 
Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs 
and international cooperation. Acting King Chea Sim cordially 
received Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage. He 
expressed his gratitude to the Vietnamese Government for its 
constant efforts to help bring about peace in Cambodia. He was 
convinced that this historic visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
will contribute to strengthening the friendship between Vietnam 
and Cambodia a step further. He briefed Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet on the current situation in Cambodia and informed him that 
King Norodom Sihanouk's health condition was good and that the 
King would return to Cambodia on 8 April. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
thanked 
the Cambodian leaders for having accorded the Vietnamese 
Government delegation a warm welcome. He assured His Excellency 
Chea Sim of the desire and persistent efforts of the Vietnamese 
Government and people to do all they can to preserve and promote 
friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia. He expressed his belief that with the 
goodwill and efforts of both sides, these ties will continue to 
be consolidated and developed with each passing day. 
  Afterward, at 0900, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and First 
Prime Minister Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
signed the Vienamese-Cambodian joint communique on the 
conclusion of the visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. The signing ceremony was held at Chamka 
Mon Palace. 
  Next, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and 
Norodom 
Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, signed the agreements on 
cultural, educational, training, and scientific-technological 
cooperation as well as on the establishment of a joint economic, 
cultural, and scientific-technological cooperation committee. 
Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet and Cambodian Commerce 
Minister Va Huot signed the agreements on economic and trade 
cooperation and on goods transit between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the comrades accompanying him 
left Phnom Penh for home this morning. Seeing the Vietnamese 
delegation off at Pochentong International Airport were First 
Minister Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, and many other high-ranking Cambodian 
Government officials. Also on hand to bid farewell to Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage were members of the 
diplomatic corps, representatives of international organizations 
in Phnom Penh, and members of the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia. 
  Prime Minister Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen invited 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to step on a red-carpeted honorary 
stand as a military band played the national anthems of Cambodia 
and Vietnam. Next, the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as the latter reviewed the guard of 
honor and bade farewell to Cambodian and foreign officials. The 
special plane carrying Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the 
comrades accompanying him took off at 1000 sharp. 
  Twenty-four hours is too short for an official friendship 
visit. Yet, thanks to the positive efforts of both sides, this 
visit brought about fine results and opened a new step in the 
development of relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.
