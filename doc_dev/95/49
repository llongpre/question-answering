<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating is on his 
way to Jakarta this afternoon with his eyes firmly set on what 
he calls one of Australia's most important international 
relationships. The focus on the interests the two countries 
share in the Asia-Pacific means that the Indonesian media 
crackdown is well down on the Keating agenda. Mr. Keating is 
under pressure from some Australian lobby groups to take 
Indonesia to task after Jakarta last week closed the country's 
three leading weekly news magazines -- TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK. 
But the prime minister says he'll be using his informal talk 
with President Suharto tomorrow to discuss the APEC [Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation] Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in 
Jakarta in November. Mr. Keating told Graeme Dobell that the 
Suharto government's closure of its three leading news magazines 
was a backward step during a period of rapid change: 
  [Begin recording] [Keating] Indonesia is like many countries 
in the region; it's in a state of constant change where there 
are many imperatives starting to impact on the country: the 
growth imperative and all that brings with it for change, and 
diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt that these 
are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone days as 
they are now. For our part, Gareth Evans as foreign minister 
has made clear Australia's disappointment about the fact that 
these [word indistinct] have been changed. But again, from our 
point of view, I mean there are the same, similar things -- 
there is press control in China and we're still doing trade with 
China, there is a fairly tight control of the press in Malaysia 
and we are still doing trade with Malaysia. I think, you know, 
this relationship now has many links to it and it does give us 
the opportunity, I think, to, you know, maintain a working 
relationship despite some of these things which are 
disappointments to us. 
  [Dobell] Does it symbolize [words indistinct] to put on the 
brakes? Is it a step back from the policy of openness that 
President Suharto has been talking about? 
  [Keating] Well, I think it may be that we will witness in 
many countries similar to Indonesia -- such as Indonesia, 
similar to Indonesia -- that there'll be, you know, (?full) four 
steps forward and one back and four forward and one back and 
then I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong 
public opinion -- reactions -- about this, where there is any 
crimp on information, wherever it occurs in most places, and I 
understand this to be the case in Indonesia as well. 
  [Dobell] One of the comments from Jakarta has been from the 
head of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, Abdulraham 
Wahid, who said that he thought you, as a friend, should speak 
to the president on this. Do you have a duty perhaps as a 
friend to speak to Suharto on this? 
  [Keating] Australia is not the international news and media 
plurality policeman. Now, there is a sort of view around that 
because we have a very free press we ought to be arguing for a 
press similar to ours wherever we go. Well, we are an open and 
plural country and that's part of our strength, and we're also 
very forthright. But, you know, I mean I could make my next 
visit to China. The first item on the agenda I'll put press 
freedom and plurality. We [words indistinct] first agenda item 
no one should choose. [End recording]
