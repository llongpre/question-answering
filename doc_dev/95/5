  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 11 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
held talks here this morning with Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating, now on an official friendship visit to Vietnam. 
Speaking at the talks, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet welcomed 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and his wife's first 
official friendship visit to Vietnam as an important event, 
opening a new chapter in the relations of friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries. The Vietnamese leader 
informed the Australian prime minister of the achievements 
recorded by the Vietnamese people in the current renovation 
process and in the implementation of the foreign policy of 
independence, sovereignty and openess in the direction of 
diversification and multilateralization of international 
relations. He reaffirmed Vietnam's desire to strengthen the 
relations of friendship and all-sided cooperation with Australia 
on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits. For his part, 
Mr.Paul Keating thanked Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife 
and the Vietnamese people for their hospitality. He spoke 
highly of the achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in 
various fields, particularly economy in the renovation process. 
The two sides expressed their satisfaction at the rapid 
development of the friendship and effective cooperation in many 
fields since Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Australia 
in May 1993. They also expressed their wishes to promote the 
multi-sided cooperation between the two countries, and held that 
the two countries could supplement each other in their economic 
development process for the prosperity of each country, as well 
as of the Asian-Pacific region. They exchanged views on 
measures to further strengthen the cooperative relations between 
the two countries. 
  The Vietnamese side highly appreciated Australia's policy 
of attaching importance to the development of cooperation with 
Vietnam in trade, investment and other fields and its aid 
programme to Vietnam, especially Australia's experience sharing, 
technical assistance and personnel training to Vietnam as well 
as its cooperation in building the north-south 500 kv power line. 
  The Australian side pledged to continue its aid to 
Vietnam, and said that Australia was ready to broaden its 
cooperation and assistance to Vietnam in the oil and gas 
industry, telecommunications, energy, water resources, 
infrastructure construction, healthcare, education, personnel 
training and preservation of Hanoi's ancient sector. The two 
sides also compared notes on international and regional issues 
of common concern. Early this morning a state ceremony was held 
at the presidential palace to welcome Prime Minister Paul 
Keating, his wife and their entourage who arrived here 
yesterday. Present at the ceremony were Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, Mayor of Hanoi Le At Hoi 
and other Vietnamese officials. This evening, Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet and his wife gave a banquet in honour of Prime Minister 
P.Keating, his wife and other distinguished Australian guests.
