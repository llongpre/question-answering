<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Mission to Asia"] </F>
  [Text] After the black comedy of Mr Keating's mad 
squabble with the Vietnam veterans, readers will be relieved to 
hear that there was a serious purpose to the Prime Minister's 
visit to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and that, by all accounts, 
it went quite well. 
  The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship 
Bridge over the Mekong River on the border of Thailand and Laos. 
  The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen 
Australia's relations with two of the most important nations in 
the region. 
  In Australia, the political focus naturally has been on the 
Vietnamese part of the trip because Vietnam is the flavour of 
the month, because of the row with the veterans and because this 
is the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since the war. 
  However, that should not be allowed to overshadow the 
importance of the visit to Thailand. By far the biggest economy 
on Mr. Keating's itinerary, Thailand is also of growing 
strategic and diplomatic importance to Australia. 
  Economically, diplomatically and militarily, Thailand is a 
major player in ASEAN and a friendly rival of ASEAN's other 
major players, Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  For Australia, that makes Thailand a particularly important 
friend. The Thais' shrewd and predictable diplomacy and their 
distance from Australia mean that Australian-Thai relations tend 
to be more stable than our relations with Malaysia and 
Indonesia. (Curiously, distance does seem to be an important 
factor; for example, Thailand's human rights lapses seem to 
attract less attention here than Indonesia's.) At moments of 
tension between Australia and Malaysia or Indonesia, the Thais 
have interceded on Australia's behalf. 
  Thailand is a longstanding friend and an alternative 
diplomatic and economic "gateway" to the region, always ready to 
accept Australian investment and trade if other countries are 
not so inclined. That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on 
Australia's relations with its more volatile ASEAN neighbours. 
  With its well-developed defence forces (including 
significant 
naval forces) and its borders with Cambodia and Laos, Thailand 
is also an important player in the development of Cambodia and 
Indo-China. 
  Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic. 
  Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long-term 
potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to 
come. 
  Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential 
importance in the region, mainly because of its large and 
well-educated population and its border with China. 
  The Chinese are paranoid about Vietnam, which is why they 
spent a fortune to support the Khmer Rouge on Vietnam's 
south-western flank. 
  The central objective of Western policy towards Vietnam must 
be the country's successful economic and political integration 
into the international community. 
  Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to 
rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is 
insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich 
natural resources and to create employment in labour-intensive 
manufacturing. 
  The Vietnamese Communist Party is terrified of the kind of 
political instability that has plagued Eastern Europe, and with 
good reason. Vietnam's young population (the median age is 19) 
means that the labour force is growing at a rate of 1 million a 
year. The rationalisation of inefficient State-owned industries 
means that jobs will be scarce for a good while yet. 
  Australia's policy is both to contribute to Vietnam's 
development and to share in it. 
  As aid projects, Mr Keating's proposed high-profile projects 
-- including a $100 million bridge over the Mekong River and the 
preservation of Hanoi's historic architecture -- sound as 
questionable as the Hawke Government's Friendship Bridge that 
Mr. Keating went to Asia to open. 
  However, Mr Keating obviously expects the political and 
economic benefits to Australia of the projects (in terms of 
goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly 
competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in 
their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people. 
  Of course, other countries are also trying to share in the 
Vietnamese revival. Mr Keating was the sixth leader and the 
14th senior politician to visit Vietnam in a month. 
  For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of Mr. 
Keating's visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated. 
  Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant, 
positive step in the development of Australian-Vietnamese 
relations.
