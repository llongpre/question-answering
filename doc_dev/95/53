Keating visits Indochina
Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, begins an eight-day visit to
Indochina, incorporating stops in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will be
the first time an Australian prime minister has visited post-war Vietnam.
Mr Keating's visit follows strenuous efforts to shore up Australia's
position in Vietnam, now that the US trade embargo against the country has
been lifted. Australia currently ranks fifth among countries awarded
investment licences in Vietnam, but is expected to face formidable
competition for contracts in infrastructure and telecommunications from US
corporations.
Nato general in Romania
General George Joulwan, Nato Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, begins a
two-day visit to Romania where he will meet President Ion Iliescu and other
senior officials. General Joulwan will discuss ways of improving military
co-operation between Romania and Nato within the framework of the
Partnership for Peace, which Romania signed in January. Last month President
Bill Clinton lifted the US embargo on high technology arms sales to Romania.
Talbott begins trip
Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, begins a nine-day trip to
India, Pakistan, Poland, Slovakia, and Nato in Brussels.
Greece tackles tax evaders
Greece's socialist government will consider a tax bill, aimed at cracking
down on Greece's legion of tax evaders, at a special cabinet meeting. The
bill will try to redress the injustice of easily taxed wage earners paying
the largest share of Greece's tax burden.
Premium Bond millionaire
Ernie, the National Savings computer, picks the first Pounds 1m monthly
Premium Bond jackpot prize. The UK's Premium Bonds, which have no capital
growth but offer holders the chance of winning cash, used to have a Pounds
250,000 jackpot.
Japanese trade surplus
The Japanese current account surplus in February is expected to widen to
Dollars 12.2bn, from Dollars 6.8bn in January. The strong yen is still
boosting the dollar value of Japanese exports, and keeping the surplus high.
However, this short-term effect may be followed by a downturn in exports and
a reduced surplus as the yen makes Japanese goods uncompetitive.
Budget tax rises bite
The start of the new UK tax year means that Britons finally face many of the
additional charges imposed in the two 1993 Budgets. A 1 percentage point
rise in employees' National Insurance payments and the reduction in relief
on the married couple's tax allowance will have the biggest effect on pay
packets.
The imposition of value added tax on fuel and the reduction in mortgage
interest tax relief have already begun to take effect.
Banesto deadline
This is the last day for banks to register as potential buyers of Banesto,
the troubled Spanish bank which is due to be auctioned. Sealed bids will
have to be submitted by April 25. The front runners in the auction -
Argentaria, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - have already
registered.  .TX- Danish bond issue  .TX- Denmark will become the latest
European sovereign borrower to lengthen the maturity of its bonds from 10
years, by introducing a 30-year government bond with a 6 per cent coupon.
Since the bonds will be sold on a 'tap' basis it is not clear how much the
Danish government intends to raise through this offering. Traders say the
bonds will not remain liquid for long if the government issues less than
DKr12bn-DKr15bn worth.
The market is also unsure about the proposed pricing of the bonds. Traders
are basing their forecasts on the yield differentials between 10-year and
30-year government bonds in France, the Netherlands and Germany where the
spreads range from 50 basis points to nearly 70 basis points. Some traders
expect Denmark's 30-year bond to yield just over 60 basis points over the 8
per cent bonds due 2003 which were yielding around 6.90 per cent late last
week.
Nazarbayev in Japan
Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has attracted western
investment to help develop his country's rich oil and gas reserves, goes to
Japan for a four-day tour.
Nazarbayev, whose globe-trotting has enhanced his reputation as the leader
of one of the more stable regimes in the region, recently called for the
former Soviet Union's transformation into a Euro-Asian union.

Hurd arrives in Brasilia
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd comes to Brasilia for talks after
arriving in Brazil on Tuesday. He is due to stay until Friday, when he will
fly on to the Falkland Islands.
As well as cementing growing economic ties, Hurd may sign an extradition
treaty. This is, however, unlikely to lead to the extradition of Ronnie
Biggs, the escaped train robber, who lives in Rio de Janeiro.
Balladur in Beijing
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, will travel to Beijing for a
four-day visit aimed at setting the seal on improved relations between
France and China. The visit follows France's announcement in January that it
would no longer sell arms to Taiwan, a long-standing source of friction.
UK economic figures
UK manufacturing output and industrial production figures for February are
unlikely to be as strong as they were in January, which saw month-on-month
rises of 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. The figures are very
volatile and some analysts are accordingly expecting manufacturing output to
have fallen in February.
However, recent Confederation of British Industry surveys have been positive
and the average forecast is for manufacturing output to have risen 0.4 per
cent and industrial production 0.5 per cent, indicating a continuing UK
recovery.
German jobless statistics
In the middle of this week Germany releases March's unemployment figures.
Observers are expecting the jobless numbers to rise further towards the 4.5m
figure which Ulrich Castellieri, a Deutsche Bank board member, forecast for
the end of this year.
Although seasonal factors might affect the short-term outlook, the
consistent upward trend can be counted on, if only because most of German
industry - including the banks - are still in the middle of their
rationalisation programmes.
US Masters
The Australian golfer Greg Norman should be the favourite to win this
prestigious tournament in Augusta, Georgia (until 10 April) after clinching
the Players Championship last month.

South African summit
ANC leader Nelson Mandela, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu
Inkatha party, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and South African President FW
de Klerk will meet to try to resolve the impasse over Zulu participation in
the April 26-28 election.
The Zulu leaders demand guarantees on the king's status after the elections.
Mandela and de Klerk seek Inkatha's agreement not to impede voting in Natal,
which includes the Zulu homeland, KwaZulu, run by Inkatha.
A state of emergency was declared in Natal last Thursday to try to control
the escalating violence between ANC and Inkatha supporters.
EU finance meeting
European Union finance ministers meet in Athens for two days of informal
talks. The main items on the agenda will be the operation of the European
Monetary System and the prospects, if any, for a return to the old narrow
fluctuation bands for member currencies; the financing of the trans-European
networks in road, rail, telecommunications and energy; and the prospects for
further cuts in European interest rates to lift the continental economy out
of recession.
Friendship Bridge opens
The first bridge across the lower Mekong river will be officially opened by
Australian prime minister Paul Keating, marking another step in the economic
development of south-east Asia. The 'Friendship Bridge' linking Vientiane,
the capital of landlocked Laos, with the northern Thai town of Nong Khai,
was built with Australian aid at a cost of about USDollars 30m.
Thailand and Laos expect the bridge to ease the increasing flow of tourists
and trade between the two countries, although some Lao officials are worried
that their once isolated country will become a truck stop between southern
China and the maritime states of the region.
Fourth Test match begins
The fourth Test match between England and the West Indies begins in
Bridgetown, Barbados (until 13 April). England's cricketers hope to salvage
some pride after their disastrous batting collapse in the last Test, which
gave West Indies the series.

Argentina goes to the polls
Voters in Argentina go to the polls on Sunday to choose a constituent
assembly that will rewrite the country's 1853 constitution. Lifting the
constitution's ban on consecutive presidential terms will allow President
Carlos Menem to run for a second term in 1995. The polls forecast an easy
victory for Menem's Peronist party.
Ukrainian election run-off
Ukraine faces a complete gas cut-off on Sunday as its citizens return to the
polls for run-off elections for the nation's first post-Soviet parliament.
Russia's Gazprom is demanding that Ukraine pay its near Dollars 1bn gas debt
by Sunday. Ukraine is scrambling to put together a barter package of cars,
food and machinery for Russian oil and gas. There is also a proposal to
clear Ukraine's debt by giving Russia a stake in its gas industry.
The Grand National
Britain's most famous steeplechase takes place at Aintree, near Liverpool,
on Saturday. Last year's race ended in chaos after a false start when
several jockeys completed the course ignorant of attempts by officials to
stop them.
Gatt pact to be signed
The long-delayed final act of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
Uruguay Round trade agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 12 April, in
Marrakesh, Morocco. Trade ministers will be meeting from Monday to Friday
and the US wants discussion to focus on the link between workers' rights and
the world trading system.
The signing will come a few days before the expiry of the 'fast-track'
negotiating authority extended by Congress to President Clinton in April
1993. Under this procedure Congress must accept or reject a proposed trade
agreement, and may not substantially amend it.
Israeli pull-out deadline
April 14 is the deadline for Israel to pull its forces out of the Gaza Strip
and Jericho in the occupied territories. Recent progress in the talks
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation has meant this date
may be met, though there is still disagreement over the size of the
Palestinian police force.
