  [Text] Canberra, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating said today that he expects China and his 
country to increase cooperation in science and technology. 
  while the two countries have witnessed a rapid growth in 
bilateral trade for the past years, there is great potential for 
closer ties in science and technology between them, Keating said. 
  Meeting Deng Nan, visiting vice minister of China's State 
Science and Technology Commission, Keating said that further 
strengthening of the science links between China and Australia 
will be beneficial to the economic development of not only the 
two countries themselves but also the Asia Pacific region. 
  During the meeting, Deng briefed Keating on China's plan of 
science and technology development in the 21st century, in which 
Keating expressed his interest. 
  As a guest of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade, Deng is currently on a 9-day visit here starting from 
March 20.
