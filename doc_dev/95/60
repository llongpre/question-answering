  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, now turns 
from marking the D-Day anniversary to a round of bilateral 
meetings in France after offering the French an olive branch. 
Linda Mottram reports from France: Mr. Keating stepped back 
from comments last year in a trade row that France had forgotten 
the sacrifice made for it in the Second World War. 
  [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating has praised French 
President Francois Mitterrand for his thanks during the D-Day 
celebrations to those countries whose people fought and died in 
the liberation of Europe in World War II. Mr. Keating says it's 
now clear to him the French have not forgotten the war 
sacrifice, as he had claimed in France last year at the tense 
end of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. 
Mr. Keating's next engagement in France is a meeting with 
President Mitterrand. 
  [Keating] This is a good opportunity, I think, to, you know, 
again go over common ground with the government of France and 
I'll be looking forward to meetings with President Mitterrand 
and Prime Minister Balladur. [end recording]
