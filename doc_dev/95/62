  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating managed to 
minimize the changes to his ministry in a reshuffle forced by 
the shock resignation of his industry minister last weekend. 
Assuming the industry mantle is Senator Peter Cook, trade 
minister for almost a year who has steered the country's trade 
interests through a tough 12 months while heading the Cairns 
Group of free trading agricultural nations. But the real winner 
is the quiet but highly respected and capable Senator Bob 
McMullan, who has been elevated to the trade portfolio. 
Australian Affairs Correspondent Linda Mottram reports on the 
changes: 
  [Begin Mottram recording] When former Industry Minister Alan 
Griffiths fell on his sword of alleged financial impropriety in 
his electorate office, he created a headache for the prime 
minister, forcing the second ministerial reshuffle since 
December when then-treasurer John Dawkins unexpectedly stepped 
down under somewhat different circumstances. The fact of that 
earlier reshuffle made these changes more difficult with the 
number of ministers who were potential candidates for industry 
only just settling into their new portfolios. But after a week 
turning over the option, Paul Keating has found a formula with a 
minimum of change but that rewards good service. Peter Cook 
will take on the industry portfolio with his first big job, the 
delivery of a new industry policy statement due in April. 
Senator Cook is known to have impressed the prime minister with 
his 10-month stewardship of the trade portfolio, a period 
featuring difficult talks with the United States over the use of 
farm export subsidy that also saw the ushering in of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and continuing evolution 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, and the 
long-awaited successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the 
GATT trade liberalization talks. And that service, plus Peter 
Cook's earlier ministries, including resources and industrial 
relations, position him well for his new job of industry, 
technology, and regional development. 
  The biggest elevation, though, is for Senator Bob McMullan, 
long overlooked for ministries during the years of Bob Hawke's 
leadership largely because of his non-aligned status amidst the 
Labor Party's rigid factional system. A highly capable 
performer in parliament since the late 1980's, his first full 
ministry came after the March election last year -- the arts and 
administrative services portfolio with cabinet status. Now, 
Senator McMullan shifts up to trade, giving his beloved arts 
portfolio to the existing communications minister, Michael Lee. 
But Senator McMullan will be able to deliver his culture 
statement -- a pet project -- due in weeks. 
  The changes end a week of uncertainty in the Keating 
Government and give the prime minister a full complement of 
ministers to handle the resumption of parliamentary sittings 
next week. But in overall numbers, the ministry is one down, 
that is, the prime minister has left a vacancy -- should Alan 
Griffiths be cleared of impropriety as he insists he will be -- 
and should he be returned to the front bench. If that happens, 
the ambitious Mr. Griffiths will be picking up his career at a 
level junior to the status he just voluntarily abandoned. He 
would likely take on the administrative services portfolio. His 
future, though, is in the hands of two inquiries and then in the 
hands of his colleagues who must decide who they want as their 
ministers. [end recording]
