  [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said that he welcomes the 
recent issuance of economic deregulation package to encourage 
greater foreign investments flow to Indonesia. 
  "We are happy about the decision taken by Indonesia to adopt 
a policy of greater investment opportunities and also about 
today's news reports on more deregulation packages," Keating 
told a press conference here Tuesday. 
  Jakarta on Monday announced a deregulation package for the 
industrial sector that reduces import duties on 739 tariff codes 
covering manufacturing, agricultural, and health products. 
  The government earlier this month also announced a new 
investment policy which allows foreign investors to have 95 
percent shares in a join venture company. 
  Trade value between Indonesia and Australia was recorded at 
U.S. $3 billion in 1993. 
  Keating also said that issues on Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum, bilateral ties, and economic 
cooperation dominated his two-hour talk with President Suharto 
earlier Tuesday. 
  He said that during the meeting President Suharto briefed 
him 
on the importance of maintaining national stability and national 
unity at a time of great economic growth and transformation. 
  Underlining that relationship between Indonesia and 
Australia 
have improved dramatically in the last few years, he said that 
the president also touched on other issues on the World Trade 
Organization. [sentence as received] 
  When asked about the roles of Indonesia and ASEAN in general 
within the structure of APEC, Keating said that ASEAN obviously 
has a great role in the APEC forum. 
  "Indonesia now chairs the APEC," he said adding that such a 
position is making Indonesia and other ASEAN countries important. 
  He further said that he had also expressed his regret to 
President Suharto over the recent banning of three Indonesian 
weeklies. 
  However, he also quoted the Indonesian head of state as 
saying that "journalists had put some of these things... 
national unity and stability at risk." 
  The banned press publications are TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK 
which are all based in Jakarta. 
  Keating arrived in Jakarta on Monday evening for a two day 
unofficial visit during which he will open an 
Australia-Indonesia business seminar and attend the Australia 
Today Indonesia 1994 held here from June 29 to July 3.
