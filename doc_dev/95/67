  [Text] Australia aims to be the region's leading supporter 
of women's development programmes in anticipation of the UN 
Conference on Women in Beijing this September and the World 
Summit for Social Development in March 1995, an Australian 
official told THE NATION. 
  Priorities for this year's overseas assistance are boosting 
cooperation with non-governmental organization (NGOs) and 
enhancing small programmes that are of mutual benefit to 
countries involved, said Ellen Shipley, a counsellor in the 
Technical and Economic Cooperation Section of the Australian 
Embassy in Bangkok. 
  Australia's overseas aid programme has come under attack 
from 
its own NGOs for being too aligned with Australia's commercial 
interests at the expense of helping the poor abroad. 
  According to an embassy press statement, half of the A$ 
[Australian dollars] 1.4 billion in overseas aid earmarked in 
the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau 
(AIDAB) 1994- 1995 budget will go to 13 countries in Southeast 
Asia and the Indian subcontinent. 
  Shipley said Australia wants to cooperate better in this 
area 
because "we're located in this region -- we want to be a 
complete partner in this region." 
  She was attending a workshop here along with 30 development 
project officers from Australian embassies in 13 countries, from 
Vietnam to Pakistan. The training session was the second held 
in the past 18 months, giving participants -- a number of them 
locally hired -- a chance to exchange views and learn about 
policy development. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating recently pledged 
A$350 
million over the next four years to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. 
  Hieng Sokchea, Senior Administrative Clerk in the 
Development 
Cooperation Unit of Australia's Phnom Penh Embassy, said the 
four sectors he's pinpointed were education, agriculture, health 
and infrastructure. Australian aid to Cambodia doubled to A$92 
million in the 1994-95 fiscal budget. 
  Sokchea said more than 15 bridges, costing an estimated A$10 
million, will be built along Road 5 from Phnom Penh to 
Battambang. 
  For Laos, A$48 million was promised over the next four 
years. 
One-third will go to training and human development programmes, 
while one-fifth is for infrastructure projects. 
  Vietnam's aid was doubled to A$140 million, making it the 
third top overseas recipient after Papua New Guinea and 
Indonesia. 
  For Thailand, Shipley said one third of the Bt [baht] 500 
million assistance pledged is geared toward educational 
programmes and, although there is a focus on rural programmes, 
Canberra is "looking at bigger infrastructure programmes". 
  Shipley pointed out that one of Thailand's most crucial 
problems is income disparity, so her country is supporting a new 
programme on small local NGOs that will have an impact on income 
generation.
