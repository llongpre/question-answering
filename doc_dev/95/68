Australia and Japan will push for a free trade pledge at the next summit of
the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum in Indonesia in November,
writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said yesterday at the end of
a four-day visit to Japan, Australia's largest trade partner, that he
thought Japan wanted 'to see a commitment to trade liberalisation in the
region'.
Mr Keating's announcement came after talks with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his
Japanese counterpart. The Australian leader gave firm backing for Japan's
attempt to become a permanent member of the UN security council.
In return, Mr Murayama promised Australia that it would not be excluded form
any trade accord between Tokyo and Washington, believed to be the first such
guarantee from a Japanese prime minister, said Australian officials.
