A row over remarks by Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, about his
Malaysian counterpart, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, shows signs of worsening. Mr
Keating had called Dr Mahathir recalcitrant for not attending last month's
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle.
Yesterday, Mr Ahmad Badawi, Malaysia's foreign minister, said Australia's
high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur had been called to the Foreign Ministry
and a protest had been made. A similar protest was lodged at Mr Keating's
office by the Malaysian High Commission in Canberra.
While Dr Mahathir seemed at first to play down the issue, his ministers have
been increasing their attacks on Mr Keating and have demanded a public
apology. Mr Samy Vellu, energy and telecommunications minister, said
yesterday that he had directed departments under his ministry to review
business ties with Australia.
Australian businessmen and investors in Malaysia are concerned about the
consequences of a prolonged row. Malaysia has become one of their most
important overseas markets. Trade between the two countries was worth
MDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 1.76bn) last year, with the balance well in
Australia's favour.
Australia also earns substantial amounts from an estimated 8,000 Malaysian
students in the country, and Malaysians are among the leading buyers of
Australian property.
Mr Mohamad Rachmat, Malaysia's information minister, has already announced a
ban on Australian television programmes and advertising material. The
state-controlled broadcasting service would also broadcast only negative
views about Australia.
Dr Mahathir did not attend the Seattle meeting because he said Apec was in
danger of becoming dominated by the US and being turned into a structured
trading group like the European Union.
At the summit, Mr Keating, clearly exasperated at frequent questions by
Australian journalists about Dr Mahathir, said he did not care about the
Malaysian prime minister's position.
'I am sick of questions about Dr Mahathir. . . Apec is bigger than all of
us. . . Australia, the US, Malaysia, Dr Mahathir and other recalcitrants.'
In a subsequent television interview he hinted that demands for an apology
by Malaysia were based on feigned indignation and suggested that Kuala
Lumpur owed multiple apologies to Australia for various unspecified slights.
