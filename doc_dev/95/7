  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia will pay an 
official visit to Vietnam shortly. This event is taking place 
nine months after the visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. Here is our comment on the event: 
  The visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet in last year is considered a historic event in bilateral 
relations and so it will be the coming visit to Vietnam by 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. [sentence as heard] 
  These significant events taken place in less than a year 
prove that relations between Vietnam and Australia have reached 
a turning point in cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  During the last two years, the relations between the two 
countries have seen wonderful developments. In 1992, the trade 
turnover between the two countries was less than $2 million and 
the figure is 120 times now, reaching $252 million. At present, 
Australia is the sixth biggest investor in Vietnam with 23 
projects worth $2.65 billion. However, leaders of the two 
countries will wish to further develop bilateral cooperation, 
especially in trade. These wishes are likely to be achieved. 
  On his visit to Australia last year, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet reaffirmed that the Vietnamese Government welcomes and will 
create favorable conditions for Australian companies wishing to 
do business with Vietnam. 
  For his part, the Australian prime minister also affirmed 
that his country is ready to help Vietnam in transport, 
telecommunications, infrastructure, energy, and (?oil and gas) 
exploration. 
  It is expected that there will be new and positive decisions 
made during the coming visit to Vietnam by the Australian prime 
minister to make the bilateral cooperation and relationship more 
fruitful.
