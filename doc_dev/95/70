<F P=106> [20 April PASASON Editorial: "Steps of Development of </F>
Lao-Malaysian Relations and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai 
Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime 
minister of Malaysia, led a delegation of the Malaysian 
Government to pay an official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 
16 to 18 April. The Malaysian Government delegation was 
honorably welcomed at an official ceremony. It was also 
accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon 
and the multiethnic Lao people everywhere it visited. 
Noteworthy is that during the visit, H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir bin Mohamed and his delegation paid a courtesy call on 
H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, which proceeded 
in an atmosphere of close friendship. The delegation also 
visited various places of economic, historic, and cultural 
significance in Vientiane capital and Luang Prabang Province. 
  Official talks between a high-level LPDR delegation led by 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and a high-level Malaysian delegation led 
by H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed were held at the 
prime minister's office in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an 
atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. 
During the talks, the two sides informed each other about 
domestic situations, lines, and policies in their respective 
countries which they considered a firm basis for further, ever 
more vigorous development of Lao-Malaysian relations and 
cooperation in various fields, both in the state and private 
sectors, to bring about concrete benefits to the two peoples. 
The two sides discussed and exchanged views on various issues, 
including promoting investment between Laos and Malaysia, an 
issue in which the Malaysian side is interested. Following the 
talks, the two sides agreed to step up delegation exchanges at 
all levels. During the visit, a seminar on the foreign 
investment atmosphere in the LPDR was also organized. The 
Malaysian side also assured the Lao side of its willingness to 
render assistance in training Lao cadres. Part of the 
assistance will be directly provided by the Malaysian Government 
and the rest will be in the form of funds from a third country. 
Noteworthy is that the two sides have reached an agreement on 
repayment between the Bank of the LPDR and Bank Negara of 
Malaysia -- the central banks of the two countries. This 
agreement, together with the agreement on promoting and 
protecting investment which was signed in 1992, serves as a firm 
basis and marks a historic milestone for the further, ever more 
fruitful promotion and expansion of the existing good and 
friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and 
the two peoples of Laos and Malaysia. Another significant point 
is that the prime ministers of the two countries believe that 
Laos and Malaysia have maintained sufficient conditions to 
promote and expand relations and cooperation in all spheres in 
the immediate future as well as in the long-term period. 
  The multiethnic Lao people wholeheartedly hail the glorious 
success of the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation on 
this visit to the LPDR. The visit is considered a new step of 
development in relations and cooperation between the two 
countries. The success of the visit also serves as a basis for 
the two countries to increasingly promote, expand, and 
strengthen friendly relations and cooperation in various fields, 
which will thus contribute to establishing and promoting peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation in this region.
