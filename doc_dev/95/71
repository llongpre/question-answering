THE visit by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, to Indonesia
had an unsettled start yesterday when President Suharto reiterated concern
at foreign interference in his country's domestic affairs.
In a banquet speech last night, President Suharto said Indonesia would not
accept 'comment and criticism that only exaggerates the backwardness of our
national development effort and interferes in our domestic affairs'.
'Every nation and state has a level of dignity that is not open to
bargaining,' he said.
Earlier in the day, Mr Keating had met Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign
minister. Diplomats in Jakarta said Mr Keating raised the issue of East
Timor, the former Portuguese territory which Indonesia forcibly annexed in
1976.
Last November, up to 180 civilians were killed in East Timor when soldiers
opened fire on pro-nationalist demonstrators.
Australia recognises Indonesia's annexation of the territory, but diplomats
said that Mr Keating suggested East Timor might be granted special territory
status. He also questioned whether East Timorese nationalists currently on
trial should be prosecuted under criminal law for their political offences.
Such suggestions are likely to be viewed by Indonesian officials as an
intrusion in internal affairs.
In his banquet speech, Mr Keating adopted a softer line and said he
'respected Indonesia's determination to pursue an independent course in the
world'. He praised President Suharto for having 'dramatically improved
living standards in your own country, and contributed to wider regional
stability'.
Mr Keating's four-day trip, his first abroad as prime minister, has been
flagged as a move by Australia toward greater economic and political
co-operation with Asia. 'Each of us is the other's best test of how
effectively we will be able to deal with the social and political diversity
. . . which will mark our region in the 1990s,' he told President Suharto.
