MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said last night that he had
formally notified the Queen of his government's intention to sever his
country's links with the British monarchy and to create a republic by the
year 2001.
The announcement was made in Dublin where Mr Keating arrived after his visit
to the UK which culminated in a meeting on Saturday with the Queen and an
overnight stay at Balmoral in Scotland. It had been unclear whether Mr
Keating would formally declare Australia's intentions at Balmoral.
Mr Keating said: 'There is a long-standing convention that the content of
these conversations remain confidential. But I am able to say that I
explained to Her Majesty that, not withstanding the deep respect and warm
affection felt towards her by the Australian people, there was a growing
feeling that Australia should make the necessary constitutional changes to
allow the appointment of an Australian head of state.'
He said the move was seen as necessary 'to establish clearly Australia's
identity as an independent nation. I outlined to Her Majesty the various
steps that would be involved in such a process, including the need for a
referendum to approve constitutional amendments. . . the Australian
government's view was that if approved by the Australian people at a
referendum, it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by
the centenary of federation in 2001.'
Mr Keating said he had informed the Queen that in such a situation Australia
would remain a member of the Commonwealth and that Australians would warmly
welcome visits to Australia by the Queen as Commonwealth head.
Mr Keating added: 'Her Majesty authorised me to say that she would, of
course, act on the advice of her Australian ministers, as she always has,
and on any decision made by the Australian people.'
