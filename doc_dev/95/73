trade gathers pace

AS THE Uruguay round of talks on world trade liberalisation sinks deeper
into uncertainty, Australia's regional trading initiative, the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), is gaining increasing support from both
within and outside the region.
For the Labor government which sired the idea, Apec is starting to pay
dividends on two fronts. First, it is rewarding the gamble to grab the
leadership initiative in a region where most other countries regard
Australia as a suspicious white foreigner. Secondly, Apec is beginning to
look like it might provide an avenue for greatly liberalised trading between
the region and its major western trading partners, particularly North
America.
Apec was born partly of Australia's frustrations over the agricultural
subsidy war between the US and the European Community. Often caught in the
crossfire, Australia has sought to use whatever influence it had to get
other countries together and get an open multilateral trading system
working, even if only on a regional level.
Australia has suffered severely from the grains war, with the US infringing
on several of its traditional wheat markets, including China, Kuwait, Yemen
and Pakistan. As a result, its wheat export earnings have fallen from a peak
of ADollars 2.45bn in 1989 to ADollars 1.51bn in 1991, a decline aggravated
by droughts in wheat-growing areas.
Together with other non-subsidised agricultural exporters snared in the war,
Australia has formed the Cairns Group, which has played a key role in
getting the Gatt talks to focus on agricultural trade liberalisation. But
France's continuing intransigence over subsidies will now force Australia to
re-channel energy to Apec.
Apec was also born of a determination to get accepted as an integral part of
the Asia Pacific region, and thus get a better share of the bounty from its
dynamic economies. Despite its proximity, Australia has not really developed
strong trading relations with the region. This was partly because in many of
the countries, especially in south-east Asia, former western colonial
markets are very well entrenched. Australia also suffered from an image
problem: while geographically located in the region, it is seen to represent
the interests of the big white man. Australia itself has traditionally
enjoyed more comfortable trading with Britain and Europe.
Over the last decade, Australia has tried to rectify the position. Prime
minister Paul Keating, while still treasurer in the early 1980s, began
switching the government's focus from Europe to the Asia Pacific.
During his first term as prime minister, Australian business and government
for the first time joined forces to capture a larger slice of the lucrative
Asian market. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has enlisted
business support to produce trade and investment strategy in south-east and
north-east Asia. The strategies drew on experiences pf Australian companies
already operating in the region, and identified opportunities as well as
constraints in doing business in the region.
The trade department has also restructured its operations so that for the
first time, the Asia division is now bigger than the Europe and the American
branches.
The efforts have been well rewarded. In Vietnam, which has just opened its
doors to foreigners, Australia has emerged as one of the biggest investors.
Earlier this year, BHP won the contract to develop the huge Dai Hung
oilfields. The project, worth around USDollars 1.5bn, places Australia as
the second largest investor in Vietnam, next to Taiwan.
When Apec was first mooted in 1989 by the then Australian prime minister, Mr
Bob Hawke, it was greetly blandly by its polite Asian neighbours. Japan and
the US were even more guarded, unsure of how the new grouping fitted in
among the established institutions with which they already had pleasant
relationships, especially the Association of South East Asian Nations. Dr
Mahathir Mohamed, the Malaysian prime minister who had organised another
grouping, was outright suspicious of Apec. His East Asia Economic Caucus
excludes Australia and New Zealand.
But because of the faltering Gatt talks, the main mechanism for multilateral
trading, it seems that the previously most cynical Apec members now accept
that regional integration would be the best insurance against a Gatt
collapse.
The most dramatic turnaround was from the US. During Mr Keating's visit to
Washington last month, US president Bill Clinton threw his full weight
behind Apec as another link in the free trade chain, and as a vehicle for
locking the US into the region.
Importantly, there have also been strongly positive signals of Japan's
acceptance of Australia's leadership. The Ministry of International Trade
and Industry has said it was important that Mr Keating kept up the momentum
for regional integration. And the head of the Asian research arm of Nomura
Securities, Mr C. H. Kwan, has said: 'Australia has a big role to play in
this region. It is very difficult for Japan to play a leadership role
because of its relations with Asean, and Australia is in the best position
in the region to bring everybody together to discuss common interests.'
Apec has also achieved a political coup by getting the three Chinas -
Beijing, Taiwan and Hong Kong - sitting together as members.
With the members' growing receptiveness, Australia is poised further to
assert its leadership, not only of the region but also of a more permanent
body that would keep alive the region's hopes for continued liberalised
trading.
