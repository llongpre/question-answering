AUSTRALIA yesterday claimed to have won US support for proposals to
strengthen the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process by
establishing regular meetings of regional heads of government, writes Kevin
Brown in Sydney.
Australian officials said US president George Bush endorsed the plans in a
letter to Mr Paul Keating, prime minister and also supported the
establishment of a permanent Apec secretariat.
Mr Keating proposed upgrading Apec on a visit to Indonesia last month. The
plan was received cautiously by President Suharto, and is thought to be
regarded with suspicion by other south-east Asian nations.
Malaysia, in particular, has opposed Australian attempts to strengthen Apec
because of concerns that it might undermine the Association of South-East
Asian Nations (Asean).
Asean, grouping Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the
Philippines, is planning a south-east Asian free trade zone in response to
the emergence of trading blocs in Europe and North America.
Apec, launched two years ago by Mr Bob Hawke, former Australian prime
minister, was envisaged as a forum for informal discussion of regional trade
and development. However, the process has become an symbol of Australia's
increasing trade and foreign policy focus on the Asia/Pacific region since
Mr Keating replaced Mr Hawke last year.
Mr Keating has increased pressure on the US to keep a security presence in
the region. In recent talks with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, Mr
Keating supported continuation of US facilities in Australia, and offered
use of a bombing range when the US leaves the Philippines this year.
