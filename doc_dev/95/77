<LEADPARA>  Paul Keating was sworn in today as Australia's 24th prime minister, promising
to right the country's troubled economy but offering few clues as to his
strategy.;   The 47-year-old Keating succeeded Thursday in his second attempt
to oust Bob Hawke, who had led the country for more than eight years. Keating
was head of the treasury ministry until his first try against Hawke.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Keating is little-known outside world financial circles, but his profile is
likely to be raised when President Bush visits Australia for four days
beginning Dec. 31.;   The visit was scheduled, in part, to thank Australia for
its support in the Persian Gulf war. Hawke and Bush, two old friends, also
planned to play a round of golf together.;   "The foreign policy of the United
States has not been and will not be set on individuals -- it's set on
conditions, historically good relationships between countries. So I look
forward to dealing with the new government," Bush said Thursday. "I've met Mr.
Keating, I know him, respect him.";   Australia has long been a strong ally of
the United States. The major recent friction between the countries has been
over agricultural subsidies. Australia wants all countries to remove such
subsidies, believing that Australian farm exports would be more competitive
under a free market.;   As a member of the Cabinet, Keating had encouraged
Washington as well as the European Community to drop its subsidies. Otherwise,
his economic strategy is unclear.;   He promised today to undertake a plan to
kick-start the lethargic economy, plagued by high interest rates and
10.5-percent unemployment.;   Although he gave no details of his plan, he is
expected to move to lower interest rates.;   The Hawke government, of which
Keating was part, raised interest rates in 1988 and 1989 to help curb spending
and slow down the economy. The country went into a recession early last year,
and although interest rates have been brought down -- to 12.5 percent for home
loans, for instance -- many Australian companies have not been able to cope
with the downturn.  </TEXT>
