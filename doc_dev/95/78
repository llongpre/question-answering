ANZ is expected to become the first Australian bank to open a branch in
China since the 1949 revolution.
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is due to announce that ANZ
has won approval to establish a branch in Shanghai when he visits China
later this month. Mr Keating is anxious to make commercial relations the
focus of his tour.
ANZ, which has maintained a representative office in Beijing since the
1980s, applied last year to establish a presence in China's biggest
industrial city. Official approval is being advanced to coincide with Mr
Keating's visit.
The Australian prime minister will also announce a ADollars 40m (USDollars
26.9m) chocolate-making joint venture, involving Cadbury Australia and the
Beijing Agricultural Industries Corporation, in what will be the biggest
foray by an Australian-based company into China's food-processing sector.
In Shanghai, Mr Keating will also lay the foundation stone for a new
Foster's brewing plant which is being established in partnership with the
local Huaguang brewery.
BTR Nylex is upgrading a glass-bottling plant in Shanghai that is expected
to supply containers to the Foster's-Huaguang joint venture.
ANZ's decision to establish a foothold in Shanghai seems certain to increase
pressure on other Australian banks to follow suit, but China is not rushing
to approve new licenses.
Foreign banks already present in Shanghai include Bank of America, Citibank
and Banque National de Paris.
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and Standard Chartered Bank maintained a
presence in the port city even during the gloomiest days of the
post-revolution period.
Australian investment in China totalled USDollars 228m in 1992 and should
exceed USDollars 350m by the end of this year.
