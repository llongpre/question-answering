prime minister's first official overseas trip

MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, arrives in Jakarta today on his
first official overseas trip, hoping to promote trade links and cement
relations with Australia's increasingly prosperous northern neighbour. To do
so, he will have to walk a tightrope between two cultures - showing
sufficient concern about human rights to satisfy voluble domestic critics,
while avoiding an embarrassing rupture with President Suharto, his sometimes
volatile host.
Evidence of the inherent difficulties appeared at the weekend in the shape
of wooden crosses planted outside Indonesia's Canberra embassy, in memory of
124 East Timorese allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in November. The
crosses are deeply embarrassing to the Australian government, which obtained
a court order to end a similar demonstration in January, and later changed
the law to try to prevent a repetition. But the demonstration reflects
continued public concern about Indonesia's treatment of minorities,
especially in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed in 1976, and
Irian Jaya, formerly Dutch New Guinea.
To Mr Keating's discomfort, it also highlights a contrast between
Australia's tradition of robust public debate and the government's desire
not to irritate President Suharto, who came to power in 1967. Indonesia is
notoriously touchy about foreign criticism of its internal affairs,
especially from Australia. In 1986, for example, bilateral relations were
frozen after the Sydney Morning Herald suggested the president's family was
involved in corrupt business dealings.
However, the relationship has improved significantly in the last five years,
partly because of a close personal friendship between Senator Gareth Evans,
the Australian foreign minister, and Ali Alatas, his Indonesian counterpart.
The two countries worked together closely in the development of Australian
proposals which formed the basis of the United Nations peace plan being
implemented in Cambodia.
Indonesia also helped overcome regional suspicion, notably in Malaysia, of
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process launched by Mr Bob
Hawke, the former Australian prime minister.
Possibly the most important breakthrough came last year, when the two
countries signed an agreement allowing oil exploration and production in
disputed areas of the Timor Sea.
Several Australian states have also developed contacts with Indonesian
provinces, and Mrs Carmen Lawrence, premier of Western Australia, will be in
Surabaya on Thursday when Mr Keating opens a state government office there.
Much of the increased interest in Indonesia is being driven by Canberra's
attempts to carve out an Asian future for Australia, in deference to
geographic realities and the waning of traditional links with Europe.
Australians are also waking up to the material progress being made by
Indonesia, which achieved annual economic growth of more than 6 per cent
through most of the 1980s, and now boasts GDP of USDollars 100bn (Pounds
56.4bn), which is more than a third of the Australian level.
So far Australian exports have been largely restricted to commodities such
as oil, wheat and cotton, while Indonesia sells petroleum products, textiles
and oil to Australia. But bilateral trade surged by 27 per cent to USDollars
2.3bn last year, making Indonesia Australia's ninth largest trading partner.
Aggregate Australian investment in Indonesia totals about ADollars 1bn, but
most is focused on a handful of mining projects. Mr Philip Flood, the
Australian ambassador to Jakarta, admits that Indonesia's potential is not
sufficiently well known in Australia. Mr Keating will try to redress that
problem by stressing the progress which has been made in negotiations on
putative agreements on double taxation, fisheries co-operation and
investment regulations.
But his main concern will be to try to build on evidence that Indonesia's
political culture is maturing sufficiently to allow its relationship with
Canberra to withstand the shock of events such as the massacre in East
Timor.
Jakarta has responded with noticeable restraint to Australian criticism of
the shootings, and the Indonesian military reacted cautiously last month to
attempts by a 'peace boat', carrying demonstrators, media and politicians,
to sail from Darwin to East Timor without permission.
Australia has sought to play down the massacre by focusing on Indonesia's
'credible' establishment of a government inquiry which concluded that 50
people had died, rather than 19, as the army claimed. Canberra's view is
that the report shows the massacre did not happen as a result of government
policy - a formula which will allow Mr Keating to deprecate the killings
without being forced to endorse domestic criticism of the Indonesian
government.
Mr Keating has made clear, for example, that he will resist pressure from
the Australian Council for Overseas Aid to seek Indonesian pledges on human
rights in return for Australian aid, which last year totalled ADollars 114m.
Officials say the prime minister has taken to heart advice from Mr Richard
Woolcott, the recently retired head of the foreign affairs department, to
avoid annoying the Indonesians with 'excessive self-righteous moralising'.
Mr Woolcott, one of the architects of Australia's Asian policy, warned
recently that nothing annoys Asian leaders more than interference in their
domestic affairs by Australia, which many regard as 'uncouth, lazy,
self-satisfied and unwilling to make the effort to understand them and their
societies'.
Mr Keating's difficult task will be helped by President Suharto's pleasure
in his choice of Jakarta for his first foreign trip, rather than the more
traditional destinations of London or Washington - a decision which also
underlines the changing priorities of Australia.
Nevertheless, he will have to perform a delicate balancing act if he is to
leave Indonesia on Thursday with both the bilateral relationship and his
domestic reputation intact.
