<LEADPARA>  Prime Minister Bob Hawke, his popularity plummeting after eight years in power
amid the worst unemployment since World War II, was deposed today by his
former treasury minister in a party vote.;   Paul Keating's victory was the
culmination of two years of bitter rivalry between Australia's two most
powerful and charismatic politicians.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Hawke, challenged before by Keating, had called a special meeting of the
Labor Party's 110-member parliamentary caucus to decide the leadership issue
-- which has split the party and divided the nation.;   Hawke then resigned
and offered himself for re-election in a secret ballot. Keating, who quit as
treasury minister when he failed in his first challenge June 3, won the vote
56-51.;   "I will need the help of the Australian people, their patience,
their understanding," the 47-year-old Keating told a news conference. "I want
to go back to what we do best, and that's creating jobs.";   He'll also have
to restore unity and harmony to a party that has been virtually ripped asunder
by the leadership crisis.;   "I fought the good fight. The fight is over," the
62-year-old Hawke, the Labor Party's longest-serving prime minister, told a
news conference at which he congratulated Keating and vowed to support him.;  
"I leave the prime ministership proud of my accomplishments. The Australia of
1991 is a profoundly better place than the one in 1983 that I inherited . . .
more tolerant, more compassionate, more competitive," he said, sometimes
appearing on the verge of tears.;   "If this was 11 years ago, I'd be getting
pretty thoroughly drunk," the former world champion beer
drinker-turned-teetotaler said when asked his immediate plans.;   Among
Keating's first duties will be to host President Bush's Dec. 31-Jan. 3 visit.
Keating is not expected to change relations with Washington. Australia, the
region's most faithful U.S. ally, allows nuclear-armed American warships in
its ports.;   Calls for more forceful leadership had become increasingly
strident as the economy wallowed in recession. Figures released last week
showed unemployment climbed to 10.5 percent in November, the highest rate
since World War II.;   Keating, renown for his bitter debating style, launched
his bid for leadership by claiming Hawke had promised to step down as prime
minister after the last election in March 1990.;   Hawke recently fell behind
leader John Hewson of the opposition Liberal Party for the first time as
voters' preferred prime minister. The man who once boasted a 75 percent
approval rating has seen it plunge to around 25 percent.  </TEXT>
