  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his 
way to Indonesia for a two-day visit, refusing to say whether he 
will raise Jakarta's magazine bans when he meets President 
Suharto on Tuesday. Linda Mottram reports that Mr. Keating also 
used a final parliamentary question time prior to his departure 
to reassert his right to discuss his republican agenda for 
Australia while overseas. 
  [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating's visit will focus 
on trade as well as the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Forum] 
leaders' meeting to be held in Jakarta later this year. In 
parliament, Mr. Keating said the relationship with Indonesia is 
a high objective for the Australian Government. But, responding 
to opposition questioning on the magazine ban issue, Mr. Keating 
said Australia's concerns had already been voiced, refusing to 
say whether he would raise the matter with President Suharto. 
  [Keating] I am not in the business of saying to the leader 
of the opposition on the [words indistinct] what I'll say 
because it [words indistinct] before I say it. 
  [Mottram] Mr. Keating was also pressed by the opposition on 
his comments two years ago in Jakarta about wanting to see a new 
Australian flag. Mr. Keating again distinguished his right to 
articulate his government's policy on an Australian Republic, 
but he avoided reference to the flag. [end recording]
