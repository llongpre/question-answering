<F P=106> [Editorial from the 7 June PASASON: "Hail Success of the </F>
Visit to Our Country by Premier of the DPRK Administrative 
Council"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, 
prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], 
Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative 
Council, led a high-level delegation from the DPRK to pay an 
official, friendship visit to the LPDR from 3 to 6 June. 
Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation were accorded a warm 
welcome of comradeship and fraternity by Comrade Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and Lao people in all places the delegation 
visited. 
  During the visit, Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation 
paid a courtesy call on Comrade Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of 
the LPDR. The call proceeded in an atmosphere of profound 
cordiality and friendship. The DPRK delegation also visited 
various places of economic and cultural significance in the 
capital and Vientiane Province. Official talks between a 
high-level LPDR delegation of led by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon 
and the high-level DPRK delegation led by Comrade Kang Song-san 
were held at the Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane. In the 
talks which proceeded in an atmosphere of close friendship and 
profound mutual understanding, the two sides informed each other 
of the outstanding situations in their respective countries. 
They also expressed their definite intention to further 
promote, expand, and strengthen, ever more fruitfully, the 
friendly relations and cooperation in the economic and other 
fields. Noteworthy is that during the visit, the two sides 
signed an agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical 
cooperation between the Lao and Korean Governments. The 
agreement was signed in furtherance of the implementation of the 
protocol on economic, scientific, and technical cooperation 
between the two countries. The protocol was signed in Pyongyang 
on 10 December 1993 on the occasion of the visit to the DPRK by 
our Lao high-level party and state delegation led by Comrade 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon. Stipulated in the said 
agreement are various DPRK cooperation projects of various 
fields in the LPDR, such as the cooperation projects in the 
areas of agriculture, mining industry, wood processing industry, 
and the construction of hydroelectric works which will begin in 
certain provinces in the northern region and in the plain of the 
central region in the subsequent years. 
  The success of this visit to the LPDR by the premier of the 
DPRK Administrative Council has brought about new steps of 
development in the long-standing, good relations and 
cooperation, in particular in the economic field and between the 
parties, states, and peoples of Laos and Korea. The Lao people 
would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of the 
high-level DPRK delegation in this visit to the LPDR. The Lao 
people pledge to do their utmost to, together with the fraternal 
Korean people, contribute to fruitfully promoting and expanding 
and increasingly developing the existing good, friendly 
relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and 
peoples of Laos and Korea as well as to translating into reality 
the agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical 
cooperation. This will bring about benefits to the two peoples 
of Laos and Korea and contribute to promoting and establishing 
peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation among various 
countries in the Asia- Pacific region and the rest of the world.
