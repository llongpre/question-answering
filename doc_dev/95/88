MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, said yesterday that most
Britons would find it 'unexceptional and inoffensive' for Australia to sever
its links with the British monarchy and become a republic, write Alexander
Nicoll and Ivor Owen.
In a speech marking the 75th anniversary of Australia House, the country's
High Commission in London, Mr Keating sought to portray an Australian change
to a republic as a normal step for a nation forging a new identity in the
Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Keating discussed the issue over lunch with Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, who said afterwards that he would not be involved in advising
Queen Elizabeth II on the ending of her role as Australia's head of state.
It was a matter for the Queen and Australia's ministers and people, Mr Major
said.
The two premiers emphasised the warmth of relations between the two
countries.
Britain's tabloid press has interpreted the republican moves as an attack on
the Queen and has sprung to her defence, portraying Mr Keating as a rude
publicity-seeker. But he is expected to receive a warm welcome when he
visits Balmoral in Scotland today for private discussions with her.
Asked why he thought British people would support the Australian bid for a
republic, Mr Keating said a constitution democratically chosen would always
have the respect of a democratic people.
'So I do not think it is a matter of trying to put a dipstick into British
opinions, but rather looking at Britain's long-running respect for
democratic process and practices,' he said.
