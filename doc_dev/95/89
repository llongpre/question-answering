  [Text] At the invitation of SRV Foreign Minister Nguyen 
Manh Cam, His Excellency N.K.P Salve, Indian Minister of Power 
and acting co-chairman of the India-Vietnam Intergovernmental 
Commission for Economic, Trade, Cultural, and 
Scientific-Technological Cooperation [IVCETCSC] has arrived in 
Vietnam to attend the sixth conference of the commission from 14 
to 17 April. 
  During its stay in Vietnam, the Indian delegation visited 
President Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and his residence and office 
in Hanoi. The delegation paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet and held a working session with General Doan Khue, 
minister of national defense; Dang Vu Chu, minister of light 
industry; Tran Lum, minister of heavy industry; and Thai Phung 
Ne, minister of energy. 
  Minister Salve conveyed Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's 
greetings and kind regards to Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
briefed him on the results of the sixth IVCETCSC conference. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed his delight at the fine 
development in the relations of friendship and cooperation 
between Vietnam and India. He affirmed the close relationship 
between Vietnam and India and expressed the hope that this 
relationship would be strengthened and developed. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet asked Minister Salve to convey 
his 
invitation to Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to pay an 
official friendly visit to Vietnam. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Minister Salve jointly 
chaired the sixth IVCETCSC conference. At the conference, both 
sides reviewed past tasks and noted with pleasure the 
achievements recorded in implementing various agreements signed 
during the visit to India by General Secretary Do Muoi in 1992 
and the visit to Vietnam by Indian Vice President Narayaman in 
September 1993, as well as agreements reached at the fifth 
IVCETCSC conference. Both sides also discussed concrete 
measures and orientations aimed at developing all potentials in 
enhancing cooperation between the two countries. 
  The Vietnamese side welcomes and encourages Indian 
businessmen to invest in and enter joint ventures with Vietnam 
in medium and small- scale industrial projects such as the 
production of sugar and cement and processing of tea and rubber. 
The Vietnamese side also highly appraised India's assistance to 
Vietnam in the economic, scientific- technological fields, and 
in training cadres. It also expressed the hope that this 
assistance would be continued and expanded. 
  The Indian side pledged that efforts would be made to create 
favorable conditions for Vietnamese cadres and students to 
further their post-graduate studies in India, especially in the 
fields of economics, science-technology, and art and literature. 
  At the end of the conference, both sides signed a memorandum 
of agreement on economic, trade, cultural, and 
scientific-technological cooperation between the two nations. 
  On 17 April, His Excellency Salve left Hanoi for home, 
concluding his official visit to Vietnam with splendid success.
