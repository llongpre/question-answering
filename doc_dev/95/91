AUSTRALIA yesterday expressed strong support for Japan's rejection of
President Bill Clinton's call for a 'managed trade' regime to help reduce
the US trade deficit with Japan.
During talks in Canberra, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister,
told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese premier, that Australia was
'concerned' by the US proposal, which was rejected by Mr Miyazawa this
month.
Mr Keating told Mr Miyazawa that he admired his 'forthright and strong'
opposition to the US proposals, which Mr Clinton believes would reduce the
trade deficit by setting targets for certain sectors.
Australian officials said the two prime ministers agreed to oppose managed
trade, which Mr Keating fears would damage trade between Japan and third
countries.
Japanese officials said the talks made clear that Australia and Japan shared
a common view on managed trade. However, Mr Miyazawa said later that there
was no need for the two countries to 'get together to oppose the US'.
'I don't think the US will exercise managed trade. I told President Clinton
it would not be practical or good. All the countries in the Pacific are
against managed trade.'
The talks, which follow Mr Keating's visit to Japan in September, confirmed
earlier indications that Canberra is emerging as a close ally of Tokyo,
especially on trade issues.
Mr Miyazawa said the talks marked 'a new era' in relations with Australia,
which he described as 'an invaluable friend'. Australia is one of the few
countries to run a significant trade surplus with Japan.
The only difficult moment in the talks appears to have come when Mr Keating
raised the sensitive issue of Japan's closed rice market, which Australian
farmers want to see opened to imports.
Mr Miyazawa gave no ground on allowing foreign rice imports, but Australian
officials said he indicated that Japan was considering other market access
initiatives in an attempt to stimulate agreement in the Uruguay Round talks
on Gatt.
'Japan is determined to strike a positive stance on the problem of access to
the market,' he said after the talks.
Mr Miyazawa also said he supported suggestions by Mr Keating that the
15-country Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Process (Apec) could be
strengthened to encourage liberal trading in the region.
Mr Keating has called for solid progress at Apec's next ministerial meeting
in Seattle in November and urged a framework for harmonising trade and
investment rules and resolving trade disputes between members.
