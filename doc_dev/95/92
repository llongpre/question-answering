Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday ended a three-day
business promotion visit to Jakarta, reflecting his renewed effort to place
Australian-Indonesian ties on a sound economic footing after a history of
political differences.
Relations between the two have had a bumpy ride over the past few years
following Australia's criticism of Indonesia's record on human rights.
Mr Keating's efforts to divert the focus to economic issues have become more
urgent in the run-up to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in
November, which will be chaired by Indonesia. Two-way trade between
Australia and Indonesia hit rose to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) last year,
nearly twice its level of five years ago.
Mr Keating's visit coincides with Australia's biggest trade exhibition ever
 -Australia Today Indonesia 1994 - which is being held in Jakarta.
Although Mr Keating would have preferred to adhere to economic matters,
pressure in Australia forced him to raise the question of Indonesia's recent
press bans. Last week the Indonesian government banned two leading magazines
and a tabloid - Editor, Tempo and DeTik - in its most severe clampdown on
political debate in years. The ban came after the government had pledged to
foster more political openness.
Mr Keating said he expressed his regret at the press ban, which he said
'appears to conflict or at least contrast with the openness generally
occurring in the Indonesian economy'.
