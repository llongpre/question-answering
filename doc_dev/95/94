<F P=106> [PASASON 16 April issue: "Lao People Wholeheartedly Welcome </F>
Malaysian Government Delegation."] 
  [Text] In response to the invitation of His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin 
Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia, will lead a Malaysian 
Government delegation on an official friendship visit to the 
LPDR on the morning of 16 April. 
  In regard to this significant event in the relations between 
Laos and Malaysia, multiethnic Lao people throughout the 
country, as well as Vientiane residents, are very pleased and 
feel highly honored to have an opportunity to wholeheartedly 
welcome the delegation of the Malaysian Government. This 
official friendship visit to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime 
minister and his delegation follows an official friendship visit 
to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in early 
December 1992, during which the Lao and Malaysian governments 
signed agreements for the promotion and protection of 
investment; economic and science and technology cooperation; and 
air transportation. The three agreements serve as a very 
important symbol of the future relations and cooperation between 
Laos and Malaysia. Therefore, the visit to the LPDR by the 
Malaysian prime minister and the delegation not only shows the 
good friendship of Malaysian people with the multiethnic Lao 
people but is also a most important event in the history of the 
relationship between the two countries, which will become a firm 
base for the effective enhancement of bilateral relations and 
cooperation in the immediate future and in the long run and will 
be a new milestone. All this is to serve the interests of the 
two peoples of Laos and Malaysia and contribute to the continued 
efforts to promote an atmosphere of peace, friendship, and 
cooperation in the Southeast Asian region, as well as in the 
world. 
  Laos and Malaysia belong to same region, have rendered 
support to each other, and have shared good friendly relations 
and neighborly cooperation. Their peoples have similar 
characteristics and behavior. They love peace, maintain 
self-mastery and ownership of the country, enjoy independence, 
and admire progress and justice. They have never caused trouble 
for others. Neither have they interfered or invaded other 
countries. They have courageously carried out struggles with 
great endeavor and patience for a long time for the sake of the 
independence of their respective countries. 
  Malaysia is an active member of the nonaligned movement, 
having played a consistent role and taken an firm stance 
regarding the principles and objectives of the movement. 
Concerning this, the peoples of Laos and Malaysia have had good 
understanding of and trust in each other, and have thereby 
enjoyed good bilateral relations for a long time. Both sides 
have tried to promote relations in various aspects. In 
particular, after the visit to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Malaysian ties have improved more 
extensively and rapidly than before. 
  The multiethnic Lao people wish the official friendship 
visit 
to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation a 
glorious success, thus contributing to the further enhancement 
and promotion of the relations and cooperation between the two 
countries in a more expansive and effective manner. All this is 
for the benefits of the peoples of Laos and Malaysia, as well as 
for peace, friendship, and cooperation in the region and the 
world.
