  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating has pledged 
support for UN sanctions against North Korea. Linda Mottram 
reports: 
  Shortly after arriving in London at the beginning of his 
10-day visit to England and France, Mr. Keating released a 
statement on the North Korea tension. He has reiterated 
Australia's support for any action by the UN Security Council on 
the issue. He says it may still not be too late for 
negotiations, but Mr. Keating says increasingly it looks as if 
the UN Security Council will have to consider further action to 
indicate the depth of international concern.
