  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating says new 
report of further killings following the 1991 massacre in Dili 
in East Timor will be raised with the Indonesian Government by 
Australia's ambassador in Jakarta. 
  A British television documentary released this week claims 
many survivors of the Dili massacre were later killed by 
Indonesian troops as they lay in hospital beds. Mr. Keating 
says the Australian Government will seek further information 
from the Indonesian foreign minister on the claim. The 
Australian journalist, John Pilger, has claimed in a new 
documentary that a form of genocide has been going on in East 
Timor for 18 years. In the documentary called Death of a 
Nation, Mr. Pilger, alleges there were three massacres in Dili 
in 1991. Unidentified people in the film claim they were 
tortured by the Indonesian military. The film also shows 
footage of bones being unearthed from what is alleged to be a 
mass grave. Mr. Pilger said the film should provoke new 
condemnation of Indonesia and further investigation.
