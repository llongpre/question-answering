   Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. amid renewed calls to strive for the
goals of the slain civil rights leader.
   Marchers filled city streets in San Franciso, the Liberty Bell in
Philadelphia was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended
on King's hometown to join his family in Atlanta on the federal day
marking his 60th birthday.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,''
President-elect Bush told black leaders in Washington. ``He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   A unity march across the University of Michigan campus in Ann
Arbor drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's
carillon played ``We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil
rights movement.
   Later Monday, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young told a University of
Michigan audience that, ``The world King left is not a great deal
different.''
   ``But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the
solution to the world's problems, as we learned in Vietnam, as the
Russians have learned in Afghanistan, and as the PLO has learned.''
   Nowhere was King's influence felt more strongly than in Selma,
Ala., where he began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped
establish voting rights for blacks throughout the South.
   On Monday, three blacks were sworn in as members of the Dallas
County Commission in Selma. They became the first black Dallas
County commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member
commission a black majority.
   ``We bring home to Dallas County the harvest of the Martin Luther
King voting rights act,'' said U.S. District Judge U. W. Clemon, the
first black federal judge in Alabama, who administered the oath of
office.
   King's widow, Corretta Scott King, was joined by black and white
political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, once one of King's young lieutenants,
used the occasion to criticize the Reagan administration's civil
rights record and President Reagan's suggestion that civil rights
leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of
oppression among blacks.
   Jackson called Reagan's statements ``petty comments from the same
man who implied that Martin Luther King Jr. was a communist.''
   In Pretoria, South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, who is
black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that
will sit in a new U.S. embassay compound. The ceremony included
blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of South Africa's
system of racial separation.
   In the United States, parades were held in places like New
Orleans, Honolulu, Atlanta and San Antonio, where 15,000 people
marching from four directions converged on Martin Luther King Jr.
Plaza.
   ``I took part because Dr. King's dream has not been fully
realized,'' said Elbert Winbush, 32, of Oakland, Calif., who joined
10,000 others in the San Francisco parade with his three daughters.
   King would have been 60 on Sunday. He was 39 years old when he
was shot to death by a sniper in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968.
   King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in
1986, three years after Congress named the third Monday in January
as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day
as a state holiday. The six states are Arizona, New Hampshire,
Montana, Idaho, South Dakota and Wyoming.
   In Philadelphia, when black leaders symbolically struck the
Liberty Bell as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor W.
Wilson Goode cited the bell's famous crack.
   ``That crack is a symbol that there are some things
unfulfilled,'' Goode said.
   At the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, children struck the state's
replica of the Liberty Bell.
   ``He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He
tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said Sharonda
Gardenhire, 10, of Lansing, shortly after she gave the rope a tug.
   A speech by one of King's sons in Eugene, Ore., was delayed for
about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance
resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found.
   Martin Luther King III said that in the 21 years since his father
was assassinated ``this nation has made great strides.'' But he
added that, ``I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to
do.''
