   Worshipers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in Atlanta was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams, stood in
front of an Atlanta housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of King's dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, King's field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
David Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's
first elected black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, as he pounded three times with his fist on the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon.
   In New Hampshire, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 Merrimack Valley High School pupils walked
out of morning classes today in Concord to recognize Martin Luther
King Day, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
Mike Krumenacker, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, Arizona, thousands marched in
Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
Phoenix as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   On Sunday, Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the last year, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of Berlin and Beijing, Budapest and
Pretoria, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in Atlanta, more than 500 students and teachers at Booker
T. Washington High School joined civil rights leader Rosa Parks to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In Boston, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
October, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor Raymond
Flynn.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that Charles
Stuart himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor Flynn should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said Sadiki Kambon, director of a group called the
Community for Human Rights.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (October) night and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' Kambon
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in Mission Hill and the entire city.''
   In New York, Dinkins told about 400 people at Judson Memorial
Church that ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in Saturday, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' on Sunday that a black could occupy the White
House ``in our time.''
   In Seattle, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president and co-founder of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, addressed 900 people
Saturday night.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' Lowery said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of Martin
Luther King demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.
