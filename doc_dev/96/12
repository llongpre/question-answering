   A deputy has been assigned to provide security
for the family of Martin Luther King Jr. for the past five months,
a measure defended by the county sheriff as a valid use of tax
money.
   ``I'd say it's public money going to protect a public family,''
Fulton County Sheriff Richard Lankford was quoted as saying in
today's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. ``Anything that
happened to the King family at this juncture would become
international.''
   King was assassinated April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. His
mother, Alberta King, was shot to death in 1975 while playing the
organ for a Sunday service in an Atlanta church.
   ``It would be an indictment, I think, against our community if
another tragedy would befall the family,'' the sheriff said in
acknowledging he assigned deputy Angelo Willoughby to the post.
   The newspaper said it learned of the deputy's hiring through
county records.
   County Manager Sam Brownlee said the county commission should
have been asked to approve the assignment because it amounts to
publicly financed protection for a private family.
   ``That is not something the Board of Commissioners has
authorized,'' he said. ``That's something the sheriff has done.''
   Willoughby reports daily to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Non-violent Social Change.
   ``I don't know if I would say he's a bodyguard, but he's there
for the protection of the family as well as for the security of the
center itself,'' Lankford said.
   The civil rights leader's son, Fulton County Commissioner Martin
Luther King III, said he appreciates the officer's presence.
   ``I carry the name Martin Luther King and that draws
crackpots,'' he said.
   ``A guy came up and approached my mother (Coretta Scott King)
last week,'' King said. ``He was just crazy. If he (Willoughby) had
not been there, something might have happened. Once he saw a police
official there, he backed off.''
