   Thousands marched and prayed and church bells rang on the
birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., while
protesters demonstrated against states, schools and businesses not
observing the federal holiday.
   Three Ku Klux Klansmen handed out leaflets in New Hampshire,
fights broke out between blacks and whites in Louisiana and South
Carolina and racist graffiti was sprayed on signs on a California
highway named after King.
   King's survivors and others remembering him in services around
the nation said they harbored no illusions that his work was
finished.
   ``It's great that we celebrate his birthday but this day should
be a day where we recommit ourselves to finishing his dream,''
King's son, Martin Luther King 3rd, who was 10 when his father died
in 1968, told 500 people at a DePaul University church after
leading a candlelight march Monday night.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, spoke in Atlanta at an annual
ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband
delivered some of his most stirring orations.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on Dr. King's teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' she said.
   Security for the service was heavy following recent racially
motivated mail bombings in the Southeast. Bomb-sniffing dogs
inspected the church beforehand; visitors were required for the
first time to pass through metal detectors, and police took up
posts throughout the church during the service.
   Security also was heavy for a March of Celebration held later in
downtown Atlanta. Police estimated 400,000 people watched.
   A former top King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams,
complained that the parade trivialized the day and wasted money
better spent on the poor. ``This has been prostituted more than any
other holiday except Jesus Christ's birthday,'' he said outside an
Atlanta housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined Los Angeles' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in Boston. In
Memphis, Tenn., about 300 people gathered at The Lorraine Motel,
where King was assassinated on April 4, 1968.
   ``We didn't want the children to think that Martin Luther King's
birthday was just another day for watching television,'' said
Mardest Van Hooks, a Memphis teacher who helped bring a group of
youngsters to The Lorraine.
   The Washington-based Federal Holiday Commission said bells
chimed at 12:30 p.m. EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was tapped three times. The New York
Stock Exchange paused for a moment at noon.
   The holiday, first celebrated in 1986, fell on King's actual
birthday for the first time.
   In New Hampshire, one of four states without any form of King
holiday, students at high schools in Concord, Milford, Merrimack
and Wolfeboro staged protest rallies.
   ``Martin Luther King wasn't just for black people. He changed
everything for everyone, not just black people,'' Merrimack Valley
High senior John Morin, who is white, told fellow students.
   In Arizona, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a Phoenix crowd estimated at nearly 15,000 heard
lawmakers and community leaders at the Capitol urge them to vote in
a referendum this fall over whether to let a King Day observance
become law.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced Monday in the
Idaho Senate. Montana also has no form of King Holiday, while some
other states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways.
   About 200 people protested outside a bank in Buffalo, N.Y., that
stayed open. Norman Eenith, 35, held an outstretched dollar bill
and said, ``This is what it's all about.''
   In New Orleans, following a parade in King's honor attended by
tens of thousands, two whites were arrested after a fight in which
a black man was hit with nail-studded boards, officials said.
   At Garrett High School in Charleston, S.C., one of several area
schools that canceled the day off to make up for days lost during
Hurricane Hugo, about five black students angry at having to attend
school on the holiday assaulted two white students, Principal Rex
Whitcomb said. Police helped restore order.
   In San Diego, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,'' thought
to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' police said.
   In Florida, a county commissioner said he received numerous
telephone threats after he protested a newspaper advertisement
depicting King, a birthday cake and a garbage truck. The ad said
trash would be picked up as usual Monday.
   ``All of a sudden I recognized that I felt a particular fear
that as a young white man, fairly protected growing up, I had never
felt before _ what so many people in this group must have felt,''
Yordon said.
