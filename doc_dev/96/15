   Worshippers filling the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s church were admonished today to remember the slain civil
rights leader's birthday by rededicating themselves to his work.
   ``It is our hope and our desire ... that we will realize it is an
unending quest,'' said the Rev. Joseph Roberts, pastor of Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   Roberts opened the annual ecumenical service that attracted
local, state and federal officials to mark the national holiday
honoring King. Among those gathered on the podium were members of
King's family, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, actress Jane Fonda, Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris and
the state's senators and congressmen.
   Thornburgh called King ``a martyr slain in his prime while trying
to make America and the world a place where justice, freedom and
peace could flourish.''
   President-elect George Bush sent a letter to be read at the
service, in which he pledged that his administration ``will work
tirelessly for the strict enforcement of civil rights as well as for
absolute equality for all Americans.''
   In Washington, Bush commemorated the holiday with a glowing
tribute to King in a speech to about 300 prominent blacks.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' Bush told members of the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   Looking ahead to his inauguration on Friday, Bush said: ``What
becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us. We must not fail
him. We must not fail ourselves.''
   In South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins marked the
holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King on a bushy plot of land
in Pretoria where the new U.S. embassy is to stand.
   In Boston, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis invoked King's
memory when he announced an executive order that will bar the state
from buying goods and services from companies that have dealings
with the South African government.
   In Groton, Conn., 51 demonstrators were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct at the Electric Boat shipyard as they protested
the construction of Trident nuclear submarines. The demonstrators,
many carrying pictures of King and citing his belief in non-violent
protest, said the demonstration was held in observance of his
birthday.
   Elsewhere around the nation, planned observances of the King
holiday included the swearing-in of the first blacks on the Dallas
County (Ala.) Commission in more than a century. The ceremony was
scheduled for Selma, where King began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was to be symbolically tapped
today and church and school bells were being rung in Michigan.
Golfers were to tee off in a suburban Los Angeles tournament
benefiting King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   The observance at Ebenezer Baptist Church capped a week of
remembrance in King's hometown. At the church Sunday, King's widow
urged Bush to hold true to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation''
and to impose strict sanctions against South Africa.
   In addition, Coretta Scott King said in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' speech, the United States must do more by ``providing
education and economic assistance directly to black South Africans
who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' she said. ``But a kinder, gentler
nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   Mrs. King spoke before an estimated 1,200 people at the church
where King and his father were co-pastors. It may have been her
final ``State of the Dream'' address as president of The King
Center, a memorial and policy center in Atlanta.
   On Saturday, she announced that her 27-year-old son, Dexter Scott
King, would assume the presidency April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of
King's assassination at a Memphis, Tenn., motel in 1968.
   Today is the fourth year for the King national holiday. In 1983,
after considerable debate, Congress named the third Monday in
January as a national holiday honoring King, whose actual birthday
was Sunday.
   Most states also observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state
holiday. Among the few that don't is Arizona, where rallies were
planned in Phoenix and Tucson and where prospects are uncertain for
a measure that lawmakers plan to introduce this year.
