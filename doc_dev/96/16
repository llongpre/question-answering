<LEADPARA>  Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. and his commitment to peace was high on the
agenda of "Freedom Train" riders waiting at the Southern Pacific station in
San Jose this morning.;    "I'm coming to honor what Martin Luther King
represented," said Neil Cossman, 48, of San Jose, as he waited for the train
to leave for San Francisco and the annual celebration of King's life and
legacy. "I want to make a statement against the war, and I think this
represents that.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Until you end war, you won't end poverty, and until you end poverty, you
won't end racism," Cossman said. "They are all tied together. The things he
represented are being set back by war in Iraq.";    He added, "Every time a
plane goes down, the money spent on that plane represents I don't know how
many other lives lost to poverty, in addition to the tragedy of the loss of
the pilot's life.";    Dr. Amos Brown, pastor of the Third Baptist Church in
San Francisco and chairman for that city's program today, was in San Jose to
ride the train.;    Brown saw definite parallels between King and the war in
the Middle East.;    "King was a non-violent prophet-philosopher who took a
stand calling for the end of the Vietnam War, even when it was unpopular to do
so," Brown recalled. "I often heard him say it would have been morally
inconsistent for him to talk about freedom and justice for blacks and not be
concerned about lives in Vietnam.";    He believes the slain civil rights
leader "would have said we should have gone to the conference table to
negotiate a settlement. He would have raised some serious questions regarding
the fairness and justice of 25 to 30 percent of the men and women in the
Persian Gulf being black or other minorities. He would have seen this as a
fallout of racism and injustice in our nation.";    In San Francisco today,
several hundred people gathered in a poor neighborhood in a march to
commemorate King's birthday.;    Participants carried placards that read
"There has got to be a way to connect the human race," and other slogans
reminiscent of the slain civil rights leader's non-violent philosophy.;    "We
have come to Bayview-Hunters Point to affirm peace in our society and to deal
with our domestic problems -- drugs and violence," said the Rev. Cecil
Williams of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.;    "This is an
affirmation of what Martin Luther King preached -- pro-peace, not anti-war,"
he said. "We want to live peace. We want to stop the war.";    In Atlanta on
Sunday, King's widow, Coretta Scott King and others observing the civil rights
leader's birthday remembered him as an advocate of non-violence and urged an
immediate halt to the Persian Gulf war.;    "Our most urgent short-term
priority at the international level is a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf,"
Coretta King said in her annual State of the Dream speech Sunday at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.;    In Texas, Girl Scouts in a Dallas parade honoring King on
Saturday carried a 10-foot-long banner saying, "King's dream did not include
war.";    Today's holiday winds up 10 days of celebrations marking King's
birthday. Assassinated in 1968, King would have turned 62 on Jan. 15. The
federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of January.;    In the 22nd
annual King ecumenical service this morning at Ebenezer, where King and his
father were co-pastors, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said he was angered by
war-related polls showing that many white Americans believe blacks who oppose
the war are unpatriotic.;    "Let's set the record straight," he said. "The
ethnic group that has produced the fewest number of traitors in time of war is
Afro-Americans.";    Jackson noted that a large percentage of blacks are
serving with the U.S. military in the Persian Gulf.;    A rally honoring King
was scheduled today in Helena, Mont. Montana, Arizona and New Hampshire are
the only states where his birthday still isn't a paid state holiday.  </TEXT>
