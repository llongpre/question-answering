   Virginia's joint celebration Monday of the
birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights
leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is ``the perfect combination of
diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger.
   Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who as a state senator five years ago
pushed through the bill making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a Virginia
holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday
with Virginia natives Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson.
   ``I find no irony in it at all,'' Wilder, a grandson of slaves
and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since
Reconstruction, said Friday. ``It shows we are prepared to recognize
good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think
all three were men of principle.''
   James Farmer, a civil rights leader who worked with King, said
Saturday that King deserves a day all his own because ``Martin
Luther King stood alone as a giant.''
   But he said King would have been amused at being linked with
heroes of the Confederacy.
   ``Dr. King was very tolerant of things like that,'' Farmer said.
``If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.''
   The bill passed the state legislature in 1984 after seven years
of effort by Wilder and often acrimonious debate in public hearings.
   Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday
when favorite sons such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry did
not have their own days. Celebrating King's birthday on the third
Monday in January, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew
protest.
   King's birthday is Jan. 15, 1929. Lee was born Jan. 19, 1807 and
Jackson was born Jan. 21, 1824.
   ``The memory of Lee and Jackson is sacred to the hearts of all
true Virginians. To replace our heroes with Martin Luther King or
any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage
as a commonwealth,'' Forest Tucker, a member of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, said in 1984.
   But Wilder persisted. ``I have never taken to the floor of the
Senate to say one word against Stonewall Jackson,'' he told his
fellow legislators five years ago. ``I have never failed to stand in
honor of Robert E. Lee. But that cause which is sacred to many
Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.''
   Wilder, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor
this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In Richmond,
for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the
slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a
touring stage show performing works by black writers.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday in all states
except Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and
Wyoming. Mississippians honor both Lee's and King's birthdays on the
same day.
   Charles Sadler, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Federal
Holiday Commission in Washington, D.C., said his group doesn't mind
how King's birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday
is ``better than nothing,'' he said.
