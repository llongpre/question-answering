   The Idaho House approved legislation
Wednesday to make Idaho the 47th state with a holiday honoring
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The House voted 53-27 for the bill previously passed by the
Senate. Later, the Senate accepted a House amendment that made the
holiday's complete name ``Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
Day.''
   Final approval by the Senate was expected Thursday before the
bill goes to Gov. Cecil Andrus, who proposed the holiday.
   The bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the
legislature last week. Opponents said their constituents didn't
care about Martin Luther King.
   ``We're told this isn't a black holiday, but yet we're also told
we can't change the name,'' said Rep. Stan Hawkins, a Republican.
``If you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this, you're
making a mistake.''
   Rep. L. Ed Brown, also a Republican and one of the bill's
sponsors, said the decision on the bill would ``say more about
Idaho than .. about Martin Luther King.''
   ``Idaho is not the state in the Union that's going to determine
Martin Luther King's greatness,'' Brown said. ``Forty-six states
and the federal government have already done that.''
   Brown said adopting a King holiday would ``send a very special
message to future generations about how Idahoans feel about
minorities.''
   Besides Idaho, only Arizona, Montana and New Hampshire have not
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday
honoring King on the third Monday in January.
   The Idaho Legislature created a state commemorative day in 1987,
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a House committee last
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the
perception some have of Idaho as a haven for racists.
   Opponents said they objected to another day off for government
employees. Proponents said Idaho's economy would suffer through
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the
holiday.
