   Michael Dukakis, a day away from his party's
presidential nomination, invoked the memory of Martin Luther King
Jr. Tuesday and pledged to work to ``inspire and uplift this
country.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat and his designated running mate,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, received a tour of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center from the civil rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King.
   Earlier, Dukakis, his wife, Kitty, and adviser Paul Brountas had
breakfast in the candidate's hotel suite with AFL-CIO president
Lane Kirkland and his wife, Irena.
   Dukakis' aides, sensitive to accusations that labor wields too
much influence in the Democratic Party, did not list the breakfast
session on his schedule.
   An AFL-CIO spokesman called the breakfast ``routine.''
   ``I'm sure what they talked about was how to win in November,''
said federation spokesman Rex Hardesty.
   Dukakis was spending most of the day in his suite working with
speechwriter Bill Woodward on the address he will deliver Thursday
when he accepts the presidential nomination.
   He met for nearly an hour with the Democrats' Hispanic members
of Congress, a meeting they said Dukakis asked for. Rep. Albert
Bustamante of Texas said they talked about involving Hispanics in
the campaign and in the transition team, if Dukakis is elected.
   ``He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the
Hispanic community in Congress,'' said Bustamante. ``We were real
pleased.''
   While the convention wound up its debate on the platform,
Dukakis attended a closed fund-raiser in a downtown office
building. Accompanying the Massachusetts governor was his cousin,
Academy Award-winning actress Olympia Dukakis.
   The last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the
day with announcement that aides to Dukakis and Jesse Jackson had
reached agreement on most platform differences.
   With Mrs. King leading the way, Dukakis and Bentsen and their
wives looked at exhibits at the King Center.
   The first one they stopped at contained mementos of the passage
of legislation establishing a national holiday commemorating King's
birthday, Jan. 15.
   One of the exhibits was a photograph of President Reagan signing
the legislation. It included an inscription, ``To Coretta King.
With respect and high esteem on a very special day.'' It was
signed, ``George Bush.''
   The Republican vice president is Dukakis' certain opponent in
the fall election.
   Other exhibits included the key to Room 307 at the Lorraine
Motel in Memphis, Tenn. King was standing on the balcony outside
that room when he was shot and killed in 1968.
   The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to King, as well as the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded him posthumously, also were
displayed.
   The final stop on the tour was King's tomb, inscribed, ``Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. 1929 - 1968. Free at last, Free at last,
Thank God almighty I'm free at last.''
   In a brief speech that included several quotations from King,
Dukakis described the slain civil rights leader as ``a man of
action, he was a man of inspiration.''
   Bentsen was nearby, and Dukakis said that if elected he and his
vice president ``are going to do our very best, with your support,
to inspire and uplift this country.''
   Dukakis praised the convention keynote speech by Texas State
Treasurer Ann Richards and noted that neither he nor Bentsen ``have
ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory.''
   Then he added, ``And after Jesse gets through tonight, none of
us will meet the standard Ann Richards and Jesse Jackson set for
this convention.''
   Jackson was the featured convention speaker Tuesday night.
