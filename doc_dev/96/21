   The civil rights coalition Martin Luther King Jr.
put together more than three decades ago was having a foot-stompin'
good time in Ebenezer Baptist Church last week.
   Marchers from the movement's high time swayed and clapped to
gospel music. Movement royalty _ King's widow, sister and three of
his children _ were on hand for festivities that lasted until
midnight.
   But one person was noticeably absent: Dexter Scott King.
   He called himself ``the son of a son of a movement'' when he
became president of his father's memorial center, but left the
center in a huff four months later amid a reported power struggle
with his mother, Coretta Scott King.
   King, 28, the youngest son, has kept a low profile since his
resignation Aug. 4 from the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change. Neigher he nor his mother responded to
repeated requests for interviews.
   The King Center's directors emerged from a six-hour meeting
Wednesday with a new job for King, but they have not announced what
it is. King has given no indication whether he will accept the job.
   The directors have said the center's presidency will remain
vacant and they consider the matter basically resolved.
   As the Southern Christian Leadership Conference convened here
last week, there were several who identified with Dexter King's
position: that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in a
movement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control.
   Among them was U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a leader in the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s. Lewis,
49, said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago.
   ``The sit-ins and the Freedom Rides in SNCC were also a revolt
against the old leadership,'' he said. ``What made it different in
that period was we had been provided a role, and a place at the
table.
   ``You cannot take the dream ... to participate, put it in a
bottle and put a cap on it. We should open the doors, make young
people feel welcome.''
   ``One thing about Martin Luther King Jr. _ he welcomed the
involvement of young people,'' Lewis said. ``He praised the vigor
they could bring to a struggle.''
   Civil rights leaders, many of whom have acted as surrogate
fathers to King's children, said they are concerned about Dexter
King's welfare.
   ``I do plan to talk to him,'' said SCLC President Joseph Lowery,
a member of the King Center's board of directors and a longtime King
family friend. ``I think some mistakes were made on both sides.
   ``I think he's amenable to working it out. He loves the center
and I'm sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the center
does.''
   But another King aide, Hosea Williams, said, ``He ain't going
back in there.'' Williams said King left because the center's
leaders, by giving him the role of ``president-in-training,'' showed
they were unwilling to give him power to change things.
   ``They killed the boy's spirit. He sees now how costly it is, how
tough it is to be a true leader,'' Williams said.
   ``They talking about training. What kind of training does he
need?'' Williams asked. ``Old age is the inability to accept change.
And that is just the problem that Dexter ran into.''
   The Rev. Tony Minor, 30, could readily identify with what Dexter
King experienced.
   Minor, the SCLC's youngest chapter president, pulled together a
conference chapter in Cleveland, Ohio, that, after eight months, has
150 members _ mostly people under 35.
   A graduate of Martin Luther King's alma mater, Morehouse College,
Minor spent five years as an aide for Lowery and Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young, learning how to move his ministry into the community
and listening to stories about the movement days.
   Minor said the SCLC has made room at the top for youth before,
and he doesn't mind waiting for his day in the sun.
   ``The challenge is for younger leaders to respect and support
veterans who have been around,'' he said. ``Those veterans should,
in turn, adopt the young leaders, teach them, support them.''
   But Williams said, ``Young leaders must not back up or submit to
old leaders like me.''
   ``They've just got to come up and push old leaders on out of the
way,'' he said. ``Old leaders must realize ... we should voluntarily
allow the young leaders to take over and meet today's challenge.
   ``If we don't do that, then what we have suffered for will
perish.''
