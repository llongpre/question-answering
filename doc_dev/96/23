   Mayor Maynard Jackson and Martin Luther King
Jr.'s widow Friday urged Atlantans to ignore a Ku Klux Klan rally
planned at the state Capitol on Saturday.
   A white supremacist rally and march in downtown Atlanta a year
ago turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators gathered to
oppose a handful of white suprematist protesters.
   Jackson joined Coretta Scott King for a news conference
outlining events for the city's King Week celebration, which runs
Sunday through Jan. 15, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
   ``The Klan rally is not worthy of your attention,'' Jackson
said. ``Stay home, go shopping, rake leaves ... do whatever you do
on Saturdays. There's no sense in wasting your time on that. Leave
them alone, and let them say what they have to say _ to each
other.''
   ``That would be a good thing to do,'' agreed Mrs. King,
president of the King Center. ``It would be much better if people
stayed away.''
   Mrs. King said she and the center ``believe in the First
Amendment privileges of all people. But we certainly don't agree
with the philosophy of the Klan.''
   The Southern White Knights of the KKK plan a morning
demonstration at the state Capitol and an afternoon rally in
Forsyth County, the virtually all-white county north of Atlanta
where ``brotherhood marchers'' were pelted with rocks in 1987,
prompting a second march by 20,000 civil rights supporters.
   The Ad Hoc Committee Against the Klan has called this week for
counterdemonstrators to gather in opposition to the Klan. Police
plan to keep the groups apart, and the National Guard is on standby.
   Mrs. King told reporters that King Week events will go on
despite recent violence and threats against civil rights activists.
   The commemorative activities come less than a month after four
mail bombs arrived at civil rights and judicial targets in three
states, killing a federal judge in Alabama and a Savannah alderman
who was an attorney for the NAACP.
   King Week in Atlanta will include an ecumenical service at
King's old church, Ebenezer Baptist, and a parade down Peachtree
Street and historic Auburn Avenue, site of the King Center and the
civil rights leader's crypt.
   ``The precautions one should take _ we always try to take
them,'' said Mrs. King, adding that she was reluctant to draw
further attention to those responsible for the bombings.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said.
   Mrs. King noted that threats of violence are nothing new to the
civil rights community. ``There have been threats on my life ...
and, of course, my husband's life was constantly threatened.'' King
was assassinated in 1968.
   For the first time in the five-year history of the King federal
holiday, the Monday legal holiday falls this year on King's actual
birthday, Jan. 15. He would have been 61.
