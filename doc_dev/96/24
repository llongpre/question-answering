   The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent
Social Change has refused to confirm or deny reports that the civil
rights leader's 28-year-old son is resigning as center president.
   A source within the civil rights community, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that differences over how the
center should be managed prompted Dexter King and executive
director Barbara Williams-Skinner to decide to resign. The source
did not say what those differences were.
   Dexter King was named president in January and officially took
office April 4, the anniversary of his father's assassination,
saying he wanted to place the center on a solid financial base and
cut its dependency on donations.
   Messages seeking comment from King at his entertainment company,
Visionary Development Corp., and his home were not returned, nor
were calls to at least six King Center board members.
   The board said it would issue ``a definitive statement at an
appropriate time.''
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Ms.
Williams-Skinner was said to have clashed with Dexter King's aunt,
Christine King Farris, who controls the center's finances, over
budgetary and program proposals.
   The newspaper also quoted Mayor Andrew Young as characterizing
the reported resignation as a family dispute fueled by normal
tension between generations. Dexter King's mother, Coretta Scott
King, is the center's chief executive officer.
   Young, a lieutenant of Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s,
was among board members of the center who received copies of a
letter of Dexter King's resignation, The New York Times reported
today.
   City Councilman Hosea Williams, another former King lieutenant,
said the center recently had placed itself in competition with the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Martin Luther King
founded, for leadership of the civil rights movement.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. King,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' Williams said. ``When
they started talking about leading the movement, freeing black
folk, they started competing, and both got hurt.''
   Williams said center staff members told him of conflict and
asked for his help in resolving it, ``but I told them I wasn't in a
position to get involved, because people would interpret that as I
was anti-Mrs. King.''
