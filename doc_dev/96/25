   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has
decided not to serve as grand marshal of a parade honoring Martin
Luther King Jr. after some civil rights leaders questioned his
selection.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell said Friday in a letter to King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, that he felt his presence might detract from
the Jan. 21 event. He also said events in the Persian Gulf might
require that he be in Washington then.
   Some civil rights leaders had said Powell's presence could
create an awkward situation at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change.
   Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
is a longtime admirer of King and often quotes the slain civil
rights leader in his speeches.
   Mrs. King said she accepted Powell's withdrawal, adding she is
strongly opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Gulf.
