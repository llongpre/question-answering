   Educators gathered Tuesday to grapple with the
practical and philosophical problems that would confront teachers
in developing a kindergarten-12th grade curriculum on the national
holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``If we teach the principles of nonviolent social change to the
kids from kindergarten, what do we do when they stage a walkout?''
one educator asked.
   The answer, from Harold Sims of the Atlanta-based Martin Luther
King Center for Non-Violent Social Change: ``You have to teach them
the principles of non-violent social change, let them know that
civil disobedience was the last step following long period of
negotiation.''
   Teaching dilemmas, parental reaction, lack of course materials,
training and faculty support were some of the issues raised during
the mini-convention on ``Infusing Educational Materials Related to
Martin Luther King Jr., into the Curriculum of the Nation's
Schools'' sponsored by the Education Committee of the Federal
Holiday Commission and the King center.
   Committee members included National Education Association
President Mary Futrell; Sister Catherine McNamee, president of the
National Catholic Educational Association; Manya Ungar, president
of the National Parents and Teachers Association; Lawrence
Davenport, assistant secretary of the Department of Energy, and
Mrs. Christine King Farris, King's sister.
   Saying she hoped this would be ``the first of many,''
conferences designed to make available audio-visual materials,
training programs and other classroom aids, Futrell said, ``You
cannot simply go out and say `I'm going to teach about the life of
Dr. King' unless you know about his life, unless you understand and
have resources available.''
   Futrell said the purpose of the convention was to give the
participants an opportunity to come together and ``talk about how
we teach about King and how we inculcate that into the curriculum.''
   Many of the speakers discussed the problems associated with
their particular constituent groups.
   ``One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about
King,'' said Gordon Ambach of the Council of Chief State School
Officers.
   ``You have to recognize that an association like mine is _
predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, middle class and
suburban,'' said Ungar of the national PTA.
   ``The board members with which I deal ... are not reflective of
the greater society _ particularly that portion of society which
increasingly has problems getting their voices heard and their
agenda addressed,'' she said.
   She noted that her group was reaching out to other
organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, to help produce
literature by next June.
   The PTA board, which prepared itself through training in human
relation skills and a task force for inclusiveness, suggested that
the state and local chapters initiate programs which ``demonstrate
a commitment to the things that Martin Luther King espoused and
stood for,'' she said.
   ``To do this, the parents have got to educate themselves and
find out who Martin Luther King was,'' Ungar said. ``We hope to
have literature aimed at the parents, talking about how we either
overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach racism or perpetuate
this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.
