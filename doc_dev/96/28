   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered from the pulpit by
fellow clergymen Sunday as a man whose ``spiritual genius'' and
Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom.
   The official national holiday in his honor isn't until Monday,
but King was hailed in sermons and speeches Sunday, the day the
murdered civil rights leader would have turned 60.
   ``It's not just a one-day remembrance, but we need to remember
every day what he stood for and what he died for,'' the Rev. Clay
Evans, who worked with King, told worshipers at Fellowship Baptist
Church in Chicago. ``I think we have to make it not just a dream,
and not just make it a hollow day ... but a holy day.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, delivered her annual ``State of
the Dream'' speech to 1,200 people crammed into Atlanta's historic
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father were co-pastors.
   She urged President-elect George Bush to hold true to his call
for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' by imposing strict sanctions
against South Africa and providing direct financial support to
``black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in that
troubled land.''
   Mrs. King urged Bush to ``put behind the politics of the past''
by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable
housing, a stepped-up war on drugs and racial violence and the
appointment of federal judges ``who are as tough on discrimination
as they are on street crimes.''
   King, born Jan. 15, 1929, was assassinated April 4, 1968, at age
39 on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tenn. His killer, James
Earl Ray, is in prison.
   In 1983, after considerable debate, Congress approved creation of
a holiday to honor King on the third Monday in January. It was the
first holiday honoring a black American. The first official national
celebration was held in 1986.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday as well as a
federal holiday in all but a handful of states.
   Many cities and states planned their main celebration for Monday.
Bush planned to attend an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by
the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   King's birthday was to be observed at a number of other
celebrations in the capital, including a benefit and fashion show.
   In Michigan, a state senator was selected to ring the state's
Liberty Bell at the Capitol at 12:30 p.m. EST Monday. At the same
moment, bells at churches, schools and colleges throughout Michigan
will ring in memory of King. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, which
can no longer be rung, will be struck symbolically.
   In Selma on Monday, the first blacks on the Dallas County
Commission in more than a century will take the oath of office. It
was there that King began the historic 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But Sunday was a day in particular to remember King, who drew his
inspiration, his rhetoric and his philosophy from his Christian
faith, in churches.
   ``King was (a) man who was concerned about people regardless of
color and ethnic background,'' said the Rev. J. Allen Nimmo of the
Tenth Street Baptist Church in Camden, N.J.
   ``America should remember that Martin Luther gave his life that
we might live together,'' said Nimmo, who knew King and his family.
``The dream has not yet come true, but I think we are going to get
there. But we are going to have to struggle together.''
   Some who stopped to remember King this weekend had more personal
memories.
   ``He was a man who enjoyed a good laugh, missed his wife and
children when he was away, who got sad sometimes, who could be a
perfect friend,'' said Helen Maybell Anglin, who runs a restaurant
in Chicago. Another soul food restaurant of hers, the now-defunct
H&amp;H Cafe, which was one of King's favorite Chicago eateries.
   Even as supporters of King celebrated his spirit, some warned
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic. Others said that
racial bias is on the rise.
   ``There is a clear and present danger that the dream of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. is at risk of being derailed,'' the Rev.
Wyatt Tee Walker, chief of staff for King in the early 1960s.
   ``The establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us
into becoming comfortable with Martin Luther King,'' Walker told
worshipers at Riverside Church in New York City. He compared King to
Jesus and said King was ``the only authentic spiritual genius that
Western religion has produced.''
   Hazel Dukes, president of the New York state conference of
branches of the NAACP, said King ``would be very disappointed with
us.''
   ``He would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us
coming together, the races of people, Jews and gentiles, white and
black,'' she said.
   In a speech at a Harlem church to about 1,500 people, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson said that too many young blacks have a misconceived
notion of what their civil rights are. He chastised youngsters who
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs.
   ``That is a civil wrong. Dr. King did not die for your right to
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin. Stay the dream. Don't betray the
dream,'' Jackson said.
