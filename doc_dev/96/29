<P>
More than 20 years after Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon at 
Ebenezer Baptist Church, one of his daughters stepped up to the same pulpit to 
deliver her first as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional service Monday that drew more than 300 people, Bernice 
Albertine King, 27, became the second woman ordained at the historic church. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice King, the youngest of King's four children and the only one to go into 
the ministry, also graduated Monday from Emory University with doctoral degrees 
in law and divinity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most humbling moment for me in my life," King said. "I am not 
worthy of this high calling. No blood, no sweat, no tears could earn me this 
high calling."
