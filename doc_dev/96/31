   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged his
countrymen to be ``good corporate citizens'' in the United States
and proposed a broad cultural exchange between the two countries.
   Kaifu, the first Japanese prime minister to tour the Southeast,
also placed a flower wreath at the tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and met Thursday with the slain civil rights leader's
widow.
   ``He greatly admired Dr. King. It's only natural he would come
here,'' said Stephen Allen, public relations officer for the
Japanese Consulate in Atlanta. ``Japan is committed to human rights
around the world.''
   Coretta Scott King King took Kaifu on a brief tour of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and gave him
several mementos, said Steve Klein, the center's research associate.
   U.S. civil rights advocates were outraged four years ago when
then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said blacks and Hispanics
lowered the U.S. intelligence standard.
   ``He's a new prime minister. We can't hold him responsible for
what others have said,'' Klein said.
   ``The American Southeast has long had good relations with Japan,
and this region is today home to about 600 Japanese companies ...
(that) contribute to the region's economic development,'' Kaifu
said. ``I am hoping to have the chance to meet with some of these
corporate leaders, and I will take the opportunity to encourage
them to fit in with their local communities as good corporate
citizens.''
   In a speech Thursday night, Kaifu intended to outline a broad
cultural exchange project and encourage cooperation between Japan
and the United States, Allen said.

   In comments prepared for delivery at a dinner of the
Japan-America Society of Georgia, Kaifu said the United States and
Japan should focus on their similarities.
   ``All human beings are increasingly tied to one another as the
world becomes more integrated into one community,'' he said.
   ``Talks between our two countries should not be used as a forum
for one partner to criticize the other,'' Kaifu said. ``Rather we
should seize these opportunities to promote our joint endeavors.''
   He proposed a cultural exchange, called the Communication
Improvement Initiative, to promote understanding between the two
countries.
   Although he offered no specifics, Kaifu said the public, as well
as politicians, should participate in the exchange.
   Kaifu arrived in Georgia Wednesday night after attending the
economic summit in Houston.
