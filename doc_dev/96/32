   A month-long, multi-state journey that began on
the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. was headed for the city of his birth today to close with a
``Jobs with Justice'' rally.
   Thousands of civil rights activists, church congregants and
labor union members were expected to join the group of about 30
marchers at the afternoon rally at the Atlanta Civic Center,
organizers said.
   The pilgrimage, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference founded by King, started in Memphis, Tenn., on April 5 _
one day after a memorial service there in memory of the slain civil
rights leader.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the SCLC, said at the
outset that he wanted to draw attention to the plight of the poor,
which was a major concern of King's at the time of his death.
   ``We're trying to stir up the countryside,'' Lowery said.
``We're trying to bring people out to express their outrage about
poverty.''
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who was a close aide to King, was
scheduled to welcome the rally today. Among the scheduled speakers
were Lowery, Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Jim Hightower and a
representative of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change. Folk singers Peter, Paul &amp; Mary were expected to
perform.
   King was fatally shot on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in
Memphis on April 4, 1968.
   The pilgrimage, which started with about 30 marchers, has
included marches and rallies in towns along the route through
Alabama and Georgia on the way to Atlanta, King's birthplace. Most
of the trail has been covered in vans, with short marches at each
destination.
