   The younger son of Martin Luther King Jr. became
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his
father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's
60th birthday.
   Dexter Scott King declared that he, ``the son of a son of a
movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the
resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to
demand their share of the American Dream.
   For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home.
   But Dexter King is a quiet man with a small circle of friends,
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to
politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a
degree of reluctance.
   ``I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was
inevitable,'' he said. ``It surprised a lot of people, including
myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily
prepare for.
   ``I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not
belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a
choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's
role.''
   Dexter King's Jan. 14 appointment as president of The King
Center, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to
the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone
to take up the torch had been heavy.
   When Coretta Scott King made the announcement she pointed out
that Dexter, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led
bus boycotts in Montgomery, Ala., that sparked the civil rights
movement.
   ``Being the son of the civil rights leader makes Dexter uniquely
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a member of the center's board of
directors and a longtime contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr.,
said Dexter's selection showed ``we are moving forward, carrying on
with another generation.''
   King says he doesn't want to have to fight with his father's
image.
   ``I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes.
I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain
things you just can't inherit.''
   Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive
demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _
that went to younger sister Bernice _ but Dexter King does sound and
look like his dad.
   ``What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self.
And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and
become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ...
but not because people say `You're going to follow in your father's
footsteps.'''
   Larry Carter, dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International
Chapel at Morehouse College, sees Dexter King as a peaceful man who
will function well as president of the center. ``He seems natural
for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very
polite, he's very considerate.
   ``He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister Bernice, but he's
capable of passion and has believability.''
   Carter, who has known King for about four years, said he never
knew whether the MLK image was a problem for Dexter King; he never
let it show.
   King, who attended Morehouse _ his father's alma mater _ but has
not graduated, is founder and president of Visionary Development
Corp., a business and development consulting firm. He also directs
the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced
a record marking the first federal King holiday in 1986.
   King said he was first considered for president of The King
Center two years ago, when there was ``some talk amongst the board
members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children
into a leadership role.
   But Yolanda, 33, serves as the center's producing director of
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with Attallah Shabazz,
daughter of the late Malcolm X; Martin Luther King III, a retiring,
soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a Fulton County commissioner; and
Bernice, 25, is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology
at Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``At that time, I was not specifically targeted,'' King said.
``Recently, ... our immediate family more or less talked about the
fact that my mother is not getting any younger.''
   He explained that the changes, effective April 4 _ the 21st
anniversary of his father's assassination _ would ``free my mother
up and allow us to work as a team.'' King will manage the center's
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and
chief executive officer.
   Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting
young people excited about a movement they are too young to
remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and
non-violent teachings.
   Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial
base, he said, with an endowment ``that allows us to
institutionalize our work so that we're not just trying to hang on
day by day or donation by donation.''
   He hopes it won't be too lonely at the top.
   ``I don't know a lot of young national and international leaders,
but I will be thrust into that role. It is lonely, and it is
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who
can really understand where you're coming from.''
