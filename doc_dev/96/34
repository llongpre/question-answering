A HOLIDAY FOR ALL TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

This year, five years after Congress created a national holiday on Jan. 15 to 
commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, only four of 29 Orange County 
cities -- and the county itself -- have officially recognized the day and its 
meaning. At the rate additional cities join in, it will be well into the 21st 
Century before the holiday is given its just due. 
</P>
<P>
Congress made the birthday of the slain civil rights leader a holiday because 
he stood for justice and equality for all races. Those who lived through the 
days when King led nonviolent demonstrations to force the white society to come 
face to face with its own racism will never forget the role this eloquent and 
peaceful man played in national change. But, while the most virulent forms of 
racism have disappeared, there are still gains to be made for blacks in 
America, and in Orange County. As an indication of the non-acceptance of blacks 
here, their numbers have remained virtually stagnant for a decade, still 
numbering less than 30,000 of a population of more than 2 million.

<P>
Of course, Martin Luther King Day is not just for blacks. It also represents 
the struggle for equality of all people who come to America in search of 
freedom. In Orange County, this includes large communities of Vietnamese 
refugees and Latinos.

Last year, Seal Beach added Martin Luther King Day to its list of employee 
holidays. The year before, Santa Ana joined the cities of Irvine and Huntington 
Beach, as well as Orange County, to celebrate the symbolic day. During this 
coming year, other cities should join with them so that, well before the turn 
of the century, it is a holiday observed by all in Orange County.
