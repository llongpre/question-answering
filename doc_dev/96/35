   Civil rights leaders are demanding that the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy retract implications in his new book that the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had sexual encounters with women on the
night before he was killed.
   A Memphis, Tenn., woman said in an interview published today
that she was with Abernathy and King that night, and she disputed
part of the account in Abernathy's autobiography, ``And The Walls
Came Tumbling Down.''
   In his book, published this month, King's onetime top aide says
King spent parts of the night before his death alone with two
different women and physically fought with a third.
   Abernathy wrote that he awoke from a nap in a woman's living
room after a late-night dinner to see King and the woman emerge
from a bedroom. Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu told The Commercial Appeal in
Memphis that she was host of the dinner and that she and her sister
talked with King and another aide in the living room while
Abernathy, who ``had too many'' drinks, slept on her bed.
   In an interview published today in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Abernathy rejected suggestions by some of the
civil rights leaders that two strokes and brain surgery might have
impaired his memory. ``I am most surprised anybody would think I'm
mentally incompetent,'' Abernathy said.
   Abernathy has said that he did not include passages about King's
extramarital affairs out of malice, but felt he needed to address
the issue since it had been discussed in previous biographies of
the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   ``I loved Martin Luther King more than a brother. I would never
do it to injure him,'' Abernathy said.
   A coalition of black leaders including Jesse Jackson and Andrew
Young said Thursday they objected to the controversial passages and
doubted that Abernathy wrote them. A spokesman for the book's
publisher replied that the whole book was written solely by the
Atlanta minister.
   The group's statement concluded that ``the Memphis section'' of
Abernathy's book was so out of character with Abernathy's life and
previous statements that it must have been ``put into your mouth by
others who needed a sensational story to sell books and slander the
name of your martyred brother.''
   Steve Sorrentino, a spokesman for Harper &amp; Row in New York, said
the allegations are untrue.
   ``The book is entirely Abernathy's words. There was no
co-writer, no ghost writer,'' Sorrentino said. ``He stands by
everything he says in the book. I wonder if all the people sitting
back criticizing now have read the book.
   ``The book is not a sensationalized, `put down Martin Luther
King' book,'' Sorrentino said. ``He reveres Martin Luther King and
takes two pages to address what everyone has talked about before.
He wanted to address it and be honest about it.''
   Abernathy _ appearing to promote the book Thursday in Memphis,
Tenn., where King was slain April 4, 1968 _ said he was surprised
by the uproar.
   ``I'm not Judas,'' he told reporters. ``I know who I am. I'm a
Christian minister.''
   Jesse Hill, chairman of the board of The King Center in Atlanta,
said a number of civil rights leaders including Jackson, Young,
NAACP chief Benjamin Hooks and Southern Christian Leadership
Conference President Joseph Lowery, sent Abernathy a telegram
Sunday calling on him to repudiate his writings.
   ``We take particular exception to your personal reconstruction
of Martin's last hours on this earth,'' said the telegram, read to
reporters by Hill at a news conference in front of King's tomb at
The King Center.
   ``The Ralph we know and love would not have written this
section. ... We deplore the fact that, for this account, if it is
not repudiated, will rob you of your rightful place in history.''
   Jackson issued a statement that the character of King's work
would stand ``when all the dust clears.''
   ``Dr. King cannot speak for himself,'' the statement said.
``Those of us who appreciate Dr. King's work will stand with him
through every challenge.''
   Hooks, in a statement released from NAACP headquarters in
Baltimore, said he had read the book and was ``deeply saddened and
distressed'' that Abernathy ``would succumb to the temptation to
desecrate'' King's memory.
   King Center officials said King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
president of the center, would have no statement other than to
endorse that made by Hill, the center's board chairman.
   John Hurst Adams, an African Methodist Episcopal Church bishop,
said Young, Jackson, Hooks and former King aide Bernard Lee, all of
whom were in Memphis with King on his final days, have ``sharply
different'' recollections of the events of those days.
