<HEAD>Son of Martin Luther King Says Gays Have `Problem'</HEAD>

   A son of slain civil rights leader Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Tuesday told middle school students that gay
people have ``a problem.''
   ``Our population is really all kind of mixed up right now,''
Martin Luther King III said during a speech observing Black History
Month at Poughkeepsie Middle School. ``I mean, we've got a straight
community and a community we call the gay community. ... We laugh,
but that's real.''
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way. Any man that has a desire to be with
another man has a problem, in my opinion,'' King said. ``And that
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman.''
   King did not talk to reporters afterward.
   An official with a national gay rights group called King's
remarks ``strange and upsetting'' considering the increased reports
of violence against gays nationwide.
   ``The majority of cases are in fact perpetrated by young people
who really don't see anything wrong with anti-gay bigotry,'' said
Karin Schwartz, assistant director of the New York City-based Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
   ``His statements won't do anything to confront that belief that
many students have and, if anything, will bolster it,'' she said.
   Poughkeepsie is about 75 miles north of New York City.
