   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited the
tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and met briefly today with
the slain civil rights leader's widow.
   Kaifu and his wife, Sachiyo, stood together after he placed a
wreath of pink and red carnations, purple daisies and burgundy
chrysanthemums on King's grave.
   He made no public comments during the ceremony and reporters
were not allowed at a short meeting later between Kaifu and Coretta
Scott King.
   American civil rights advocates were outraged four years ago
when then-Prime Minister Nasuhiro Nakasone said blacks and
Hispanics lowered U.S. intelligence standards.
   Steve Klein, research associate at the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change, said civil rights leaders
appreciated Kaifu's gesture.
   ``He's a new prime minister,'' Klein said. ``We can't hold him
responsible for what others have said.''
   Kaifu was to deliver a speech Thursday night outlining a broad
cultural exchange project and encouraging cooperation between Japan
and the United States, said Stephen Allen, public relations officer
for the Japanese Consulate in Atlanta.
   Kaifu has made few public remarks since he arrived in Georgia
Wednesday night but told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a
written statement that ``the American Southeast has long had good
relations with Japan, and this region is today home to about 600
Japanese companies ... (that) contribute to the region's economic
development.
   ``I am hoping to have the chance to meet with some of these
corporate leaders, and I will take the opportunity to encourage
them to fit in with their local communities as good corporate
citizens,'' he said.
   Kaifu planned brief meetings today with local Japanese business
leaders as well as a private meeting with Georgia Gov. Joe Frank
Harris and Govs. James Martin of North Carolina and Bill Clinton of
Arkansas.
   He began his 37-hour visit to Georgia after attending the
economic summit in Houston.
