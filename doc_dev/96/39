   The ouster of Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, who
canceled a state holiday honoring civil rights crusader Martin
Luther King Jr., was cheered by hundreds at a banquet commemorating
King's assassination 20 years ago.
   Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery
announced Mecham's conviction by the Arizona Senate Monday at the
awards dinner that night.
   About 750 people cheered and applauded as the civil rights
anthem, ``We Shall Overcome,'' played softly in the background.
   ``I hate to rejoice,'' Lowery said, ``but I feel good about this
... We did overcome. Justice has been served.''
   Mecham was removed from office 20 years to the day that King,
who founded the SCLC, was shot to death in Memphis, Tenn.
   Mayor Andrew Young, an aide to King and an ordained
Congregationalist minister, reacted to the news with a Bible verse:
``Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.''
   In Altamont, Utah, meanwhile, where Mecham grew up, his removal
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances.
   ``It's just a dirty deal and Mafia-headed. He has just been
blackballed. I think it's disgusting,'' said his cousin Ona Rust of
Altamont. ``I'm very disappointed in the people of Arizona.''
   Mecham graduated from Altamont High School in 1942 and moved
away after joining the service in 1943. He is scheduled to address
the high school's commencement ceremony May 27.
   A former classmate, Beverly Fieldsted, who was one year behind
Mecham in high school, said Mecham's removal must stem from a
misunderstanding and the former governor is innocent.
   Mecham canceled a King holiday for state workers on Jan. 12,
1987, angering civil rights leaders and triggering a boycott by
some organizations that had planned conventions and by some rock
groups.
   He went on to anger blacks, Jews, women and homosexuals with
official actions or offhand remarks.
   Among other things, he defended the use of the word
``pickaninny'' for black children.
   ``I think Gov. Mecham exhibited insensitivity, a corruption of
spirit,'' Lowery said in an interview. ``I think it had to be a
corruption of spirit in order to insult Martin Luther King and the
birthday holiday which the nation wanted to honor.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, stood thoughtfully after being
told of Mecham's impeachment, and declined to comment.
   The SCLC dinner was held to present the group's annual Martin
Luther King Jr. Memorial Drum Major for Justice Awards.
