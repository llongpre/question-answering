<LEADPARA>  AS THE nation observes the sixth Martin Luther King Jr. holiday today, the war
in the Persian Gulf challenges us to examine his views on militarism.;    This
may be a difficult task for many Americans. As Dr. Vincent Harding of the
Iliff School of Theology explains, "The Martin King of 1963 . . . is a more
comfortable image for us all -- (he is) the triumphant Martin Luther King Jr.
of the March on Washington, calling a nation and a world to a magnificent
dream of human solidarity."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Yet, as Dr. Harding points out, the Martin Luther King Jr. of 1967 had seen
the prospects for fulfilling his dream shattered by the nation's deepening
involvement in the Vietnam War.;    On April 4, 1967 -- exactly one year
before he was assassinated -- Martin condemned U.S. military involvement in
the Vietnam War in a speech at New York City's Riverside Church:;    "A few
years ago . . . it seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the
poor," he said, referring to President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. "There
were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and
I watched the program broken and eviscerated. . . . I knew that America would
never invest the funds and energies in the rehabilitation of its poor so long
as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like
some demoniacal destructive suction tube.";    He expressed his deep
disappointment that the Vietnam War caused the United States to "increase our
troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt,
inept and without popular support.";    When Martin later stated that the U.S.
government had become "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,"
he drew widespread criticism, even from some of his supporters.;    But my
husband had told the painful truth -- for no other government had sent a
half-million troops to intervene on behalf of a brutal, corrupt dictatorship
that was thousands of miles from its own boundaries. No other government had
squandered many billions of dollars on the weapons of destruction while
millions of its own people languished in poverty, homelessness and
malnutrition. He warned that our intervention in Vietnam was a symptom of a
"far deeper malady" that would lead the United States into future wars. And he
called for a unilateral cease-fire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops.; 
  The Persian Gulf is not Vietnam. But Martin's criticism of the U.S.
government's proneness for military adventurism remains particularly relevant
in 1991.;    Today, we might ask ourselves the question he asked in 1967: "Why
has our nation placed itself in the position of being God's military agent on
Earth? . . . Why have we substituted the arrogant undertaking of policing the
whole world for the high task of putting our own house in order?";    Before
the war broke, the Center for Defense Information estimated that military
aggression against Iraq could cost taxpayers $140 billion in the year ahead.
It also is estimated that each day of war in the gulf will cost four times the
amount of our annual contribution to the United Nations.;    The human cost of
war will be even greater; 20,000 Americans could lose their lives, according
to one estimate.;    Military spending was out of control even before the
crisis in the gulf. When you subtract self-funding accounts such as Social
Security from the federal budget, our government is spending 55 cents out of
every taxpayer dollar on the military. This compares with just two cents for
education.;    Excessive military spending isn't just frustration for
taxpayers, it's a nightmare for those who depend on social programs. While we
can be thankful that the Americans held in Kuwait and Iraq have come home, our
nation's 20 million illiterate, 3 million homeless and 20 million malnourished
citizens still are being held hostage.;    As Martin said in 1967, "A nation
that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on
programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.";    Martin Luther
King Jr. challenged us to build a world free from poverty, racism and
militarism. Let us celebrate his life and work by rededicating ourselves to
non-violence.  </TEXT>
