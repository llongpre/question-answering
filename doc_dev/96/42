On the day honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., vandals spray-painted a 
swastika and racial graffiti Monday on California 94 freeway signs carrying the 
slain civil rights leader's name. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of California 94 was christened in 
King's honor Nov. 20, the letters KKK were painted across one of the signs on 
the westbound side of the freeway near the Lemon Grove exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two signs were painted with the letters SWP, which police believe 
stand for Supreme White Power, and with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about 9 a.m. 
on the east side of the freeway near Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
"We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. Fred England said. 
</P>
<P>
The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring 
Street exit in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Walker Smith, pastor of the Christ United Presbyterian Church 
and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You 
can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to King has been 
a sore point for San Diego's black community. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Board of Port Commissioners, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the City 
Council's request to name the convention center after King. The San Diego 
Convention Center opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four 
new signs on California 94. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, who led the convention center fight, denounced the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the 
elected leadership in San Diego has not taken a position on this. The 
leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should 
come out and condemn this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God on Imperial 
Avenue, was chairman of the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee, which was 
formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of the freeway after King is the last of several official attempts 
to find a place to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, the City Council voted against naming California 94 for King 
and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year 
later, voters rejected Martin Luther King Way and restored Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that battle, members of the Chamber of Commerce worked with 
black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in Balboa 
Park, which hasn't been erected. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, following the Port District's decision on the convention 
center, the Legislature approved renaming California 94 at the urging of 
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula 
Vista). But the Legislature stipulated that private donations be used to pay 
for the new signs.
