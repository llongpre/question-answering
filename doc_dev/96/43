   Martin Luther King Day won't be a state holiday in Arizona this year. 

   Yesterday, newly elected Republican Gov. Evan Mecham formally rescinded a state holiday for the assassinated civil rights leader. 
His predecessor, Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt, issued an executive order last May declaring Jan. 19 an official holiday for state workers. 

   Yesterday, Gov. Mecham, who took office Jan. 5, said he doesn't believe that the former governor had the authority to issue the proclamation. 

   A spokesman for Gov. Mecham said the state's attorney general had told the new governor he must rescind the holiday. 
The spokesman said that under state law only the state legislature can declare a state holiday for workers. 

   The spokesman said the former governor issued the order for "political expedience and to get national attention and to appeal to a particular segment of the population." 
Gov. Mecham suggested that the legislature pass a referendum to put the question on the ballot in the next general election. 
The Arizona legislature voted against making Martin Luther King Day a state holiday last year. 
Martin Luther King Day is a paid holiday for federal workers.
