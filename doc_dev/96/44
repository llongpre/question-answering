   Coretta Scott King has asked a judge to skip a
trial and immediately decide whether she or Boston University own
papers of her slain husband, civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr.
   At issue are 83,000 documents now at King's alma mater that
range from letters to Eleanor Roosevelt to the outline of his ``I
Have a Dream'' speech.
   A sworn statement and documents turned over by the university
support allegations that King never donated his papers to BU, Mrs.
King claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in
Suffolk Superior Court.
   ``It's kind of a shortcut in the case,'' said Archer Smith, Mrs.
King's Atlanta attorney, in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``The
letter is so clear. We're asking the judge to cut through the
jargon and everything else.''
   No hearing on the request for summary judgment was immediately
set. The case has not yet been assigned to a judge.
   Last December, Mrs. King sued Boston University to recover the
papers her husband gave to the school where he earned a doctorate
in theology in 1955. The suit claims the university has not
properly maintained the papers and is illegally keeping them. King
sent the papers to the school in 1964, four years before his
assassination.
   Mrs. King wants the papers kept with 100,000 more in his
archives at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change in Atlanta.
   In the request for a summary judgment, Mrs. King's lawyers said
that Howard T. Gotlieb, chief of reference and special collections
for Boston University libraries, had indicated in a deposition that
as far as he knew, King never designated any of the papers at the
university as an outright gift.
   The university also gave Mrs. King's lawyers a 1964 letter by
G.A. Harrer, then director of libraries for the university, saying
the university was interested in becoming the repository for King's
papers.
   Melvin B. Miller, a BU trustee whose law firm is representing
the university in its countersuit against Mrs. King, scoffed at the
latest volley from the other side.
   ``It's strange that they think there are no questions of fact in
this case,'' he said. ``Everything is to be settled. Nothing is
settled.''
   Key to the entire battle is a July 16, 1964, letter by King
naming Boston University repository of his papers. King was killed
in 1968 and did not leave a will.
   In the letter, King said the papers would remain his legal
property but that every year he would donate part of the collection
to the university.
   Mrs. King's lawyers maintain that while King sent papers to
Boston University, he did not take the step of making them a gift.
   The university in its countersuit claims it owns the King papers
in Atlanta as well as those it has because the 1964 letter made
Boston University the depository for all King's papers.
   Mrs. King's lawyers insist the letter did not constitute a
contract or charitable pledge and violates laws governing wills.
They have asked that the countersuit be dismissed.
