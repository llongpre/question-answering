   Mayor Andrew Young defended on Thursday the
assignment of a county deputy to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change and the family of the slain civil
rights leader.
   Atlanta also has a police officer stationed at the center as his
regular ``base of operations,'' Young said.
   Young said he was concerned that recent media reports have
``singled out'' the publicly financed security, and he described
the King family as ``a valuable asset to the city.''
   ``Whatever it takes to see that they function safely and
securely, we have an interest in maintaining,'' he said.
   Fulton County Sheriff Richard B. Lankford said last week he
assigned a deputy full time to the King Center to serve as a
``security consultant'' and to protect the King family, including
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and his son, Fulton County
Commissioner Martin Luther King III.
   Young, who was one of King's lieutenants in the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and is a member of the King Center
board of directors, said the city has contributed about $23,000 to
the center this year.
   ``I wish we could do more,'' he added.
   The King Center, visited by an estimated 800,000 people
annually, is one of the state's most popular tourist destinations,
he said.
   The city, Young said, routinely provides police details for such
attractions as the High Museum of Art and Zoo Atlanta.
   He added that the city also sends 25 to 50 officers to Atlanta
Braves baseball games, where they perform duties ranging from
security and crowd control to traffic direction.
   ``The King Center outdraws all of them, but it brings with it a
unique set of problems, and one of the problems is security,'' he
said. ``It's one of those kinds of places where the nuts seem to
gather.''
