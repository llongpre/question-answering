   The Arizona House of Representatives has approved
a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state
Senate.
   The bill, which would designate the third Monday of each January
as ``Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day,'' passed the House in a
35-24 vote Thursday.
   Democrat Carolyn Walker, the chief Senate sponsor, said there may
be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.
   ``I have a, shall we say, gut feeling that this may be the
year,'' she said.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who supports the King holiday,
issued a statement congratulating the House.
   ``I now appeal to the Senate for similar, non-divisive passage of
the King legislation so that I may sign it and together we can move
Arizona forward,'' she said.
   Former Republican Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached last spring
for attempting to thwart a death-threat investigation and misusing
funds, drew fire in 1987 for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a
move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that
had planned to hold conventions in Arizona.
