   Martin Luther King Jr. borrowed words and ideas
extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and
other writings without giving proper citations, a Stanford
University historian says.
   ``Several of King's academic papers, as well as his
dissertation, contain numerous appropriated passages that can be
defined as plagiarism,'' historian Clayborne Carson said in a story
The Wall Street Journal published today.
   The slain civil rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King, chose
Carson to lead the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which she
founded in 1984 to gather his papers from locations around the
country and produce a multivolume collection.
   Mrs. King's spokesman, Steve Klein, said today that she was
aware of the newspaper story but had no immediate comment on it.
   King's school papers are his most obscure and insignificant
writings, but the discoveries have prompted debate, anguish and
soul-searching among scholars who have worked on the project.
   Associate Editor Ralph Luker, a follower of King who was jailed
during a civil rights protest, said he suffered ``deep anxieties''
over the findings and ``many hours of lost sleep.''
   David Garrow, a member of the project's advisory board and
author of ``Bearing the Cross,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography
of King, said the discovery ``had a tremendously shaking, emotional
impact on me.''
   ``To me, 98 percent of what makes it most interesting is: Why
did he do it? Was he so insecure that he thought this was the only
way to get by? It's disconcerting, because it is fundamentally,
phenomenally out of character with my entire sense of the man.''
   The questions about his academic work surfaced in late 1987,
nearly 20 years after his death, when evidencewas discovered by a
Stanford graduate student who was working for the King Papers
Project.
   In some parts of the dissertation King wrote as a doctoral
candidate at Boston University, he lifted passages nearly verbatim
from other texts without using any quotation marks or footnotes,
the Journal reported.
   After that discovery, Carson told his staff to check the sources
of nearly of all King's academic work.
   It became apparent that throughout his seven years of graduate
school, King's essays, especially in his major field of graduate
study, systematic theology, often borrowed from other sources
without citing them as required by academic policy, the Journal
reported.
   When the problem was found, three project editors and a
half-dozen student researchers worked for nearly two years
annotating all of King's 150 or so academic papers.
   Carson said King likely did not intentionally do anything wrong
by sometimes failing to attribute materials in his writing.
   ``The best evidence for that,'' he said, ``is that he saved his
papers and donated them to an archive - at B.U. of all places.''
