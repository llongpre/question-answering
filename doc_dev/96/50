They marched Monday -- through the streets of South Los Angeles, down the 
boulevards of Beverly Hills, even to a small church in Inglewood -- to protest 
apartheid, to celebrate civil rights and, above all, to honor the memory of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been King's 61st birthday, and Southern Californians celebrated 
the work of the slain civil rights activist by parading down the Los Angeles 
thoroughfare that bears his name, protesting the racism that still exists in 
America and abroad, and effectively shutting down an institution that did not 
close for the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray skies hinted of rain, but police estimated that 70,000 people braved the 
chill air to watch the fifth annual King Birthday Parade, which began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, wound down King Boulevard and ended, 3.2 miles 
away, at the county Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words 'we shall overcome' go a long way. They're even saying it in 
Russia," said a smiling Ivan Jones, 73, as he watched his granddaughters march 
in the parade, which attracted a crowd more than three times the size of last 
year's. "It comes from Martin Luther King. Just keep it in your mind that we 
can do it, that we can overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a black governor, and it has nothing to do with the pigmentation 
of his skin," said Keith Strong, 36, referring to Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the 
newly inaugurated governor of Virginia. "It has to do with his ability. That's 
what Martin Luther King was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of marching bands and high school drill teams were many somber 
and poignant declarations of African-American pride. A woman sold "Do the Right 
Thing" buttons and carried a sign that read "I Love Being Black." Another stood 
in the cool air with a sweat shirt that declared, "I Have Come This Far by 
Faith," and a family baked a special birthday cake for Dr. King and sold pieces 
of it, and other food items, from their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this for his birthday," said Margie Manyweather, who spent a week 
planning and cooking the sweet potato pies, German chocolate cake and barbecued 
chicken her family sold. "What little money I make, I donate to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The image of another civil rights hero, one who has no holiday, also dotted the 
crowd. Gina Temple, 24, kept herself warm in a sweat shirt bearing a likeness 
of Malcolm X, while a vendor nearby sold T-shirts that showed Malcolm X and 
King shaking hands, over the words "Unity Is Strength." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, eventually, it should not be only King's birthday (that we 
celebrate)," said Donyielle Holley, 24. "It should be a day where we celebrate 
all black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Mayor Tom Bradley rang the City Hall bell as part of a 
nationwide, simultaneous bell-ringing ceremony in honor of King, about 120 
activists gathered in front of Security Pacific National Bank's downtown 
headquarters to protest a corporate decision to open more than 550 of its 
offices, despite the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that Security Pacific stood alone among banks, we thought 
they should be the focus of a protest," said Susan Anderson of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. "We are worried that 
the message many businesses and individuals will get because of Security 
Pacific's example is that the holiday is an optional one." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Lewis, a Security Pacific spokeswoman, said that "the sole purpose of 
the decision is to benefit our customers." She added that 20 branches did not 
open Monday, or later decided to close for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After the downtown protest ended, some of the participants drove to Beverly 
Hills to join more than 2,000 students and adult activists demonstrating in 
front of the former South African Consulate offices on Wilshire Boulevard. The 
group then marched along Wilshire to the current consulate on La Cienega 
Boulevard, where they staged a three-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers criticized apartheid in South Africa as well as the racism and 
inequities that they say still exist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Alfre Woodard, directing her words at South African President Frederik 
W. de Klerk, said, "You are dressing up that tired old whore, apartheid, and 
squiring her out to the ball . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And the shame is that some people in their drunken revelry are willing to 
dance with her, George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush, how dare you qualify freedom by the color of the people who seek 
it?" Woodard said to the audience that had crowded the steps. She was alluding 
to U.S. support for the social revolution taking place in Eastern Europe while 
ignoring similar struggles in Central America. "That is the dirty secret of our 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
A group representing the Nation of Islam used the holiday to protest alleged 
Los Angeles police harassment of blacks during a Jan. 3 fight between 24 
officers and 13 Muslims in the Crenshaw District. The incident began after a 
traffic stop and resulted in injuries to several members of each group and the 
arrests of all 13 Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come together in peace," Malik Muhammad, a member of the Brotherhood 
of the Black Man, told a crowd of about 100 at the rally in Leimert Park. "We 
don't have anything against the law. . . . They just didn't approach us in the 
right way, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders have accused police of provoking the disturbance by 
unnecessarily trying to force blacks to lie down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a meeting with police to discuss the concerns, the 13 arrestees -- all 
members of the brotherhood -- face possible felony charges, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Other holiday events Monday included a march in Inglewood that ended with a 
service at the First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Toni Morrison gave the keynote speech at the 
SCLC's 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Dinner at the Bonaventure.
