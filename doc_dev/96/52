   A woman filed a $10 million libel lawsuit Monday
against the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy and his memoirs' publisher,
claiming she is the woman he implied slept with the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. the night before he was slain.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit names Abernathy, who was an aide
to King; Harper &amp; Row, which published his book, ``And the Walls
Came Tumbling Down;'' and a Harper &amp; Row editor, Daniel Bial.
   The plaintiff, Adjuda Abi Naantaabuu, said the defendants
``falsely and maliciously charge, and caused the readers of this
book to believe, that she had engaged in adulterous behavior and
sexual relations with Dr. Martin Luther King on the last night of
his life.''
   Naantaabuu, who was identified as a beautician who also works in
the civil rights movement, claimed she has suffered great mental
anguish because she has been ridiculed and her reputation has been
injured.
   In the book, Abernathy wrote that he awoke for a nap in a
woman's living room after a late-night dinner on April 3, 1968, to
see King and the woman emerge from a bedroom.
   The book drew criticism from many of Abernathy's comrades in the
civil rights movement of the 1960s.
   Naantaabuu did not give her version of the story in the lawsuit,
but in earlier interviews has said she was the host of the dinner
and that she and her sister talked with King and another aide in
the living room while Abernathy slept on her bed.
   ``Everyone in Memphis knew that Dr. King had been at my house
the night before his assassination,'' Naantaabuu said in a
statement released by her attorney. ``Dr. Abernathy's book has cast
shadows on my character. Even my own granddaughter asked me whether
I had had an affair with Dr. King.''
   A call to Abernathy's office in Atlanta was unanswered Monday
evening. A spokesman at Harper &amp; Row also could not be reached for
comment.
