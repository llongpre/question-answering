   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s eldest
son told the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy that the former King aide's
book about his father was unfair, a newspaper said.
   In an interview Thursday to be published in Friday's editions of
The Tennessean, Martin Luther King III said he had spoken with
Abernathy following the dedication of the Civil Rights Memorial in
Montgomery, Ala.
   ``I told him I have always been taught to love people and I
still love you,'' King said. ``I said, `I think your treatment of
my father was unfair.' But I told him I loved him and I always
will.''
   It was believed to be the first time a member of the King family
had talked to Abernathy since the publication of his autobiography,
``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
   Abernathy, 63, was president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference from 1968 to 1977 and was King's closest aide
during the civil rights movement.
   He wrote that King spent the night with two women and fought
with a third in Memphis the night before he was assassinated by
James Earl Ray.
   Abernathy's account has been condemned and disputed by other
associates of King.
   After the memorial on the Southern Poverty Law Center grounds
was dedicated Sunday, King said he took Abernathy's hand and called
him ``Uncle Ralph.''
   ``What I was doing in speaking to him was in no way to express
any malicious sentiment. It was a concerned sentiment. It was just
human nature to speak to him,'' said King. He said he spoke for
himself and not other members of his family.
   Because of the negative reaction to his book, Abernathy was
excluded from the speaker's platform during the ceremonies honoring
King and 39 others slain in the struggle for civil rights.
   After the speeches, Abernathy rushed up the stairs and began
shaking hands with people on the platform. He and King spoke
briefly.
   Abernathy told The Tennessean on Thursday that King called him
``Uncle Ralph,'' and said Abernathy had embarrassed his family and
him.
   Abernathy said he loves Martin Luther King III, and said he will
be writing him and talking to him in the future.
   ``I will tell him that his father was my dearest friend,''
Abernathy said. ``I am a part of him. A part of me went on the trip
with him. He was my best buddy.''
   ``He was a human being,'' Abernathy said. ``He was frail, just
as all of us are. I want to tell his children that.''
