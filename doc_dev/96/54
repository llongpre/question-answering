   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy today he meant
only to tell the truth with his controversial autobiography in
which he says Martin Luther King Jr. had extramarital affairs.
   ``I held Martin Luther King in the highest regard,'' Abernathy
said at a news conference a week after news of the book made
headlines. ``He is my dearest friend, dead or unborn. I would do
nothing to harm Dr. King. I loved him dearly.''
   But Abernathy said King ``was not a Jesus, he was not a saint,
he was not an infallible person. I have told no lies.''
   In ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' published this month,
Abernathy wrote that King had difficulty resisting sexual
temptation. Abernathy, a King confidant, also wrote that the civil
rights leader spent parts of the night before his April 4, 1968,
assassination in Tennessee with two different women, and that he
then struck a third woman during an argument.
   Civil rights leaders, including former King colleagues Jesse
Jackson, Andrew Young and John Lewis, denounced the book last week
and demanded that Abernathy repudiate its statements. The said they
doubted he wrote the section about King's last night alive.
   In a statement issued to reporters today at his West Hunter
Street Baptist Church in Atlanta, Abernathy said his purpose in
writing the book was ``to focus attention once again on the civil
rights movement. ... I wanted to tell the truth and set the record
straight once and for all.''
   With King's private life already documented by historians, he
said he knew people would not believe his autobiography if he did
not tell the truth about King's infidelity.
   Abernathy said envy prompted fellow civil rights leaders to
denounce his autobiography.
   ``I think people are jealous of the fact that Ralph David
Abernathy has written a good-looking book and I was not supposed to
do that because they thought I was finished with the movement,''
Abernathy said Sunday.
   ``I may make some money for the first time in my life,''
Abernathy said. ``People are funny. ... I can name five or six
movement people who are now millionaires.''
   Black leaders also said in a statement that the revelations
about King's last night could rob Abernathy of his ``rightful place
in history.''
   Abernathy, 62, dismissed those suggestions after a service at
his church.
   ``You may be able to crop me out of a photo marching next to
Martin Luther King Jr.,'' he said, ``but you cannot take me out of
history, because I have earned my place.''
   The service took place with scarcely a hint of the controversy
generated by his autobiography and its passages on King's private
life.
   Abernathy, pastor of West Hunter Street Baptist Church, didn't
address his congregation. Instead, a guest minister preached in a
service honoring Abernathy on his 28th anniversary at the church.
   Several members of the congregation applauded when it was
announced that the book would soon be available at the church, and
that their pastor would autograph their copies.
   At Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was pastor, The Rev.
Joseph Roberts called on the congregation to boycott Abernathy's
book.
   The book already has gone into a second printing, adding 10,000
copies to the 30,000 copies ordered, according to Harper &amp; Row.
