   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy hit the airwaves
Tuesday to attack his autobiography's critics, questioning the
motives of those challenging his assertion the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. had extramarital affairs.
   Abernathy appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show in the morning and
the network's ``Donahue'' program in the afternoon.
   Black leaders, including other former King aides such as Jesse
Jackson and Andrew Young, denounced the book last week, calling for
Abernathy to repudiate passages about the slain civil rights
leader's personal life.
   Abernathy wrote that King had a weakness for women, and that he
had sexual encounters with two women and fought with a third woman
the night before his 1968 assassination in Memphis, Tenn.
   The critics also cited Abernathy's two recent strokes, and
expressed doubts he wrote the book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling
Down.''
   On ``Today,'' the 63-year-old Atlanta minister said Jackson
``was not honest with Martin Luther King. He wanted to fire him,
and I had to suspend him after I became the president of the
SCLC,'' the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   ``Martin was angry with Jesse because Jesse was always trying to
upstage and steal some of the glamour away from Martin,'' Abernathy
said on ``Donahue.''
   Abernathy said the criticism from his civil rights colleagues
``tells me that most of the black leaders in this country are not
concerned about the movement, the poor people, the downtrodden.''
   Abernathy suggested Young's motive for criticizing the book was
political. Young, the outgoing mayor of Atlanta, is expected to run
for governor of Georgia.
   Asked by ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel about three other black
leaders who have criticized his book _ NAACP executive director
Benjamin Hooks and Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Bill Gray, D-Pa. _
Abernathy called them ``good men.''
   ``All of these men that you're saying are good men have
repudiated the book and have a problem with it,'' said Gumbel.
   ``But they have not read the book,'' Abernathy replied. ``You
have to read the book in its entirety.''
   Hooks appeared on ``Donahue'' with Abernathy, and disputed
Abernathy's account that King had trysts.
   ``I cannot understand to save my life even if it were true how
he could say it,'' Hooks said.
   He suggested that Abernathy's ill health and pressure from
publisher Harper &amp; Row led to the inclusion of the controversial
material as well as what Hooks said were factual mistakes in the
book.
   ``If Ralph had been in control, he would have caught those
errors,'' he said. Harper &amp; Row has said the words in the book were
Abernathy's.
   After the show, Hooks and Abernathy embraced, laughing and
chatting.
   Earlier, when Donahue asked Abernathy about his health,
Abernathy got out of his seat, waved an arm and snapped his
fingers. ``I can do anything,'' he said. He also gave a rambling
account of an operation he underwent.
   Roy Innis, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, appeared
on ``Donahue'' to defend Abernathy, arguing that despite the
revelations in the book, ``King's stature is still as great.''
   On ``Today,'' Abernathy repeated his contention that he had
little choice but to write an honest account of King's ``difficult
time'' resisting sexual temptation because previous King historians
have addressed the subject.
   ``I wanted to make it look like Martin Luther King Jr. was
simply a human being, that he was not a god, he was not a saint,
but he was a human being, a mortal human being subject to make
mistakes and errors,'' Abernathy said.
