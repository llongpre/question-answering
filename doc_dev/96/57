   Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized
frequently in a college dissertation, but his standing as a giant
in the civil rights movement will not be diminished, a history
professor and other supporters say.
   Stanford University professor Clayborne Carson said Friday the
apparent 1950s graduate school plagiarism was a small blot on the
record of a great man.
   ``King's historical importance was based not on his work as a
student, but on his achievements as a leader of a social movement
that changed the course of American history,'' said Carson, whose
King family-supported project revealed the copied work. ``That
can't be taken away.''
   Boston University, where King went to graduate school, set up a
committee of four scholars to review King's 343-page dissertation,
``A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul
Tillich and Henry Nelson Weiman,'' which he wrote in 1955.
   School officials made it clear that even if evidence shows King
liberally borrowed from another student's papers without adequate
citations as claimed, the civil rights leader's legacy won't be
destroyed.
   ``The stature of Martin Luther King Jr., as the preeminent
leader of America's civil rights movement does not depend upon the
truth or falsity of the charges now being raised,'' the university
said in a prepared statement.
   ``...His great and lasting contributions to American society and
to humanity rest upon the life he made after he left the
university.''
   Coretta Scott King didn't immediately comment, but Carson said
King's widow was comfortable with the idea that his research
revealed the borrowed ideas and passages.
   She founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project in 1984 to
gather his papers from locations around the country and produce a
multi-volume collection. Carson was picked to direct the project,
which he said is now 16 months behind schedule because the past
three years have been devoted to substantiating the plagiarism.
   Ralph Luker, associate editor of the project, said the group
will insert all footnotes in King's works where they quote others'
material and write a separate paper explaining the original
omissions - a plan approved by Coretta Scott King.
   The questions about King's academic work surfaced in late 1987
when evidence was discovered by a Stanford graduate student working
for the King Papers Project.
   In some parts of the dissertation, King lifted passages nearly
verbatim from other texts without using any quotation marks or
footnotes.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday the discovery was kept
secret for three years, as it stirred much debate and anguish.
Several students working on the project wondered why the finding
should be investigated, some resigned, and at least one broke down
in tears when she found out.
   King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, was assassinated at
age 39 on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
