   Most people remember Martin Luther King
Jr. and the ultimate price he paid in the struggle for racial
equality. But few know of William Moore and his one-man march
against segregation. Or Emmett Till, who was shot, mutilated and
dumped in a river for speaking to a white woman.
   The creators of the nation's first monument to the martyrs of
the civil rights movement hope to change that, preserving the
memories of fallen heroes and inspiring young people to carry on
their work.
   The stark black Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated Sunday in
Montgomery, the ``Cradle of the Confederacy'' and the city where
King began the national movement for racial justice with a boycott
of buses in 1955 and 1956.
   ``I'm really thankful that he's there,'' said Mary Moore
Birchard of Birchardville, Pa., Moore's wife when he was gunned
down near Attalla in 1963. ``This is the first recognition Bill has
received in 26{ years.''
   ``I was just overwhelmed,'' said Mamie Till Mobley of Chicago,
whose 14-year-old son was slain during a visit to Money, Miss., in
1955. ``I knew it would be moving, but it's something where you
can't anticipate how you will feel.''
   Several of the 5,000 people who attended the ceremony broke down
in tears as they touched the cool water that flows across a
circular black granite slab engraved with a timeline of events of
the civil rights era.
   The slab, which bears the names of 32 blacks and eight whites
who died in the struggle, sits in front of a black granite wall 9
feet high and inscribed with the words King chose from the Bible
for his first speech of the Montgomery bus boycott: ``... Until
justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty
stream.''
   The $700,000 monument at the headquarters of the Southern
Poverty Law Center was designed by Maya Lin, architect of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
   ``It shows what did happen and what can happen,'' said Julian
Bond, Georgia's first black state legislator since Reconstruction.
``I think it's important that when you lean over to touch a name,
you see your own face reflected in the water.''
   Martin Luther King III, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said:
``It's a tremendous tribute that will be here through the ages for
those yet unborn. ... I look forward to coming back again and
again.''
   After the ceremony, King had his first contact with his father's
former confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, since the
publication of the latter's recent book, which portrayed the elder
King as having a weakness for women.
   Abernathy, who has been scorned by many black leaders because of
his book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' shook hands and
spoke briefly with his best friend's son.
   ``He expressed the fact that he was hurt,'' Abernathy said. ``I
told him that I love him and he'll understand someday, hopefully.''
   The Southern Poverty Law Center sharply criticized Abernathy for
walking onto the podium at the end of the ceremony and joining
hands with others singing of ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``His ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into
the fold of the civil rights movement after selling out its most
honored hero,'' it said in a statement.
   Though King's is the most prominent name on the monument, Bond
said it was important to remember other victims of what he called
``American apartheid.''
   ``Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a
Martin Luther King movement,'' he said. ``Many were ordinary,
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a
difference.''
   Others attending included Ethel Kennedy, widow of Robert
Kennedy; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat to a white
man prompted the Montgomery bus boycott, and Myrlie Evers, widow
slain civil-rights leader Medgar Evars.
   Hoping to use the monument to reach the young, the law center
published a magazine that tells the story of each person named on
the monument, and sent copies to schools around the country.
   On Sunday, 7-year-old Herbert Franklin touched the name of his
grandfather, Herbert Lee, a voter registration worker who was
killed by a white legislator in Liberty, Miss., in 1961.
   ``I've tried to tell my children how their grandfather was
killed,'' said Lee's daughter, Shirley Franklin of Kenner, La.
``Now they can see it for themselves.''
