<HEAD>King Center Confirms Resignation Of Slain Leader's Youngest Son</HEAD>

   Dexter King, the youngest son of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., has resigned as president of
the center named for his father, center officials confirmed
Thursday.
   The resignation had been rumored for several days because of
apparent rifts among the leadership of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change over how it should be managed.
   ``We regret to announce that Dexter Scott King has resigned his
post as president,'' said a statement from King Center board
Chairman Jesse Hill Jr.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill added.
   Hill's statement did not elaborate on the reasons for Dexter
King's departure, and neither he nor King immediately returned
telephone calls Thursday seeking comment.
   In January, the center's board of directors elected King, 28, to
take over the presidency from his mother, Coretta Scott King, who
remained as chief executive officer. He officially took over April
4, the 21st anniversary of his father's assassination.
   He was touted at the time as an ambitious young leader who
sought a vigorous role in the center, hoping to place it on a solid
financial footing and cut its dependency on donations.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said this week that there has
been conflict within the center's leadership over fiscal and
personnel concerns, and there were reports of a dispute between
King and his mother.
   Mayor Andrew Young, who was an aide to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. in the '60s, was quoted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution as saying the resignation was part of a family
dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   City Councilman Hosea Williams, who also was a King aide, said
the center recently had begun to focus more on leading the civil
rights movement, placing itself in competition with the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference founded by the elder King.
   The King Center, located on Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue,
once the heart of the black community's business district, contains
a museum and Martin Luther King Jr.'s tomb.
