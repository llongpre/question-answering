   Nelson Mandela, who refuses to renounce violence
for the cause of racial equality, arrived in the birthplace of
America's apostle of non-violence today to lay a wreath at the
grave of Martin Luther King Jr.
   Mandela emerged smiling and waving from his chartered jet at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. He was greeted by a
marching band and about 200 invited guests, including Gov. Joe
Frank Harris, Mayor Maynard Jackson and Coretta Scott King, widow
of the slain civil rights leader.
   About 100 people lined an access road nearby, hoping for a
glimpse of Mandela, who came from Washington. Security was heavy.
   Mandela quickly reminded Atlanta's civil rights leaders, some of
whom have gently criticized him for not renouncing violence, that
he sees South Africa's black movement as different from the U.S.
civil rights struggle.
   ``Unlike you, we are still under the grip of white supremacy,''
he said in a brief address at the airport.
   Mandela then spoke briefly to reporters, saying, ``Non-violence
is a good policy when conditions permit.''
   Mandela was scheduled to lay a wreath at King's tomb and then to
address an audience of civil rights activists at Big Bethel AME
Church. A later address at Morehouse College was canceled, but
Mandela still planned to address a sold-out rally at Grant Field.
   Mandela's schedule has been trimmed down to give the 71-year-old
leader more rest. He has been touring the United States since June
20.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the King-founded Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, hoped Mandela's visit would
inspire black Americans to ``see that we can overcome.''
   ``We think we have problems. He's overcome and I hope he lights
our fire,'' Lowery said.
   In turn, some civil rights figures hoped a first-hand look at
racial progress in the South would lead Mandela to try to avoid
violence in his homeland.
   Others, including King's widow said more attention is paid to
Mandela's stance on violence than to the South African government's
violence toward blacks.
   As chairman of the Mandela visit host committee, Mrs. King said
she hoped to show the African National Congress leader Atlanta's
``impressive spirit of interracial cooperation.''
   Civil rights leaders who worked with King during the 1960s
acknowledged that King's staunch policy of non-violence conflicts
with Mandela's stand, but they are sympathetic to the black
nationalist leader.
   In general, they say it is more important to free South African
blacks than to insist on doing it their way.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights veteran who has been
jailed 40 times, said: ``Without violence, we were able to turn the
South into a New South. Maybe being there will give him the will to
try, as much as possible, to avert violence.''
   ``If our experiences in desegregation can be helpful, we will
offer them, Lowery said.
   ``There are some differences in every revolution, but I have to
advocate non-violence. I've seen the results,'' said the Rev. Hosea
Williams, King's field lieutenant during the 1960s.
   ``I would tell Mr. Mandela to please study and evaluate the
teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. before deciding that violence
is the only way to bring about needed social change.''
