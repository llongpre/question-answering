   History placed Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr. on opposite ends of a philosophical spectrum but their
daughters have found a middle ground.
   Yolanda King and Attallah Shabazz are co-founders of a theater
company, Nucleus, which tours the country with its production,
``Stepping Into Tomorrow,'' a play with a stay-in-school message
for young people.
   They live on opposite ends of the country _ Ms. King in Atlanta
and Ms. Shabazz in Los Angeles. This weekend's performances at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change gave
them several days to get together as friends _ for the first time
in five years.
   ``Maybe we'll try to see a movie _ next week,'' Ms. King joked.
   Not everybody's father was one of the most important black
leaders of all time, one who led thousands with his own brand of
moral thought before being felled by an assassin's bullet.
   But that's the reality for both Ms. King and Ms. Shabazz.
   ``There's a bond between us because of the way in which our
fathers achieved their success,'' Ms. King said. ``Their notoriety
came through the people, the people being the least of these, the
left out and oppressed and exploited. So it's a different kind of
celebrity status.''
   The two men had vastly different views on ways to achieve
equality for blacks. King believed in black liberation through
passive resistance, and Malcolm X advocated violent confrontation
before he converted to traditional Islam and became El-Hajj Malik
El-Shabazz.
   But their daughters point out that their fathers did have one
meeting _ albeit brief _ in Washington in 1964. And Malcolm X went
to Selma, Ala., when King was jailed there, but prison officials
wouldn't let him visit, Ms. King said.
   ``The reality is that there was a real effort made to kind of
keep them separate,'' she said.
   ``I feel that there was a sense of brotherhood,'' Ms. Shabazz
said. ``I feel that there was an uncle in King for me.''
   The daughters met in New York in 1979, while both were trying to
eke out careers in the performing arts. They were introduced by a
writer friend who pointed out how much they had in common and
thought their getting together would make a heck of a story.
   ``After the guy invited us to do the interview, I said, `Oh
fine, sure. It is kind of coincidental that these commonalities
exist,''' Ms. King said. ``There was something there from the very
beginning.''
   But both were a little apprehensive.
   ``I was nervous. Just nervous, because this was Martin Luther
King's daughter, somebody famous, who is the child of someone you
admire,'' Ms. Shabazz said.
   ``And also a little concerned about what her impression of me
and my family might be, based on the perpetuation of how the public
always portrayed our parents _ Malcolm and Martin, at ends, at
odds, competing.''
   That interview led to offers to speak to young people, then the
creation of Nucleus. It also left them on the road, together, with
a lot of time to talk.
   ``It got rid of the formality,'' Ms. Shabazz said. ``We got to
hear about Daddy, not Malcolm or Martin. We got to hear about the
one ... who rode you on the back of the bicycle. It was moving for
us, something that kept bringing us together.''
   ``The fact that our fathers were assassinated ... puts us in a
different place in terms of the way people reach out,'' Ms. King
said. ``I think very few people could share that with me.''
