   Five students were suspended for defying
their principal's order to end an unauthorized tribute to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
   The students said they recited King's works in the Franklin
Regional High School lobby Monday because administrators failed to
observe the civil rights leader's birthday with a student assembly
or a day off.
   The five, who are white, also said the curriculum in the
predominantly white school system in an affluent Pittsburgh suburb
does not include black history. There are only 10 blacks among the
840 high school students.
   ``Martin Luther King did not work just to give blacks their
rights. He wanted freedom for all men,'' said Leona Wahl, 17, a
senior and one of the demonstrators.
   The high school observed Martin Luther King Day with a moment of
silence at the beginning of the day, and administrators asked social
studies teachers to mention King in each class, school district
spokeswoman Judy Johnson said Tuesday.
   An estimated 15 students skipped their second-period class to
assemble in the lobby for the King tribute.
   Principal Richard Plutto took them into the auditorium and gave
them a choice between returning to classes or accepting three-day,
in-house suspensions, Mrs. Johnson said.
   The five students who rejected the principal's offer were
suspended, she said. ``We were really trying to do our very best to
... kind of agree to disagree,'' said Mrs. Johnson.
   Miss Wahl said she does not regret being suspended.
   ``If they want to do that, it's fine,'' she said. ``So long (as)
we get our point across.''
