<TEXT>     San Francisco police Lt. Gerald McCarthy said late Monday that police had
no suspects in the slaying. Although three young men were taken into custody
at the scene, McCarthy said they were released after questioning.;    McCarthy
said an argument between two groups of young men apparently preceded the 2:15
p.m. killing. But he said it was unclear whether Miller was part of the
argument. Miller, he said, was shot once in the chest.;    Later in the day,
San Francisco police delayed the departure of two southbound trains while
searching the Martin Luther King Day Freedom Train for youths who had robbed
another youth of his coat at gunpoint.;    McCarthy said the robbery report
was not linked to the shooting at the Civic Auditorium.;    Capt. Michael
Yarov and a team of at least 10 officers escorted three young men into custody
just before 5 p.m. at the CalTrain station at Fourth and Townsend streets.;   
According to police, the robbery victim, who was not injured, got off the
train in San Francisco and told officials that a group of youths held him at
gunpoint and took his coat.;    The violence came on a day when people at the
rally repeatedly expressed the wish for peace so often echoed by King.;    At
the day's start, at the Cahill Station in San Jose, the air was charged with
enthusiasm and anticipation as thousands gathered to board the sixth annual
Freedom Train bound for San Francisco and a celebration of King's birthday.;  
 "I'm here because this is one way I can find out about my culture," said
Malinda West, a senior at St. Andrew High.;    Among the estimated 5,000
aboard the train was 11-year-old Jimmy Cates, a sixth-grader from Bret Harte
Junior High School in San Jose who had recently written a biography on the
civil rights leader.;    "I want to hear people talk about Dr. King," he
said.;    It was the fifth Freedom Train ride for 81-year-old Veronica Jesse
of San Jose.;    "It's like a little vacation for me," said the petite senior
citizen who leans slightly and walks with a cane.;    Jesse and the other
riders were greeted by the Rev. Martin Grizzel at the Civic Auditorium.;   
"Brother Martin is shining down on us right now, and he is applauding us from
another land right now," he said to the 5,000 people who packed the
auditorium. About 1,000 others stayed outside the auditorium.;    Most of
those at the celebration had taken part in an orderly march through city
streets, and many marchers carried signs calling for an end to war in the
Persian Gulf.;    Jesse was accompanied by 11-year-old Nicole King and her
mother, Pam Burrell. Both were part of a community group called PACE, designed
to aid the elderly, and had been assigned to help Jesse along the trip. "I
like taking care of people," said Nicole, as she sipped a lemon-lime soda.;   
Only the news that the teen had been shot during the celebration seemed to
dampen her enthusiasm as she shook her head slowly.;    "It's too bad. It's a
pity," said Burrell. She said they heard nothing of the commotion that took
place upstairs where the shooting had occurred.;    The turnout at San
Francisco's sixth annual official observance of King's birthday was one of the
largest in the country. In Oakland, more than 500 people took part in a march
and rally.;    The San Francisco march began in the predominantly black Bay
View-Hunters Point area, with about 2,000 participants. Marchers walked four
miles to the railroad station to meet the Freedom Train riders, then headed
six blocks on Market Street to the auditorium.;    Organizers said the San
Francisco march was primarily dedicated to King's life, but others broadened
the focus to include statements against the Persian Gulf war.;    In contrast
to last week's spirited anti-war demonstrations during which participants
occasionally clashed violently with police, the march proceeded peacefully
with about a dozen officers on motorcycles and four or five squad cars
escorting the crowd.  </TEXT>
