<LEADPARA>  An exhibit of historical photos and papers celebrating the accomplishments of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights movement will
make its debut in Gilroy starting Monday -- the day before what would have
been the slain civil rights leader's 62 birthday.;    Titled "Martin Luther
King Jr. and the Modern Black Freedom Struggle," the exhibit is a traveling
version of a similar permanent collection at Stanford University.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is on loan to Gavilan College from the university's Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project and marks the first time it will appear publicly outside
Stanford.;    Leah Halper, a writer and journalism professor at Gavilan,
arranged for the exhibit to celebrate both King's birthday and Black History
Month in February.;    "Too often Black History Month goes unmarked," she
said. "It's important to acknowledge the contributions to society that
different groups have made.";    Halper learned of the traveling exhibit
through Stewart Burns, Stanford's associate editor of the King project, and
wanted to make it the focus of what might be Gavilan's first formal
celebration of Black History Month.;    "It's very important that everything
that has been gained in civil rights has been fought for and we need to
remember the people that did that," she said.;    "I think it's well worth the
drive up to Gavilan. I hope the people from the greater Gilroy, Morgan Hill
and Hollister areas come to see it.";    Using photographs, magazine articles
from the 1960s and documents from the permanent collection of King papers, the
traveling exhibit "tries to tell the story of the black freedom movement and
King," Burns said.;    Since this is perhaps Gavilan's first formal exhibit
for Black History Month, he said, "It's fitting they would have a really high
quality exhibit.";    He also said that the exhibit's title accurately
reflects the experience of African-Americans and others during King's era.;   
"We use 'black freedom movement or black freedom struggle,' " he said,
"because 'civil rights movement' doesn't do justice to the depth and
significance of the movement. It really was a movement for freedom.";    Plans
call for the exhibit to be available to Bay Area public and private schools,
from elementary through college levels. Public schools will be given top
priority, Burns said.;    Meanwhile, the project's main task, producing
volumes of King's speeches, sermons, writings, correspondence and other
papers, continues at Stanford.;    Initial volumes, Burns said, are scheduled
for publication by the University of California Press in 1992.; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTEDThe exhibit will be shown through Feb. 15 in the Gavilan library and
may be viewed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday-Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Fridays. For more information, contact the college at (408) 847-1400.  </TEXT>
