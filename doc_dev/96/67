   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, whose
recent memoirs contained embarrassing assertions about the late
Martin Luther King Jr., stirred another furor at the dedication of
the Civil Rights Monument.
   At Sunday's dedication of the memorial to 40 people killed in
the civil rights movement, Abernathy walked unbidden to the front
to join hands with others in singing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   To many who are angry about his portrayal of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. as one with a weakness for women, the appearance at
the Southern Poverty Law Center was an intrusion.
   ``Along with 14,000 other persons, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy was
invited to attend the dedication of the Civil Rights Memorial,''
the law center said in a hastily prepared statement. ``He was not
asked to sit on the podium or make any comments.
   ``His ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into
the fold of the civil rights community after selling out its most
honored hero.''
   Last week, the Atlanta minister wrote to say he wouldn't attend,
officials of the law center said.
   After the ceremony, Abernathy shook hands and exchanged brief
remarks with Martin Luther King III, his first contact with the
King family since his book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,''
was published last month.
   ``He said he was hurt, and I'm sorry he's hurt,'' Abernathy
said. ``He expressed the sorrow and grief that I have done to his
family. I told him I've told nothing but the truth and didn't think
I was revealing anything new.''
   King, a county commissioner in Atlanta, left quickly after the
ceremony without speaking to reporters.
   Abernathy's book says King was with two women and fought with a
third the night before his assassination in Memphis, Tenn., on
April 4, 1968.
   Many black leaders say the book betrayed the man who made
Abernathy his second-in-command during the turbulent civil rights
era.
   Johnnie Carr, who heads the Montgomery Improvement Association
the elder King founded during the 1950s bus boycott, shook her
finger at Abernathy after the ceremony and was visibly upset about
his book.
   ``We'll talk later,'' she told him.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., one of those who criticized the book,
said he still considered Abernathy a friend.
   ``I have no malice, no ill feeling,'' Lewis said. ``An occasion
like this brings people together and helps them forget about
conflict.''
   Abernathy said he regrets nothing about the book.
   ``In the last speech he made, and I quote, Martin said, `Ralph
David Abernathy is my best friend in the world,''' he said. ``He
would have wanted me to reveal that he was a human being.''
