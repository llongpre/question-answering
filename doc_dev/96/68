   Education leaders have held the first national
conference on how to improve teaching about the life of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.
   Participants on Tuesday said many schools suffer from a lack of
teacher understanding about King's political and philosophical
record, as well as a shortage of course materials.
   ``You cannot simply go out and say `I'm going to teach about the
life of Dr. King' unless you know about his life, unless you
understand and have resources available,'' said Mary Futrell,
president of the National Education Association.
   Other speakers at the three-day conference conceded they did not
know enough about King and his campaign for non-violent social
change to instruct on the topic.
   ``One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about
King,'' said Gordon Ambach of the Council of Chief State School
Officers. ``That curriculum was certainly before my time.''
   Added Manya Ungar, president of the National Parents and
Teachers Association:
   ``You have to recognize that an association like mine is
predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, middle class and
suburban. The board members with which I deal with ... are not
reflective of the greater society _ particularly that portion of
society which increasingly has problems getting their voices heard
and their agenda addressed.''
   ``... Parents have got to educate themselves and find out who
Martin Luther King was,'' Ms. Unger said. She noted that her group
was in touch with other organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation
League, to help with producing literature by next June.
   ``We hope to have literature aimed at the parents _ talking
about how we either overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach
racism or perpetuate this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.
   The Washington conference was sponsored by the Education
Committee of the Federal Holiday Commission and the Martin Luther
King, Jr., Center for Non-Violent Social Change.
   Futrell said she hoped the conference would be ``the first of
many'' to focus on the question of how to better prepare courses on
King and his accomplishments.
