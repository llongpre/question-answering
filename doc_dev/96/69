   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, will be awarded the Martin Luther
King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize for 1990.
   Lowery has headed the SCLC, a civil-rights group founded by King
more than 30 years ago, since 1977.
   He will receive the $1,000 prize next month at Atlanta's
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached, during the 21st
annual Ecumenical service, officials with the Martin Luther King
Center for Nonviolent Social Change announced Thursday.
   The service will be held on Jan. 15, King's birthday. The
service concludes a nine-day observance of King's 61st birthday
anniversary.
   ``Dr. Lowery's life and work provide a shining affirmation of
our 1990 King Week theme, `Nonviolence: A Time to Act, A Way to
Live,'' King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said in a statement
Thursday.
   Others who have received the peace prize include President
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines in 1987, Rosa Parks in 1980,
former President Carter in 1979 and labor activist Cesar Chavez in
1974.
