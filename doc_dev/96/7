As Americans remembered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his 60th birthday 
anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, Coretta Scott 
King, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address Sunday, calling the civil 
rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
At Boston University's School of Theology, where King received a doctorate 
degree in 1955, students and teachers gathered for a Sunday night candlelight 
vigil. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush, returning to Washington on Sunday from a three-day 
Florida fishing vacation, scheduled an address to a prayer breakfast at a 
Washington hotel today -- a federal holiday recognized by every state except 
Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
King was killed by a sniper on April 4, 1968, while standing on a motel balcony 
in Memphis, Tenn. The assassin, James Earl Ray, was imprisoned for life. 
</P>
<P>
In Selma, Ala., three blacks will be sworn in as members of the Dallas County 
Commission today. It was there that King began the historic 1965 
Selma-to-Montgomery march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of Erskine Minor, Perry Varner and D. L. Pope will end 112 
years of white county rule and 10 years of legal battles to keep the commission 
white in a place where 55% of the residents are black. The three new 
commissioners were elected in special balloting last month. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. King, speaking at the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where 
King and his father shared the pulpit, said the ceremony was to honor "a 
courageous young dreamer who picked up the torch of freedom and carried it from 
Montgomery to Memphis with an unshakable faith in the promise of the American 
dream. Martin passed that torch to us to continue the pursuit of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Although the 'white only' signs of the 1950s and 1960s are gone," she 
said, "segregated neighborhoods and schools remain a pervasive fact of American 
life." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Play by Boston Students 
</P>
<P>
The city of Boston was hosting a ceremony and a tribute to King, including a 
performance today of a play written by students titled "Dreams." The play's 
title was taken from King's moving 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
An interfaith service was held in the nation's capital at the Washington Hebrew 
Congregation to commemorate King's birthday, and the civil rights leader was 
remembered in religious services throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, the Mormon Church said it is closing its offices today to 
allow church employees to observe the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Boston University was holding religious services to commemorate King's birthday 
and to mark today's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in a sermon Sunday at a church in New York's 
poverty-stricken Harlem section, lashed out at those who set back King's 
efforts by "self-destruction" through drugs and violence. "Dr. King was our 
gift from God. Martin Luther King did not fight and die for your right to use 
cocaine, crack and heroin," said Jackson, who marched for civil rights with 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will be in Atlanta today to deliver a sermon and help lead a parade. 
Tonight in Los Angeles, he will receive the SCLC Martin Luther King Award.
