   Boston University, declaring that it owns all of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers, has asked a court to order the
widow of the slain civil rights leader to surrender the documents
to the school.
   The university made the demand Wednesday in a counterclaim filed
in response to Coretta Scott King's suit seeking the return of
83,000 documents her husband gave the school four years before his
death.
   BU Trustee Melvin B. Miller, whose law firm is defending the
university in the suit, refused comment on the case, and Jim
O'Brien, one of Mrs. King's lawyers, said he had not reviewed the
university's counterclaim.
   The university argues that it not only owned the documents in
its possession, but also any other documents written by or
collected by King, who was assassinated 20 years ago this week.
   The university asked for a court order requiring Mrs. King to
surrender all her husband's papers, contending that she violated
King's pledge to BU and had ``wrongfully detained and converted the
remainder of Dr. King's papers.''
   BU also seeks damages, attorneys' fees and an inventory of any
King's papers that are in her possession or at the Martin Luther
King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta.
   In her suit, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Mrs. King requests
that BU be ordered to give the King papers it has to the Atlanta
center, which was established in 1968 and contains more than
100,000 documents belonging to King.
   The BU collection contains speeches, sermons, letters and
photographs from the 1950s and 1960s, including the outline for his
famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech delivered at a 1963 Washington,
D.C., rally.
   King, assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, wrote in a July
1964 letter that the collection would become BU property following
his death. Mrs. King, however, claims her husband privately
indicated he wanted his papers stored permanently in the South.
   Mrs. King also accused BU of damaging her husband's papers by
mishandling them. In its response to her suit, BU contended that
any damage to the papers was caused by King, Mrs. King or their
associates.
   Central to the case is a one-page, typewritten letter dated July
16, 1964, from King to the BU library.
   King, who received his doctorate in theology from BU in 1955,
wrote that the library would be ``the repository of my
correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.''
   ``In the event of my death, all such materials deposited with
the university shall become from that date the absolute property of
Boston University,'' King said in the letter.
   BU contends the letter made it legal owner of the documents when
King died.
   Mrs. King and her attorney contend the letter is not binding.
They also have noted that King never followed through on a pledge
in the letter to make annual gifts to the university from the
collection.
