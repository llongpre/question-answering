   Black and Jewish veterans of the civil rights
movement joined hands Tuesday and sang ``We Shall Overcome'' as they
remembered their coalition's martyrs and looked to its future.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, whose presidential library was
host to the two-day conference on black-Jewish relations, called
cooperation between the two groups in the civil rights movement ``an
extraordinary demonstration of common purpose.''
   ``I saw even while I was in the White House some beginnings of
fragmentation in that partnership, and I think your effort to bring
it back together and to derive the great benefits that can flow from
it is indeed a noble effort,'' Carter told conference participants
Tuesday.
   A memorial service honored Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and
Michael Schwerner, civil rights workers killed in Mississippi in
1964, as well as others who were slain, such as Martin Luther King
Jr. Chaney was black, while Goodman and Schwerner were Jewish.
   During the service, Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman of New
York, read a brief quotation from King, and Chaney's brother, Ben
Chaney of New York, read from the writings of a Jewish victim of the
Holocaust, Anne Frank.
   The service was prolonged as conference participants brought up
many more names of departed heroes, including many who were neither
black nor Jewish.
   The conference was designed to chronicle black-Jewish cooperation
of the past, but several speakers Tuesday emphasized the coalition's
recent strains and its hopes for reconciliation.
   Conference participant Wilbert Tatum of New York called the
difficulty in black-Jewish relations ``something terrible.''
   ``I think in retrospect it was based more on `not in my back
yard' than any other sentiment,'' Tatum said.
   He said he hoped the two-day conference, which concluded Tuesday
at the Carter Presidential Center, would be a catharsis.
   Among those warmly recalling old friendships Tuesday was Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young.
   ``There was no more important relationship in the civil rights
movement than the relationship of Martin Luther King and Stanley
Levison,'' Young said. He called Levison, an Atlanta attorney and
activist, an important voice of reason who emphasized non-violence.
   The conference, ``The Black-Jewish Alliance: Reunion and
Renewal,'' was sponsored by the Carter center, the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, the Washington-based
Marjorie J. Kovler Institute for Black-Jewish Relations and the
Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
