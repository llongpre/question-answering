   Wyoming became the 46th state to honor
Martin Luther King Jr.'s ideals when Gov. Mike Sullivan signed
legislation Thursday creating a state holiday dedicated to equal
rights.
   Although Wyoming calls itself the Equality State because it was
the first to give women the vote, it took years for lawmakers to
agree to set aside the third Monday in January in King's honor.
   Legislative leaders opposed to the holiday questioned whether
King should be singled out, noting that many other Americans also
fought for civil rights.
   The legislation Sullivan signed into law creates ``Martin Luther
King Jr. Wyoming Equality Day.''
   Championing the measure for the past eight years has been state
Sen. Liz Byrd, the Legislature's only black.
   ``It was a real disappointment each year to watch the failure of
the Martin Luther King Jr. legislation in the Wyoming
Legislature,'' she told the crowd jamming the Statehouse rotunda
for the signing ceremony. ``Those years of trying to get this
legislation passed were trying times. But today is a happy day.
Today is a historic day.
   ``What a wonderful centennial gift to be here today and to have
this bill,'' Byrd added, referring to Wyoming's 100th birthday this
July 10.
   The King holiday did not come easily. Senate opponents urged the
body to reject a holiday in King's name and support one simply
commemorating equal rights.
   The House also was uneasy with the holiday in King's name only
and added the Wyoming Equality Day provision to the legislation.
   The four states that do not recognize the King holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.
