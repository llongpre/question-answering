   Protests and a memorial marked the
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death Tuesday in the city
where an assassin's bullet felled the civil rights leader 21 year
ago.
   ``To commemorate any year of a life or death of our civil rights
leaders is an event because Dr. Martin Luther King represents so
much to so many people,'' said Ron Walter, vice president of the
NAACP's Memphis chapter.
   ``(The anniversary) is a symbol of hope, a symbol of struggle
and of unmet American commitment to equality in American society,''
he said.
   The day was a holiday for city sanitation workers, whose strike
King had come to Memphis to support. The civil rights leader was
shot by James Earl Ray while standing on a balcony of The Lorraine
motel.
   On Tuesday the Rev. Osagyefo Suhkara Abdul Yahweh led a midday
march from the motel to the Clayborn Temple Church, where a
memorial service was held.
   Later, a ``Poor People's Campaign Rally'' was held in front of
The Lorraine, and anyone with a complaint was allowed to speak for
up to two minutes.
   ``Some talk about human services, some talk about juvenile
court,'' said the leader of the rally, Muhammad A.R. Ziyad.
   Most, he said, complained about the conversion of the Lorraine
into an $8.8 million civil rights museum. Ziyad's group has filed a
lawsuit in Memphis over the plans to demolish the motel and erect
the museum in its place.
   The original plan ``was to convert it to a shrine to Dr. King
instead of bringing in memorabilia from the gay rights struggle,
the Boston Tea Party and all this other involvements that has
nothing to do with Dr. King,'' Ziyad said.
   Another memorial was attended by striking members of a municipal
workers union, who then set up a picket line in front of the
Memphis Housing Authority.
   Elsewhere, about 400 blacks marched through the streets of
Niagara Falls, N.Y., to protest the city's refusal to declare
King's birthday a holiday. City officials say it would cost some
$110,000 to give workers another paid day off.
   ``We can't help but feel that this is a form of racism,'' the
Rev. William T. Spencer said at a City Hall rally.
