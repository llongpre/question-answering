<LEADPARA>  Slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. will be remembered Sunday at
a commemorative service sponsored by the Afro-American Cultural and Historical
Society of the Tri-City Area.;    "This is a ceremony to honor Dr. King and
the civil rights movement and the rewards of the movement," said Jean Ficklin,
founder of the society. "We will reflect on all the things he did and what
came out of it -- like having the right to vote."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The program, which is scheduled for 3 p.m. at First Presbyterian Church in
Newark, will feature the Rev. Frank Jackson as keynote speaker and the Faith
Presbyterian Church choir from Oakland. Also featured will be harpist Joyce
Rosenfield, pianist Chave Alexander, soloist Maryetta Griffin, the St. Louis
Bertrand's Amazing Grace Choral Ensemble, and the Christian Jubilee Center
Choir from Santa Clara.;    In addition, the AACHS scholarship recipients will
be presented, along with the youth speech contest winner, Yancey Scoche
Richardson.;    This is the 10th year the society has sponsored a program to
honor the memory of King, whose birthday was Jan. 15. The theme, "Living the
Dream, Let Freedom Ring," follows the theme of national observances for King.;
   The local Afro-American society was founded in 1973. Ficklin began the
society when a multi-ethnic community group, created through the Commission
for Social Concerns in Newark, divided into specific ethnic groups.;    The
society promotes the African-American culture and heritage, and awards three
$150-$300 scholarships annually to local black high school seniors.  </TEXT>
