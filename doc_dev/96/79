   Wyoming's Legislature approved a bill
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with a
holiday after debating the issue for seven years.
   The Senate voted 21-9 to concur with House changes to the
proposal, calling the holiday Martin Luther King Jr.-Wyoming
Equality Day and celebrating it on the third Monday in January.
   If Gov. Mike Sullivan approves the legislation, Wyoming will
become the 46th state along with the federal government to observe
the holiday.
   Wyoming observed the federal holiday for the first time on Jan.
15, King's actual birthday. King's birthday became the 10th
national holiday in 1986, eight years after he was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn.
   The four states that do not recognize the federal holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.
   The Legislature dropped Columbus Day, celebrated on the second
Monday in October, from Wyoming's list of legal paid holidays. The
House had added the amendment to prevent the state from having to
pay more to state employees who got the day off.
