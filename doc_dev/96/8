   A daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a son of
Martin Luther King Jr. helped launch a campaign against capital
punishment on Friday, saying the death penalty will not bring their
slain fathers back to life.
   Society should put some killers in jail ``and leave them there
forever. But while we're at it, dismantle the electric chair, the
gas chamber. They won't bring back my father, they'll only take
someone else's father,'' said M. Kerry Kennedy of Boston, who was 8
when her father was killed in 1968.
   Other speakers during a meeting at the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change urged religious leaders to
become more active in mobilizing their congregations against the
death penalty.
   The campaign, called ``Lighting the Torch of Conscience,'' is
aimed at getting the religious community to confront the capital
punishment issue. It will culminate in June 1990 with a 330-mile
pilgrimage from Starke, Fla., where Florida's electric chair is
located, to Atlanta.
   Camille Bell, an Atlanta woman whose son Yusef, 9, was murdered
in 1979, also spoke against capital punishment. Yusef Bell was one
of more than 20 young black Atlantans whose deaths were attributed
by police to Wayne Williams, currently serving two life prison
terms for two of the killings.
   ``I know the pain I felt when Yusef died,'' Ms. Bell told the
gathering of about 100. ``No other mother should have to feel that
pain.''
   Martin Luther King III, a son of the slain civil rights leader,
said the execution of King assassin James Earl Ray ``would not
bring my father back.''
   ``If we believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
most of us would be without eyes and without teeth,'' he said.
   Friday's session opened with Delbert Tibbs, a former Florida
death row inmate, carrying a lighted torch from King's tomb into an
auditorium of the King center.
   Tibbs, convicted of murder and rape, spent two years on death
row before his conviction was overturned and he was freed in 1977.
   He urged people to ``listen to and be guided by that still,
small voice from within'' to work to solve crime problems without
the death penalty.
   Sister Helen Prejean of New Orleans, a death row spiritual
adviser and director of the Pilgrimage for Life program in her
hometown, said she had accompanied three men to the electric chair
and watched them die.
   ``They are the fire in me that is not going to go away until
things change,'' she said.
