   Led by impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, opponents of a
paid state holiday commemorating assassinated civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. filed petitions to let the voters decide the
issue.
   If 43,350 signatures submitted Monday are validated by spot
checks, the holiday's fate will be determined during the November
general election.
   Mecham and his supporters say an unpaid King holiday already
exists. They say the real issue is whether voters want to give
state employees another paid day off, not whether they want to
honor the slain civil rights activist.
   Mecham, one of five Republicans running for governor this year,
led a group that filed 71,000 signatures.
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, speaking for a coalition of business
and civic leaders, said the holiday is needed ``to honor the
remarkable progress America has made in race relations.''
   The cost of the holiday has been estimated at $500,000 to $4
million a year. But some civic leaders say they'd rather pay for
the holiday than suffer bad publicity over Arizona's lack of a paid
holiday.
   Mecham's successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, urged voters
to approve the paid holiday.
   The holiday has been a sore point in Arizona since 1986, when
Babbitt bypassed the Legislature and issued an executive
proclamation establishing a paid King holiday for executive-branch
employees.
   Republican Attorney General Bob Corbin issued an opinion saying
Babbitt's action was illegal. Mecham, who took office in 1987,
rescinded the paid holiday before it could take effect.
   He later established an unpaid ``Martin Luther King-Civil Rights
Day'' on the third Sunday in January. That proclamation has never
been repealed, but supporters of the paid King Day called it a
second-class honor and refused to recognize it.
   The Legislature decided last year to swap state workers' paid
Columbus Day holiday for a King Day, an action that already has
been made subject to approval on this November's ballot. The Mecham
drive would put a second referendum on the ballot to approve or
reject a 1990 law that restored Columbus Day in addition to King
Day.
   If voters approved both laws, the one with the most affirmative
votes would prevail. If they rejected both, the state would revert
to a paid day for Columbus and no paid day for King.
