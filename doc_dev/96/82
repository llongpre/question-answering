   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was named
Friday as the 1991 recipient of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Nonviolent Peace Prize.
   The award will be presented to Gorbachev on June 1 at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, said Coretta Scott King, chief executive
officer of The King Center and widow of the slain civil rights
leader for whom the prize is named.
   ``No world leader has done more than President Gorbachev to
de-escalate the arms race and pave the way for greater democracy
and economic freedom around the world,'' Mrs. King said.
   The annual award includes a medal bearing the likeness of King,
a citation and a $1,000 stipend.
   The '91 award is being presented early so that it can be given
to Gorbachev during his U.S. visit, said King Center spokesman
Steve Klein.
   The 1990 recipient was the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights group
founded by King.
