   James Meredith, whose enrollment as
the first black at the University of Mississippi sparked rioting in
1962, now is fighting white liberals instead of white supremacists.
   ``I was engaged in a war and the only thing that has changed is
the enemy,'' Meredith told reporters Sunday on the eve of the
national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr.
   ``When we went to Mississippi my enemy was the white
supremacists. My enemy now is the white liberal.''
   His enrollment at Ole Miss resulted in riots that were
suppressed by federal troops. But he since has called integration
``the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.''
   Meredith said he never considered himself a part of the
civil-rights movement.
   ``That's always been an insult to me,'' he said.
   Meredith blamed many of society's ills on a ``liberal elite,''
which he said wants to keep blacks in a second-class position under
the pretext of helping them.
   Meredith surprised civil-rights activists in September when he
went to work as an adviser to arch-conservative Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.,
   Since Helms' election to the Senate in 1972, he has vigorously
opposed civil-rights legislation and other domestic programs
favored by many blacks.
   Meredith, speaking to reporters before an address at Mount
Holyoke College, had little to say about King or Helms' opposition
to creating of the King holiday.
   ``The issue is not about Martin Luther King's birthday being a
national holiday,'' he said. ``The issue is about the Martin Luther
King holiday commission.''
   Helms has opposed funding for the federal commission Congress
set up to promote the holiday. He says establishing such a
commission for one individual sets a bad precedent.
