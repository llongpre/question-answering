   The teachings of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
should inspire people to tackle contemporary issues, two speakers
said in an ecumenical service Sunday kicking off a celebration of
the 60th anniversary of King's birth.
   ``His kind of love challenges us to take some risks we are not
taking. Dr. King's preaching will not leave us in peace,'' said the
Rev. Joseph L. Roberts, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. King
once was co-pastor at the church.
   The Rev. JoAnna Adams told of the day her church was burglarized,
with evidence left of drug use by the intruders who apparently sat
on the floor and read children's Bible stories before leaving the
building.
   ``It was a reminder to me that all is not well in this world,''
she said. The thief ``gave me a message I have to bring you:
`Without the message that Martin Luther King brought to this world,
the world will choke on violence and destruction,''' she told 700
people at the three-hour service.
   The service at The Temple launched a week of activities in
Atlanta leading up to Jan. 16 national holiday honoring the late
civil rights leader.
   Meanwhile, in an East German celebration of the 60th anniversary
of King's birth, the Rev. Joseph Lowery told a congregation that the
world's churches must help keep alive King's dream of world peace
and racial equality.
   Speaking to about 300 worshipers at the Church of St. Mary in
East Berlin, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference quoted poet Langston Hughes, who ``called upon us to hold
fast to dreams, for when dreams die, life is like a broken bird and
cannot fly.''
   ``We in the church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ must hold
fast to the dream. We have made much progress in my country toward
racial equality, but we still have a long way to go. In the struggle
for racial justice, we will hold fast,'' said Lowery, an Atlanta
minister.
   Lowery spoke in the same gothic-style sanctuary with 100-foot
ceilings and ornate columns where King preached in 1964.
