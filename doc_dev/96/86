   Martin Luther King 3rd, eldest son of the
slain civil-rights leader, said his father would have been
embarrassed by city officials' resistance to a court order to build
more integrated housing.
   ``It is really kind of contradictory that the city officials of
Yonkers would want to celebrate a Martin Luther King holiday and
not try to live out what Martin King was about,'' King said during
a breakfast speech Sunday, the day before the national holiday
celebrating what would have been his father's 61st birthday.
   ``If he were here, I think he would be embarrassed,'' said King,
who was 10 years old when his father was assassinated in 1968.
   ``Do you want to go down in history for doing what was expedient
and popular or for doing what was right?'' King asked the audience
of about 500 city officials and residents.
   The audience was mostly black, but it also included Yonkers'
newly-elected mayor, Henry Spallone.
   Spallone was one of four city council members who defied a
federal judge's ruling that found ``consistent and extreme''
housing segregation and ordered more integrated, low-income housing
built.
   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned contempt fines for
the council members but did not rule on the judge's discrimination
finding.
   Spallone campaigned for mayor on a pledge to continue the
resistance.
   In an interview after King's speech, Spallone rejected the
implication that Yonkers is a racist city. He said the city has
more low-income housing than any other municipality in Westchester
County.
   But he also said some compromise on housing might be found.
   ``What's great about America is that there is always dialogue
and always common ground to be reached,'' Spallone said.
