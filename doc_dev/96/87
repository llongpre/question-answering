   A state holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. won preliminary Senate approval by one vote, but
the future of the bill was uncertain.
   ``We'll have to see what the (Republican) caucus wants to do,''
Senate President Carl Kunasek said after Tuesday's vote.
   Kunasek, a Republican who blocked a similar measure earlier this
year, is not required to bring the bill to the floor for a final
vote.
   The bill cleared the calendar for debate on a 14-13 vote
Tuesday, but 16 votes are needed for final passage by the 30-member
Senate, and sponsors were unsure whether they could muster the
needed support.
   One of the three Republican senators absent Tuesday, John
Mawhinney, has said he would vote for a holiday for the slain civil
rights leader, while another, Jeff Hill, opposes it. Sen. Jacque
Steiner walked off the floor shortly before the measure came up,
and said later she had not made up her mind how to vote.
   The King measure has been controversial for years in Arizona,
which has separate February holidays for George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln. Many Republicans say they want to keep a separate
day for each president because Lincoln, a Republican, is important
to them.
   The federal government has combined the Washington and Lincoln
days into a single holiday and created a day for King on the third
Monday in January.
   The state Senate passed a King holiday like the federal day in
1986, but the House rejected the bill.
   In 1987, the House passed a King holiday only to see the Senate
bottle it up in committee.
   The governor at the time, Bruce Babbitt, then issued an
executive proclamation declaring a King holiday, but his Republican
successor, Evan Mecham, rescinded it, citing advice from Attorney
General Bob Corbin who said only lawmakers could create a paid
holiday for state employees.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 when the Senate convicted
him in an unrelated impeachment trial.
   House leaders said they would wait for the Senate to act first
this year, and a King bill cleared the Senate government committee
but was mired in the Rules Committee, which Kunasek controls.
   On Tuesday, three Republicans joined the Senate's 11 Democrats
in tacking the King day provisions onto a state pension bill that
had already hit the floor for debate.
   Kunasek said he believed the amendment might violate a provision
in the state constitution requiring that each bill deal only with
one subject. He said Senate attorneys would examine the question.
   During the debate on the measure, opponents said the question
should be referred to the voters.
   ``I have yet to see one poll where the people of Arizona want a
paid holiday for Martin Luther King,'' said Republican Sen. Peter
Kay.
   Supporters said the state was losing prestige and tourist
dollars because of international publicity about the controversy.
