   A renegade black Catholic priest on Sunday
declared Martin Luther King Jr. a saint but Vatican officials said
the slain civil rights leader was ineligible for canonization.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings told a congregation of nearly 900
people that to canonize King was to ``ratify what God had already
done.''
   ``Martin Luther King, Jr. is a saint by virtue of his life work,
his communion with God and his sharing in the joys of everlasting
life,'' said Stallings.
   In a lavish three-hour service Stallings said King was ``a
doctor and martyr'' and exhorted the worshippers to follow King's
example by dedicating their lives to a cause.
   Stallings is prohibited from giving communion and performing
other duties as a priest since breaking from the Catholic church in
July to form the Imani Temple African American Catholic
Congregation.
   Vatican officials in Rome said King would not be eligible for
sainthood even if the ceremony was performed by a sanctioned priest.
   ``Reverend King may have been a great man, but because he was
not a Catholic, that judgment must be left to others outside the
church,'' said a Vatican official.
   ``They say King wasn't a Catholic, but there are saints who
aren't Catholic,'' said Imani Temple spokesman William Marshall.
   Catholic Information Center researchers say Pope John Paul II
has named 250 saints and as many as 1,500 candidates are being
considered.
