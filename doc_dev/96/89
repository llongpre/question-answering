   The legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated 20
years ago Monday, was remembered around the country Sunday by
blacks and whites continuing the fight for racial equality and
social justice that King began.
   ``Twenty years later, everything has changed and nothing has
changed,'' Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership conference, a civil rights organization formed by King,
said Sunday night at a memorial service in Memphis, Tenn.
   America's poor are as bad off as ever, speakers told the 500
people attending the service at the Mason Temple where King gave
his ``Mountain Top'' speech on the eve of his murder at the
Lorraine Motel in Memphis.
   ``I've been to the mountain top ... I've looked over, and I've
seen the promise land,'' King said in the speech. ``I may not get
there with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we as a people
will get to the promised land.''
   Benjamin Hooks, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said the address was one of the most
emotional he had heard King deliver.
   ``It was a tremendous experience,'' Hooks said before speaking
to about 500 people attending the Memphis service.
   Hooks urged the audience to renew its commitment to King's
``poor people's campaign,'' which was under way at the time of his
death.
   ``So Dr. King, we haven't made it yet ... but we are determined
from this day, we are going to march forward, and ain't nobody
going to turn us around,'' he said.
   On Monday in Memphis, a memorial sponsored by the city is to
begin with a ceremony at the Lorraine, followed by the beginning of
a Southern Christian Leadership Conference march through Alabama,
Mississippi and Georgia. That march is to conclude April 30 in
Atlanta.
   A simple wreath-laying ceremony will be held Monday afternoon at
King's tomb in Atlanta at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, has long favored an approach
focusing on her late husband's life, not his death. Last year, she
came out in opposition to plans to make the Lorraine Motel a
museum, and said she did not want such a project to bear his name.
   Also in Atlanta, the SCLC planned to hold its ninth annual
``Drum Major For Justice'' awards dinner Monday night. The event
takes its title from a phrase King used to describe how he wished
to be remembered. This year's honorees include U.S. Rep. Michael
Espy of Mississippi, singer Dionne Warwick and Washington Redskins
quarterback Doug Williams.
   Sharissa Fox, 17 and a senior at Greensboro Dudley High School
in North Carolina, worries that her generation may not hear King's
story often and powerfully enough.
   ``Black people have made progress since King's assassination,
but I don't think we have gone as far as he would have liked,'' she
said. ``His message was to help other people as much as we can. But
my generation is so hooked on themselves, they don't have time.''
   In Portland, Ore., nearly 100 people on Saturday joined in a
1.5-mile walk to mark King's assassination on April 4, 1968.
   ``When people gather together there is hope,'' said Ron Herndon,
co-director of Portland's Black United Front. ``The message is
there still are those who will stand up against racism.''
