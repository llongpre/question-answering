   The youngest son of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. has resigned as president of the center that
carries his father's name amid talk of a rift among the leadership
over the center's direction.
   Dexter King's resignation was announced Thursday by the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, but no reason
was given.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said King stepped down because
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were
reports of a rift between King and his mother, Coretta Scott King.
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams said the center was
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which the elder
King founded.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. King,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' said Williams, a former
lieutenant of the elder King. ``When they started talking about
leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing,
and both got hurt.''
   Mayor Andrew Young, who was an aide to the elder King in the
'60s, was quoted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying the
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   A King Center official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Mrs. King might return to the presidency she relinquished to
her son.
   The King Center is a non-profit organization devoted to
education about King's teachings and philosophy. It also urges
action on international racial issues, especially apartheid in
South Africa, and is host to the annual Martin Luther King Jr.
birthday week celebration.
   The SCLC has taken an activist approach to the problems of
poverty and racism since it was founded in 1957 by King and the
Revs. Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement,'' Lowery has said.
``When you do that, you step on toes and you don't become the most
popular kid on the block.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a follower of King in the 1960s and a
former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said
in a telephone interview from Chicago that the two groups are
complementary rather than competitive.
   ``The fact that Dr. King remains a frame of reference for
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized,''
Jackson said, referring to the center.
   ``The SCLC's legacy (is) direct action, challenging the racism,
challenging anti-semitism,'' he added.
   Dexter King, 28, was elected in January to take over from his
mother, who remained as chief executive officer. He said he wanted
to cut the center's dependency on donations and put it on a solid
financial base so it could ``market and disseminate'' non-violent
teachings.
   King could not be reached at the office of his business,
Visionary Development Corp.
   In a statement from the King Center, board Chairman Jesse Hill
Jr. did not address the reasons for King's decision.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill wrote.
   The King Center, on Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue, contains a
museum and Martin Luther King Jr.'s tomb.
