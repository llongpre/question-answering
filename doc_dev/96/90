<HEAD>After Remarks Cause Stir, MLK III Says He Opposes Discrimination</HEAD>

   Martin Luther King III, whose remarks to a school
group about homosexuality angered gay-rights groups, said Wednesday
he opposes discrimination against anyone.
   King, a Fulton County commissioner and son of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., said in a speech Tuesday that he
thinks homosexuals have a problem.
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way,'' he told middle-school students in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Any man that has a desire to be with another
man has a problem, in my opinion. And that applies to any woman who
has a desire to be with another woman.''
   The New York-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
called King's remarks ``strange and upsetting,'' and on Wednesday
the Atlanta Gay Center requested a meeting with King to discuss the
remarks.
   In a statement issued by his office Wednesday, King said he
understands the obstacles that discrimination poses for all
minorities.
   ``I can state without any reservation that I am totally
committed to protecting the rights of members of the gay
community,'' King said.
   ``Further, I must emphasize strongly and emphatically that I
oppose any form of discrimination against gays and that I will
continue to seek non-violent ways of protecting all men, women and
children from any and all forms of discrimination.''
