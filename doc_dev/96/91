   When Arizona lawmakers ended years of bitter
debate in September by creating a state holiday to honor the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., it seemed the issue finally had been put to
rest.
   But four months later, as 46 other states and the federal
government prepare to honor the slain civil rights leader on
Monday, Arizona's holiday is on hold and the state faces more
months of divisive debate before voters settle the controversy in
November.
   Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a holiday by executive
order in 1986, but it was rescinded by his successor, Republican
Evan Mecham, after the state attorney general ruled that Babbitt's
order was illegal.
   Year after year, the Republican-controlled Legislature refused
to enact the holiday but offered to put it before the voters.
Supporters rejected that option, saying privately that they feared
it would be rejected and that the campaign would divide the state
and cause further harm to its image.
   Democrat Rose Mofford, who became governor when Mecham was
removed by impeachment convictions, finally found the key to
getting a King holiday bill through the Legislature during a
September special session.
   She got business leaders to spur lawmakers into action by
arguing that not having a King holiday was hurting the state's
economy and could kill its chances of landing the 1993 Super Bowl.
   Dozens of conventions and meetings had been canceled in 1987 and
1988 in a boycott to protest Mecham's cancellation of the holiday.
The state estimated the lost convention and tourism receipts at
more than $25 million.
   The Legislature agreed to the holiday, but only if it supplanted
Columbus Day so that state employees would not be given an
additional paid day off.
   That set the stage for two groups _ those who didn't think King
deserved a holiday and the Italian-Americans who wanted Columbus
Day preserved _ to launch a petition drive to put the issue on the
November ballot.
   They collected nearly 80,000 petition signatures, nearly twice
the number required, in only three months.
   The King holiday was put on hold in December pending the outcome
of the referendum effort. Among other things, that means Arizona
still will observe Columbus Day in 1990.
   Julian Sanders, a conservative activist who spearheaded the
petition drive, said he was convinced that a majority of Arizonans
don't want a King holiday.
   ``The people in Arizona are really angry about what's
transpired,'' he said. ``It will still go down 2 to 1.''
   Supporters of the holiday have begun organizing for what many
believe will be a bitter campaign, and say they fear the rejection
of the King holiday here could strengthen opposition to the holiday
elsewhere.
   ``Should Arizona rescind the King holiday, this will simply be
the first state to put that issue on the ballot,'' said Sen.
Carolyn Walker, the only black in the state Senate. ``Then it will
go like dominos.''
   Noting that pressure from the business community was a key in
passing the King holiday bill in September, supporters hoped for
continued support from that sector.
   ``For me, it's the wrong motivation,'' said Dr. Paul Eppinger,
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Phoenix and a leading
proponent of the King holiday. ``But if that's the motivation that
stimulates people, I'll take it.''
   Business leaders pledged support Friday at a Martin Luther King
breakfast in Phoenix.
   ``The business community is very eager to get the holiday
passed, whatever the cost is to the Legislature,'' said Bill
Shover, director of public affairs for Phoenix Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette.
   Shover, who also is chairman of the Phoenix '93 Committee that's
bidding to bring the 1993 Super Bowl to Phoenix, said business
leaders fear a renewed economic boycott of the state.
   Sanders argues the state has not suffered economically because
of the King controversy; and even if it had, that is not the issue.
   ``If we don't have a majority in this state that wants to honor
Martin Luther King for what he was as a man, then the whole thing
is a fraud and a sham,'' Sanders said.
   State lawmakers say it is unlikely any legislative action will
be taken on the issue before November.
   ``This is an election year,'' said state Rep. Sandra Kennedy, a
supporter of the King holiday. ``No one wants to say anything about
the King holiday. They're all saying, `Let's let it go to a vote of
the people.'''
