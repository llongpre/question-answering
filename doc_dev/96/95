   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who shared 17
jail cells with Martin Luther King Jr., marched with him in Selma,
cradled his bloody head in Memphis and broke with his followers
over a tell-all memoir, is dead at 64.
   Abernathy died Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital while being
prepared for a lung scan to locate a suspected blood clot, hospital
spokeswoman Tisha Burland said. The cause of death was not
immediately known.
   As King's chief lieutenant, Abernathy was at his side at almost
every key battle of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s
and took his place as leader of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference after King's 1968 assassination. But the fame and
adulation enjoyed by King never quite extended to Abernathy.
   In a 1986 interview, he lamented that during a visit to a school
in Connecticut, ``not a single student knew who I was.''
   In 1989 he was reviled as a traitor to the cause for writing
about King's alleged marital infidelity in his autobiography, ``And
The Walls Came Tumbling Down.'' Abernathy wrote that King spent
time with two women and had a violent argument with one in the 24
hours before his assassination.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, was among those who praised
Abernathy on Tuesday. She issued a statement from Zimbabwe, where
she was attending celebrations of that country's 10th anniversary
of independence.
   ``When our home was bombed and our lives were threatened, he was
there,'' she said. ``His strength as a tactician and a counselor to
Martin during our struggle has been eloquently recorded in Martin's
own writings and in the annals of the American civil rights
movement.''
   King's son, Fulton County Commissioner Martin Luther King III,
called Abernathy's death ``a very tragic loss to our nation.''
   President Bush hailed Abernathy as ``a great leader in the
struggle for civil rights for all Americans and a tireless
campaigner for justice.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who succeeded Abernathy as president of
the SCLC, described Abernathy on Tuesday as ``a faithful servant of
the cause of liberty and justice.''
   Abernathy had been in the hospital since March 23 for treatment
of a sodium deficiency and had suffered strokes in 1983 and 1986.
At the time of his death he was pastor of West Hunter Street
Baptist Church.
   Born in Linden, Ala., the son of a farmer, Abernathy joined with
King in 1955 to lead the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott that lifted
King to national fame. For the next 13 years King and Abernathy
were virtually inseparable.
   ``We were known as the civil rights twins,'' Abernathy once
recalled. ``We always sought to complement each other. I never
tried to be a copy of him and he never tried to be a copy of me.''
   They co-founded the SCLC in 1957, and Abernathy was in a nearby
cell when King wrote his famous ``Letter from the Birmingham Jail''
in 1963, setting forth the goals of their movement.
   Later that year, Abernathy was at King's side for the ``I Have a
Dream'' speech that climaxed the march on Washington, the biggest
demonstration in U.S. history. He was in Sweden when King received
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and the two led the
Selma-to-Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965.
   And on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., Abernathy took King's
bloody head in his hands moments after an assassin's bullet cut him
down.
   But in his autobiography, Abernathy said he felt other King
aides saw him as ``no more than an appendage to Martin ... who
never played an important role.''
   King had directed that Abernathy succeed him at the SCLC despite
Abernathy's reluctance. Abernathy led the 1968 Poor People's
Campaign that brought thousands to Washington. But the SCLC lost
its leadership role in the civil rights movement as key aides such
as Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson left to follow their own paths.
   Abernathy stepped down from the SCLC leadership in 1977 and
slipped back into King's shadow while other black leaders stepped
to the fore. In 1986 he was excluded from a planning group for the
first Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday.
   After publication of his autobiography, Abernathy was criticized
in a statement signed by 28 prominent blacks, including Young,
Jackson, Lowery and Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. His
alma mater, Alabama State University, rescinded its decision to
name a dormitory after Abernathy.
   His friend Hosea Williams branded Abernathy a ``Judas.''
   On Tuesday, Williams called him ``one of the truest human rights
leaders America has ever produced.''
   ``By giving unselfish leadership and through suffering and
sacrificing, Dr. Abernathy has earned the second most important
place in history,'' Williams said.
   Abernathy's survivor's include his wife, Juanita; two sons,
Kwame and state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy III; and two daughters,
Juandalynn and Donzaleigh.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
