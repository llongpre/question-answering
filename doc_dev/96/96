   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy was carried to his
crypt Monday on a wave of praise, riding in a plain mule-drawn
wooden wagon flanked by his sons and colleagues in the civil rights
movement.
   The procession followed a service at which civil rights leaders
who criticized Abernathy for his controversial account of Martin
Luther King Jr. got a public rebuke.
   The famous and the humble piled shoulder-to-shoulder inside a
southwest Atlanta church for the four-hour service for the man who
was King's longtime chief lieutenant in the civil rights movement.
   Afterward, two mules, pulling a green wooden wagon bearing
Abernathy's casket, set out from West Hunter Street Baptist Church,
where Abernathy was pastor, for Lincoln Cemetery.
   King's body was carried to its resting place by a mule-drawn
wagon after he was assassinated in 1968 at the suggestion of
Abernathy, who considered it symbolic of humility. Relatives said
Abernathy wanted the same for himself.
   Abernathy's bier traveled in a two-hour procession of 22
limousines that passed dilapidated buildings and drug-nfested
communities along the street named in honor of King.
   Groups of people, some with children and pets, lined sidewalks
as the wagon inched along in a sea of 150 suited marchers,
including Abernathy's sons, Kwame and state Rep. Ralph David
Abernathy III, and movement associates Andrew Young and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   Among those speaking at the funeral was Georgia state Rep.
Tyrone Brooks, who said said the civil rights movement should be
proud instead of embarrassed by Abernathy's book, ``The Walls Came
Tumbling Down.'' The autobiography, published last year, touched on
King's alleged extramarital affairs.
   Brooks, who was a student activist in the 1960s, stood in the
pulpit above Abernathy's rose-covered coffin and waved a copy of
the book. He urged the crowd of 2,500 to read it.
   ``It was not a mistake,'' Brooks said. ``It is the truth. All
636 pages.''
   Among those present were King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and
three of her children; King's sister, Christine King Farris;
Benjamin Hooks, head of the NAACP; U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.;
Robert Kennedy Jr.; Archbishop Eugene Marino; and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Abernathy, who was King's closest friend and adviser, died April
17 of a heart attack induced by a blood clot. He was 64.
   Jackson said Abernathy's accomplishments through the civil
rights movement far outshadow any disagreement brought by his
memoirs.
   ``One cannot judge a player by one exceptional play,'' Jackson
said. ``Nor can a player be judged by an error. Ralph Abernathy is
in the hall of fame. We must pay homage and thanks.''
   Hugh Gloster, president emeritus of Morehouse College, King's
alma mater, described Abernathy as ``second only to Martin Luther
King as a leader in the civil rights movement.''
   ``You have had your share of abuse and scorn,'' Gloster said.
   Abernathy's son, Ralph David Abernathy III, compared his father
to the biblical hero David, saying he slew ``the Goliath of
racism'' and served as a stellar role model.
   ``I am the son of a giant slayer,'' he said.
