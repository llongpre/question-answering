<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday officially
proclaimed Jan. 16 as Martin Luther King Jr. day, saying the slain
civil rights leader's ``work is not done, but neither is his witness
stilled.''
   ``We must reaffirm in every generation the lessons of justice and
charity that Dr. King taught with his unflinching determination, his
complete confidence in the redeeming power of love and his utter
willingess to suffer, to sacrifice and to serve,'' the president
said.
   The day is a federal holiday and also is a holiday in some states.
