   A generation after Medgar Evers and
Martin Luther King Jr. were killed, the nation's first memorial to
martyrs of the civil rights movement was dedicated Sunday as
relatives expressed hope that young people will carry on the spirit
of that turbulent era.
   Several people cried as they touched the cool water that flows
across a circular black granite slab engraved with important events
of the era, including the names of 40 people who died in the
struggle for racial equality.
   The memorial is of the same material and by the same architect
as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
   ``I hope this will vitalize the struggle, keep it fresh in the
minds ... for the youth,'' said Ollie Gordon, a Chicago
schoolteacher whose cousin, 14-year-old Emmett Till, was shot to
death in 1955 by whites angered that he had spoken to a white woman.
   ``I talk about Martin Luther King and ask why we celebrate his
birthday, and many children don't know,'' Ms. Gordon said.
   More than 400 law enforcement officers provided security for the
dedication ceremony, which was held without incident. A Ku Klux
Klansman from Georgia tried to get a police permit to lead a
demonstration, but he was blocked by the city and a federal judge.
   Speakers at the ceremony included Rosa Parks, whose refusal to
give up her seat to a white man sparked the Montgomery bus boycott
of 1955-56, and relatives of those honored on the monument,
including Martin Luther King III.
   ``The struggle is not over yet,'' the son of the civil rights
leader told a crowd estimated by police at between 5,000 and 6,000.
``Something is wrong in a nation that doesn't set its priorities to
take care of all its people.''
   Relatives viewed the monument before the dedication which ended
with thousands joining hands to sing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``It's a very moving experience,'' said Myrlie Evers of Los
Angeles, whose husband, Medgar, was the highest-ranking NAACP
officer in Mississippi when he was assassinated in 1963. ``It says
to me that there's hope.''
   Julian Bond, the first black state lawmaker in Georgia, said it
was important to remember others besides King and Evers who died in
the struggle.
   ``Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a
Martin Luther King movement,'' he said. ``Many were ordinary,
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a
difference.''
   The $700,000 monument also honors James Chaney, Andrew Goodman
and Michael Schwerner, who were shot to death during the 1964
Freedom Summer and whose slayings inspired the recent movie
``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``Poetry in granite'' was how Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman
of New York City, described the memorial designed by Maya Lin.
   ``Nobody who sees it cannot feel that it's a moving, moving
piece of art,'' Ms. Goodman said. ``It brings that period so
vividly alive that you can almost relive it.''
   The monument is in front of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a
few blocks from the Alabama Capitol, where Jefferson Davis took the
oath of office as president of the Confederacy in 1861, and near
the Baptist church where King launched the Montgomery bus boycott
in 1955.
   The 9-foot-high granite wall is inscribed with words from the
Bible that King chose for his first speech during the bus boycott:
``Until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a
mighty stream.''
   King, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said he thought his
father's words were ``very appropriate.''
   He said the memorial focuses attention on inequalities that
still exist and will serve as a hands-on history lesson for young
people.
   ``Perhaps they can get an understanding of why people lost their
lives,'' King said.
   Also at the ceremony was his father's top lieutenant, the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy, who has been scorned by many black leaders
because of his recent book, which portrays the elder King as having
a weakness for women.
   The two shook hands and spoke briefly after the ceremony.
   ``He expressed the fact that he was hurt,'' said Abernathy. ``I
told him that I love him and he'll understand someday, hopefully.''
   Abernathy joined hands with others on the podium at the end of
the ceremony to sing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Afterward, the law center criticized Abernathy's actions, saying
he was not asked to sit on the podium or make any remarks. ``His
ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into the fold
of the civil rights movement after selling out its most honored
hero,'' the statement said.
   The law center published a 104-page magazine that tells the
story of each person named on the monument, and copies were sent to
schools around the country.
   Mamie Till Mobley of Chicago, Emmett Till's mother, said she
hoped the memorial would be an ``awakening'' for youngsters too
young to remember when whites and blacks were forced to drink from
separate water fountains.
   ``It shows you that you don't have to be great, just be the best
you can be,'' she said. ``It doesn't take shakers and movers to
make changes. Everybody can do it.''
