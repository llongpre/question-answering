<HEAD>Minister Supports Charge That Abernathy Lied About King</HEAD>

   A minister has backed up claims that the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy lied when he wrote that the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. had two encounters with women the night before he
was killed.
   Abernathy's autobiography, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,''
suggests that King had extramarital affairs and contends he was
with two women and physically fought with a third the night before
his April 4, 1968, assassination in Memphis, Tenn. The book has
been widely criticized by others in the civil rights movement.
   At a news conference in Washington Tuesday, the Rev. Bernard Lee
said Abernathy had passed out drunk on the night in question.
   Lee's statement supports a charge made earlier by Adjua Abi
Naantaanbuu, a Memphis woman who said she was with King and
Abernathy the night before King was killed. Ms. Naantaanbuu, who
appeared with Lee at the news conference, said Abernathy asked her
to prepare dinner for King's group at her home and Abernathy had
several drinks.
   ``Following dinner, Rev. Abernathy, who had had too much to
drink, asked (Ms. Naantaanbuu) if he could lie down on her bed,''
Lee said. ``She directed him to her bedroom, where he remained
asleep until about 3 a.m.''
   Ms. Naantaanbuu said the only time she was alone with King was
when they were trying to awaken Abernathy. She said she drove King,
Abernathy and Lee back to the Lorraine Motel, where King was
assassinated hours later.
   The news conference was called by the Coalition of Friends and
Beneficiaries of the Martin Luther King Jr. Dream. The group
includes many who were prominent in the civil rights movement of
the 1960s.
   The news conference was led by Benjamin L. Hooks, national
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
