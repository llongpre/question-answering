<LEADPARA>  THERE seem to be two schools of thought, neither of which is very large, about
this new photo at the top of my column. Some people tell me they love it.
Others say it makes me look old, because I must be bald if I'm wearing a hat.
Well, I still have my hair, but I am old.;    Meanwhile, there have been
letters on other, more interesting topics:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mr. Lee Quarnstrom, I resent your ignorant view you have of Santa Cruz
County . . .;    Dennis Campi; Los Gatos;    Thanks for sharing, Dennis.; We
appreciate the fact that you included our store in your feature article on
shopping in our part of the Santa Cruz Mall. We have no doubts that your
intentions were good, and that you thought that by describing Anubis Warpus as
a "punk" store, you were helping our business . . . We are writing to you
because we feel that you misrepresented the true character of our store . . .
The store has much more to offer, and "punks" constitute a negligible portion
of our clientele . . . Your article has stirred some negative emotions toward
us, since the word "punk" tends to have negative associations, especially
among people who are older and more conservative than ourselves and people who
shop at Anubis.;    Anubis Warpus; Jacek Lentz and Brian Friedman,; owners;
Santa Cruz;  You note in your letter that you sell Dr. Martens shoes, those
favored by punks. I guess I could say, if the shoe fits, wear it. But, since
I'm basically a nice guy, let me merely say that your inventory, which
includes black leather clothing, material on tattooing, lava lamps, etc.,
looks dandy, and I'm sure you're correct when you say that your customers
include grandmothers, students and "young people in general with a taste
somewhat out of the ordinary." Let me also say that what you consider
"somewhat out of the ordinary" seems to this "older and more conservative"
Santa Cruzan to be rather banal. Anyway, best of luck. Meanwhile, let's try to
call it "the Avenue" instead of the Mall.; YOUR column indicates that you have
accepted the Warren Commission's canard that Lee Harvey Oswald murdered John
Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository . . .;   
Iain Prentice; Sunnyvale;    If you'd have been a newspaper reporter for as
long as I have, you, too, might have serious doubts not only about the ability
of the CIA, FBI or U.S. military, whom you say you suspect, to pull off such a
conspiracy, but also to keep everyone involved from blabbing during the past
27-plus years. Also, frankly, more than a quarter-century later, I don't
really care anymore who killed JFK. The man is dead, and a lot of good-headed,
good-hearted political concepts died with him.; THE statement that
"Watsonville is on the brink of disaster" is totally inaccurate and
reprehensible. This city has made great strides in recovery . . . from the
earthquake and agricultural setbacks.;    Anne Lucero; Watsonville;    There
has been a lot of construction on Main Street compared to what's been going on
in Santa Cruz. But I still believe that Green Giant's pullout to Mexico,
coupled with the need for much more rebuilding, present some grave problems
for your town -- where, by the way, I worked for nine years and still visit
frequently.; Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for making my day. No, my
month . . . with your article about bees. I have not laughed so hard for so
long . . . You are truly funny.;    Janice Marklein; San Jose;  I'm passing
your kind remarks along to my editor.; Are you still writing a column? Here is
a self-addressed, stamped envelope.;    Dad;    It's in the mail.  </TEXT>
