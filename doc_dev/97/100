<LEADPARA>  SARATOGA'S Villa Montalvo has announced another generous 47-concert summer
series, most of it held in the outdoor Garden Theater behind the historic
villa.;    The mix of dance and pop, classical, jazz, blues and Cajun music
opens April 13 with Pocket Opera performing Offenbach's operetta "La vie
Parisienne" in the Carriage House, and it winds down Sept. 20 with a
performance by storyteller Brenda Wong Aoki.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The programs are split about 50-50 between Bay Area and touring
attractions, according to a spokesman. He emphasized that the number of annual
performances is now frozen, out of consideration for neighbors in the
residential area where Montalvo is located.;    Montalvo is a 175-acre estate
with gardens, built in 1912 by Senator James Phelan.;    Some concert
highlights include:;    (box) The fusion band Spyro Gyra June 21.;    (box)
The Duke Ellington Orchestra June 28, followed two days later by the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band.;    (box) Jazz keyboardist David Benoit July
12-13.;    (box) Two front-lawn concerts by George Cleve and his Midsummer
Mozart Festival Orchestra, which traditionally draw the summer's biggest
crowds. They'll be performing all-Mozart concerts, July 14 and 28.;    (box)
The American Indian Dance Theatre July 21.;    (box) Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
presenting black music from South Africa, Aug. 4.;    (box) Singer Diane
Schuur, a two-time Grammy winner, Aug. 16.;    In serious music, opera takes
top billing, with three companies involved. Pocket Opera gives four intimate
Saturday-night programs indoors, ending June 1. They feature "Don Pasquale,"
"The Secret Marriage" and "The Barber of Seville." The Merola Opera,
inevitably a sellout, will present Verdi's "La Traviata" with orchestra (and
one performance will feature tenor Stephen Guggenheim) Aug. 9-11 in the
1,000-seat Garden Theater (outdoors).;    Recitalists of interest include
clarinetist Richard Stoltzman on June 7, and the cello-piano duo of Carter
Brey and Christopher O'Riley on Sept. 1. In addition, Chamber Music West
features the Fidelio Quartet on June 9.;    Other events include a springtime
series of emerging-artist concerts ending June 9, with performers such as
Barbara Higbie, Kitka, Dvoika, R. Carlos Nakai, Neil Rutman, the Billy Childs
Group and Opera San Jose resident artists Susan Gundunas and Dan Montez.;   
In addition, there are programs by guitarist Michael Hedges on May 26,
monologuist Spalding Gray on June 14, Ottmar Liebert on June 16 and the
Rippingtons on June 22.;    June 23 brings a pairing of the Five Blind Boys
from Alabama with the Persuasions. Beausoleil comes July 5, with Vocal Motion
and Bobby McFerrin's Voicestra two days later.;    Jazz pianist Marcus Roberts
plays July 19; the Great Tap Reunion, July 27; and Jon Hendricks, Aug. 2.;   
The Lamplighters perform Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta "The Pirates of
Penzance" Aug. 18, and Shakespeare Santa Cruz does "Midsummer Night's Dream"
Aug. 24-25.;    Branford Marsalis is featured Aug. 30 and the Oakland Ballet's
"Peter and the Wolf," Aug. 31.;    Sept. 6 spotlights David Grisman with Mark
O'Connor; Sept. 7, Poncho Sanchez; Sept. 8, the San Jose Symphony's
"Superpops"; and Sept. 14, the Chinese Magic Revue.;    Free brochures on the
series are available by calling (408) 741-3428. For "La Traviata" only, call
(415) 565-6492.  </TEXT>
