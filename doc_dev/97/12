<LEADPARA>  WE KNOW The Question. It is deceptively simple. And it has dogged us ever
since that first time we got to stay up late and watch from the top of the
stairs as Mom and Dad donned silly hats, blew cardboard horns and indulged in
other mysteriously un-grown-up behavior. Every year, without fail -- somewhere
between the first flying champagne cork of New Year's Eve and the last fizzing
Alka Seltzer of the Tournament of Roses Hangover -- we ask ourselves: "Why do
we do this?";   We do it because after all these years music, dancing,
champagne and people we love are still four of the very best things in life.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HAPPY GROOVE YEAR

<MEMO>  FRONT LINES  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     We do it because hunkering down in front of the tube while others make
merry seems like a slothful, downright cowardly  way to greet a new year full
of possibilities.;   We do it because we want -- and deserve -- to be
unshackled from yesterday's business. Shredding the calendar. Cleaning the
slate. End-ing the inning. Initiating a karma download. Closure, by whatever
name, is a comfort and a joy.;   Goodbye, Gorby. So long, Bill Graham. Happy
trails, Johnny Carson. That's a wrap, Willie Smith. Don't slam the door on
your way out, Kevin Mitchell. Thanks for stoppingby, Anita Hill. John Sununu
and Saddam Hussein -- your 15 minutes are up. Please clear the set and make
way for presidential primaries, Olympic heroes and post-Soviet Asia.;   Around
