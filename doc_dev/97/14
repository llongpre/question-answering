<TEXT>   SANTA CLARA COUNTY;    Midsummer Mozart Festival, July 10-Aug. 4, a movable
feast. Conductor George Cleve migrates with his all-Mozart orchestral programs
through Cupertino's Flint Center, San Francisco and Berkeley, plus some Villa
Montalvo dates. Soloists Ivan Moravec, Andre Watts, Daniel Kobialka, and
Melvyn Tan. (408) 864-8816, (415) 762-2277.;    Festival of the Arts, Foothill
College, Los Altos Hills, through Aug. 18. A little of everything by area
companies, from "Carousel" to "The Merry Widow" to a rare staging of Verdi's
opera "Jerusalem" and a Mozart "Requiem" sing-along too. Prices in the $2-$20
range. (415) 948-4444.;  SANTA CRUZ AREA;    Cabrillo Music Festival, July
25-Aug. 4. Composer-conductor John ("Nixon in China") Adams leads this year's
event as the migrating fest on the coast pulls into Santa Cruz's newly
renovated 970-seat Civic Auditorium. The highly laid-back, informal orchestral
festival is the West Coast's most adventurous one in 20th-century music.
Soloists: Stephanie Chase, Richard Goode, JoAnn Falletta and Dora Ohrenstein.
There's the usual excursion to Mission San Juan Bautista. (408) 429-3444.;   
Carmel Bach Festival, July 15-Aug. 4. This is the most sentimental journey of
the summer, with Conductor Sandor Salgo, heading the rituals for 36 years,
stepping down this August. A heavy dose of Mozart this year, including "The
Magic Flute." (408) 624-2046.;  SAN FRANCISCO;    Mozart &amp; His Time, a
citywide festival through June 30. The vast program of more than 50 events and
150 performances includes concerts, opera, lectures, views of mental health,
zany quasi-Mozartian inventions. (408) 998-2277.;    Chamber Music West, June
3-15. The S.F. Conservatory of Music hosts near-nightly changing concerts, to
include the Tokyo String Quartet, Stuart Canin, Hai-Ye Ni, David Krehbiel.
There are digressions to Saratoga and Berkeley. (408) 741-3428, (415)
665-0874.;    Stern Grove Festival, June 16-Aug. 18. This outdoor park stage
has the greatest weather extremes, but it's all free, every Sunday at 2 p.m.,
unreserved seating and picnic space. Highlights: Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
Afro-Cuban bands, S.F. Ballet, S.F. Symphony, opera, Gilbert and Sullivan,
Smetana's "The Bartered Bride." For season brochure, send an addressed,
stamped envelope to the fest at 44 Page St., Suite 604D, San Francisco 94102.;
   Pocket Opera, PG&amp;E Beale St. Theater, Sundays through June 23. The
funniest, most intimate opera company dreamed up by Donald Pippin roars back
with "The Secret Marriage," "The Barber of Seville," "The Marriage of Figaro"
and a modern-day adaptation of "The Abduction from the Seraglio." (415)
989-1855.;  FARTHER AFIELD;    Hollywood Bowl Summer Festival, July 3-Sept.
21. This summer ritual with amplification and 15,000 folks a night is famous.
The L.A. Philharmonic holds forth, with everyone from Simon Rattle to Henry
Mancini, Itzhak Perlman to Miles Davis. New this year is the conductor that
the San Jose Symphony almost snagged, John Mauceri, as director of the new
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. (213) 850-2000.;    Bear Valley Festival, July
27-Aug. 11. The 7,000-foot altitude adds to the exhilaration as Carter Nice
leads his seventh season. Orchestral concerts with pianist Ursula Oppens, plus
the opera "Carmen" with Hilda Harris. (209) 753-2574.;  WESTERN STATES;   
Oregon Bach Festival, Eugene, Ore., June 23-July 7. The northerly Bach fest is
as eclectic as Carmel's, but with the German orientation of conductor-scholar
Helmut Rilling at the helm. The 22nd season features mezzo Frederica von
Stade, pianist Jeffrey Kahane, and the three trumpeter brothers Laubin from
Germany. Also the Latvian chorus Ave Sol, the N.Y. Baroque Dance Co., and the
Angeles Quartet, in this spectrum of Bach, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Dvorak (the
latter via the opera "Dimitrij," in concert version). (503) 346-5666.;   
Seattle Opera Summer (Wagner) Festival, Seattle, Wash., Aug. 3-24, 1990. After
years of hiatus, Seattle gamely cranked up again its mighty Wagner "Ring"
tetralogy, more than 16 hours of myth and man -- and super-women, too --
sprawling over four days, with casts not on a plane with what San Franciscans
are used to. But San Francisco has discontinued its every-five-years "Ring"
sequence, thus Seattle's "Ring" wins the Western states by default. Using the
1986 Robert Israel production, it features stage director Francois Rochaix,
conductor Hermann Michael. (206) 443-4711.;    Santa Fe (N.M.) Chamber Music
Festival, July 7-Aug. 19. This year the multitude of programs highlight
Shostakovich and his Russian brethren. Chamber music galore, yes -- but with
the spice of Mozart's first opera, "Bastien and Bastienne" (July 11, 13).
