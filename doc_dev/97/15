<TEXT>  WHEN/WHERE: One-hour family performance, 7 tonight; regular performance, 8
p.m. Saturday. Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. Also, 8 p.m.
Tuesday, Performing Arts Theater, UC-Santa Cruz.; HOW MUCH: $5 (children 12
and under), $7.50 (adults) at family performance; $20 for Saturday show. (415)
903-6000. In Santa Cruz, $12, $10 students/seniors. (408) 459-2159.; WHY:
After mastering the traditional songs of Plains and woodland tribes, R. Carlos
Nakai began developing an individual style, using the American Indian flute in
a jazz ensemble, composing music for the Martha Graham Dance Company and
recording for Canyon Records.; THE GENUINE DIAMELLES; WHEN/WHERE: 10 p.m.
Saturday, Hotel Utah, San Francisco.; HOW MUCH: $3; (415) 421-8308; WHY:
Superlative a cappella pop that runs the gamut from "The Peer Gynt Suite" and
Boy Scout camp songs to Led Zeppelin and the theme to "Sesame Street."; 'THE
GIN GAME'; Deaf West Theater Company.; WHEN/WHERE: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday-Friday,
California School for the Deaf, 39350 Gallaudet Drive, Fremont.; HOW MUCH:
$4-$12; (510) 895-2430.; WHY: This is a contrived two-character play -- but
not when the dialogue is translated into American Sign Language by the great
Phyllis Frelich, who won a Tony for "Children of a Lesser God."; SAN JOSE
SYMPHONY; Under guest conductor Gabriel Chmura.; WHEN/WHERE: 8:30
tonight-Saturday, Center for the Performing Arts, Almaden Boulevard and Park
Avenue, San Jose; also 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Flint Center, De Anza College,
Cupertino.; HOW MUCH: $9-$37; (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.; WHY: Born in
Poland and an Israeli citizen, Chmura is an exciting international talent. He
is joined by Franklin Larey in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A Major.; SAN
FRANCISCO OPERA; WHEN/WHERE: "Elektra" opens Saturday, "Attila" opens
Thursday. Opera House, Van Ness Avenue and Grove Street, San Francisco.
Through Dec. 8.; HOW MUCH: $28-$85; (415) 431-5400.; WHY: Richard Strauss'
violently obsessive "Elektra" (sung in German) features the Wagnerian soprano
from Wales, Gwyneth Jones, in the title role. Starring as Attila in Verdi's
early gem of the same name (sung in Italian) is the swashbuckling bass Samuel
Ramey, who also has recorded the work with distinction. Supertitle projections
make it all linguistically painless.; 'SIGHTINGS'; Oakland Ballet.;
WHEN/WHERE: 8 tonight-Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, Paramount Theater, 2025
Broadway, Oakland.; HOW MUCH: $5-$28. (510) 465-6400.; WHY: In her first
ballet, Margaret Jenkins, whose contemporary choreography is a mix of the
cerebral and the sensual, discovers angels all around us. The Kronos Quartet
plays, live, a new score by Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe.; RETURN OF
THE YOUNG GALLERY; WHEN/WHERE: Reception, 5-8 tonight, 307 No. Santa Cruz
Ave., Los Gatos.; HOW MUCH: Free; (408) 399-1900.; WHY: A South Bay perennial,
the 20-year-old Young Gallery never really disappeared. But because it jumped
from one location to another -- through no fault of its own; blame
redevelopment and an earthquake -- it was sometimes hard to track. Now it's
back in business, purveying art with a contemporary beat. The opening show,
"Young-Again," includes gallery steadies John Battenberg, Fletcher Benton,
Gary Bukovnik, Beth Van Hoesen, Theodore Waddell and Reid Winfrey.  </TEXT>
