<LEADPARA>  A COUPLE months back, there was a story about a brick that clung precariously
to the wreckage of the Trust Building in Santa Cruz for 710 days after the
Loma Prieta quake. By the time it finally surrendered to the law of gravity,
it had come to symbolize the city's hang-tough attitude after the quake. It
was, as E.B. White would have put it, some brick.;   I was thinking about that
brick last Friday night as Iron John and I drove through the pounding rain
down to Marsugi's. Like the brick, the scrappy little San Jose rock joint is
hanging tough against all odds. And like the brick, its impending fall has
been falsely rumored for months.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At 10:30, even with the rain, the corner of South First and San Salvador
was alive with knots of freshly minted San Jose State students,
post-collegiate club kids and the apres-cinema crowd from up the block at
Camera One. "They never had any of this when I went to San Jose State," said
Iron John, taking it all in. "If you wanted rock 'n' roll, you went to the
Spartan Pub or you got nuthin' . . .";   Back in the bad old days before
redevelopment, "human cesspool" would not have been too strong a term to
describe the night scene at First and San Salvador. The local color consisted
of junkies, pimps, hookers, johns and winos. Today, two of the old porn
palaces are rock clubs -- F/X and the Cactus Club -- anchoring the southeast
and southwest corners. To the northeast, halfway up the block, there's the
artsy new Ajax Lounge. And holding down the last corner, Marsugi's -- the
weakest sibling in the rock 'n' roll family.;   It's conceivable that some
bionic bon vivant could rock around the block in one night -- hard rock at the
Cactus, hip-hop and house at F/X, hard-bop jazz at Ajax and home-brewed rock
at Marsugi's. But Iron John and I were feeling the weight of our years and we
decided to take it easy. So we hit only three.;   Life was tough back in '85
when Ed Sugitan leased the notorious Three-Star bar, told the nymphs du pave
to hit the road and rechristened the club Marsugi's. And it's still tough --
now that three competitors are breathing down his neck. But Sugitan said he
plans to stay at least a year longer.;   His plain-as-dirt operation could
make Oliver Twist's workhouse seem like Club Med. The interior of the
77-year-old red-brick building is little more than a shoe box. There are some
dead-dog ugly amateur paintings (the real art is the graffiti in the
restrooms), a few dusty beer signs -- and not much else.;   On the little
stage, hard by the front windows, the Delinquent Johns, a fast-and-tight
alternative-rock quartet, were going through the motions in front of about 40
college-age customers.;   Marsugi's is home to the remnants of the loose-knit
tribe of alternative-rockers who used to haunt the Laundry Works and Muzzie's.
Those clubs are long gone and the local scene that once burned bright is now
hopelessly fragmented. But all the old suspects -- the rockabilly cats, skate
punks, bikers and college-radio types -- still turn up at Marsugi's on a
regular basis. The club has the highest black-T-shirt-and-black-leather
quotient of any club downtown. My kind of folks.;   It's been five years this
week since I started writing about this tribe. And after a thousand long
nights looking for that elusive flash of rock 'n' roll glory, many of them are
nearing the end of the chase. Friday night, in between the hugs and the gossip
and the glad-handing, talk turned to marriages and houses and kids.;   The
Frontier Wives, the oldest of the old guard, went on at 11:30. When they
slammed into the opening chords of "Elvis Was A Spy," eight people began to
dance loosely around the front of the little stage. And when they rolled
through the goofy rave-up "Louie Pasteur," there were 20 people bouncing
around. Beers were spilled. Chairs were knocked over. Good times rolled. At
the end, it sounded as if 100 ragged voices were singing the chorus to "Ace
Frehley.";   "I get the feeling these people had heard it all before," John
said.;   "Yeah," I replied. "It's a tribal thing."; Marsugi's; 399 S. First
St., San Jose; Admission: $3-$5; Details: Live music, 9 p.m.
