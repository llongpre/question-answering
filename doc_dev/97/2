<LEADPARA>  WHILE MANY of their compatriots up the street have yet to return to buildings
that have yet to be rebuilt, the merchants of one stretch at the south end of
Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz seem to be flourishing.;    The men and women
whose businesses sit in the block between Maple and Laurel streets are
exhibiting a vigor and vitality that should be an inspiration to the rest of
us in Surf City, particularly the sorry nitpickers who are passing the time
fretting about how many feet apart the trees should be when the avenue is
rebuilt.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     People like Ken Stocks, whose Retrospect Records fills the space where
Lott's auto stereo shop sat for decades, have made that one-block stretch of
Pacific a delightful place to hang around. Not only do these business folks
operate some interesting and unique shops, but they also have banded together
to keep their block free of the bums whose besotted presences lurk in some
other parts of town like a bad smell that won't go away.;    Let's take a look
at some of the businesses along the southerly end of Pacific Avenue:;   
STOCKS' SHOP features old and rare recordings as well as old posters from the
days of psychedelic rock 'n' roll at the Fillmore, the Avalon and Winterland
up in San Francisco. Anybody my age -- except Republicans -- will have
something approaching a flashback when they see the old posters touting
appearances by Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Quicksilver Messenger
Service, Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, the Siegel-Schwall Blues Band,
the Charlatans, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, James Cotton, Moby Grape and
even the Peanut Butter Conspiracy.;    Nearby are places like Zachary's, which
serves the best breakfast in Santa Cruz, bar none; Tampico Kitchen, which puts
a tasty New Mexico black-bean spin on some of its entrees; Haber's, the
classiest furniture store in the county; and Cognito, where I look for
Hawaiian shirts whenever I have a couple of bucks to waste.;    New on the
block is Anubis Warpus, which seems to be a supply depot for punks -- a place
where punks can buy the outfits they need in order to hang out up the street,
near the Metro transit center. (You might think that punk, like disco, is long
dead. Not in Santa Cruz!);    There are other shops as well -- like Santa Cruz
Glass Co. and PIP instant printing, Joe's Barber Shop, like Cotton Tales, for
kids' stuff, Beat City Records, for music mostly by bands I can't stand, the
Free Exchange, a used-clothing emporium, Gateways, a New Age, spiritual book
outlet -- and they're worth a visit.;    ONE NICE thing about this south end
of Pacific Avenue is that the merchants have taken steps to make their
neighborhood attractive by getting the bums out. They've agreed to call the
cops every time they see any illegal activity -- such as panhandling -- and
they're very happy with the response of the Santa Cruz Police Department.
They've written judges asking that winos and crooks who used to frequent the
area be ordered to stay away from Pacific Avenue.;    The result is a
surprisingly bum-free business district, at least for that one end of the main
street.;    "It is hard to keep it hip and artsy and keep out the bad element
at the same time," admits Ken Stocks. "But we're doing it.";    The area
between Laurel and, say, the Catalyst has become the bohemian (or hip or chic
or cool or whatever you want to call it) district in a town noted for being a
lot less-than-traditional.;    "Look out there," Stocks, 44, said the other
day, waving his arm at the street outside the shop he's operated for a year.
"It looks like a healthy old town out there.;    "Business is getting better
and better. The stores here are interesting, really interesting.;    "Get the
word out. Let the people know. Tell 'em to come on down."  </TEXT>
