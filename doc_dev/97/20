<LEADPARA>  LIKE Count Dracula, the Broadway-Brommer connection keeps rising from the
grave, despite assurances from the powers that be that it's dead. Like Richard
Nixon or a week-old fish, this stinker keeps returning to the public plate as
Santa Cruz city officials hold their noses with one hand while seemingly using
the other to give a finger to the residents of the town's east side.;    It
should be noted right off the bat that I have a personal as well as an
altruistic stake in this: My home abuts Broadway and I hate the idea of the
already busy street being turned into a thoroughfare by double-talking Santa
Cruz politicians.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Over the years, I have, with very few exceptions, voted for the progressive
candidates for city council. We don't agree on everything, but we agree on
most things.;    I've been particularly impressed with the progressives'
promises when election time rolls around that as far as they are concerned,
Broadway-Brommer is dead, will remain dead and need never again even reach the
talking stage.;    Broadway-Brommer, for those of you who live where most of
the city council members live, on the west side of town, is a proposal that
would benefit 41st Avenue businesses -- and really hurt shopkeepers on the
east side and in downtown Santa Cruz. It would do so by putting some sort of
concrete strip across the meadows at the upper end of the yacht harbor to join
Brommer Street, in Live Oak, with Broadway, on the east side.;    The result,
of course, would be to make it easier for Santa Cruz shoppers to speed out to
41st Avenue to spend money in Capitola and raise sales-tax revenue for that
rich little burg instead of patronizing merchants in quake-devastated downtown
Santa Cruz.;    Despite progressives' promises that Broadway-Brommer would
never again rear its ugly head, it's back. This time, it's one of several
grotesque concepts touted as part of the proposed "arterial streets master
plan" -- the work of the city traffic engineer, a bureaucrat in the public
works department.;    NEVER ones to obey the old adage, "If it's not broken,
don't fix it," these engineers seem driven -- pardon the pun -- to come up
with insane traffic flow schemes. In this draft report, he suggests the need
for any or all of the following:;    Broadway-Brommer; a second Murray Street
bridge over the yacht harbor; a Soquel Avenue widened, at points, to six
lanes; and elimination of parking along parts of Soquel Avenue, an area where
businesses are always in trouble already because there's nowhere for customers
to park.;    Also put back on the table is the controversial eastern access
route through the Pogonip property to the UC-Santa Cruz campus.;    Yes, yes,
this is only a draft proposal, as far as I can determine. However, it seems
that the draft has been prepared by bureaucrats who work, ultimately, for the
very same city council that has a majority that has promised us that
Broadway-Brommer is dead.;    Come on, give those of us who live and/or do
business on the east side a break.;    It's long been clear that most of the
city council's thoughts seem to revolve around the west side neighborhoods
where most of them live.;    Although I've long thought that district
elections for the city council would be wasteful and unnecessary, the very
fact that bureaucrats don't know about, don't care about or don't believe in a
city council policy against Broadway-Brommer makes me wonder: Might we get
better representation on the east side if we were to have our own two or three
neighbors speaking for us down at City Hall?;    IF THE politicians don't mind
their underlings trying once again to revive Broadway-Brommer, and if they
can't understand that the businesses on the east side need parking, not a
speedway in front of their shops, maybe we need some changes.;    However, I
am sanguine that once again, the council will reassure us not to worry, that
Broadway-Brommer is dead.;    If not, it's time to drive a stake through its
heart.  </TEXT>
