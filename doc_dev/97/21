<LEADPARA>  Caught between earthquake recovery and a flagging economy, the downtown Los
Gatos retail district, once a chic area that drew shoppers from far and wide,
is struggling to regain its health.;    Granted, many of the scars of the 1989
Loma Prieta quake have disappeared and shoppers are returning to the
once-devastated area, but business is still painfully slow.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Retail is just off. It's a national trend, not just a local problem," said
Sue LaForge of the Los Gatos Chamber of Commerce. "But we've got the double
whammy of that and the quake. A lot of business owners have just finished
rebuilding, now the recession.";    While some businesses are failing or
barely staying alive, others surprisingly are doing well. It's difficult to
explain, said LaForge, and many factors are involved, including shop location,
how long they've been in business and what they're selling.;    Longtime
anchor stores, such as Chrislow's Department Store, Domus housewares, Crown
Books and the Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Company, all say business has been
strong. And a number of established restaurants, the retail area's bread and
butter, also report business has been good.;    But for others, many in
business for five or more years, like Melange clothing boutique, Folk Arts of
Los Gatos, Hathaway Collections, Elisabetta Fashions and Kids Too clothing
shop, the combination quake-recession pushed them over the edge.;    James
Aguiar, owner of Hathaway Collections, a jewelry and art boutique on North
Santa Cruz Avenue, is closing because he couldn't attract enough customers. He
mostly blames his location -- at the lonely southern end of the shopping strip
-- for failing to bring even kids walking dogs to his door.;    Aguiar said
high rent and the fact that he opened the shop right after the 1989 quake when
shoppers were staying away from downtown also contributed to the collapse of
his business.;    "I think we were in the right town, but not in the right
location or at the right time. It's been a real disappointment," said Aguiar,
who last week finally saw a steady stream of customers come through the door
to take advantage of his price-slashing close-out sale.;    Despite hard times
brought by the quake, many landlords are still demanding high rents for retail
space, which, coupled with paltry cash register receipts, is killing some
businesses that otherwise could have hung on. Los Gatos has always been known
for its high rents, but merchants hardly fussed about paying them until the
quake changed the downtown retail scene.;    Some merchants have asked for
rent breaks, but many of the landlords say they, too, are struggling with
hefty payments on earthquake reconstruction loans and can't help them.;    But
one property owner, James Farwell, is trying to be flexible, and in at least
one case so far has offered new tenants six months' free rent to help them get
on their feet in the new location.;    Farwell, whose La Canada building has
been undergoing quake repairs for the past 12 months, says it makes good
business sense to help shop owners establish themselves so the downtown can
become more stable and attract the returning customer. The block-long retail
building houses the popular Mountain Charley's saloon and has space for 20
stores.;    Businesses in the small downtown, especially new ones with a
product never before tried in Los Gatos, have had a high failure rate over the
last five years. In fact, many downtown retail areas throughout the valley
have suffered ever since the summer 1986 opening of the revamped Valley Fair,
which pulled customers away from old-style mom and pop stores to the flashy,
upscale mall with plenty of parking out front.;    Jennifer Borgardt, owner of
J. Alexander clothing store, knows that all too well. For five years prior to
the remodeling and expansion of Valley Fair, her business prospered in the Old
Town Shopping Center in downtown Los Gatos. Then, suddenly it started to take
a dive. Problems with the Old Town landlord forced her to move to another
location, which further hurt her business.;    Today, after another move to
North Santa Cruz Avenue and Main Street, Borgardt and new partner Diane
Richardson say they feel things can only get better. So far, their location
has been a great draw for foot traffic. And their idea to combine their two
businesses into one -- Borgardt's designer clothes and Richardson's line of
cosmetics -- has been well-received by customers.;    In fact, they say other
struggling business owners are teaming up to do the same, to save their
businesses and to enhance what they're selling.;    But innovative marketing
plans alone won't bring the scores of new customers the downtown needs to turn
it around. The area is in dire need of more parking, which has been a sore
point for merchants for a number of years. They're tired of hearing customers
say they don't like coming downtown because of the lack of parking and because
police aggressively ticket cars parked on busy streets.;    "If there was ever
anybody running a campaign to keep customers from shopping in Los Gatos, it's
the police department, " said Paul Dorsa, owner of the Opera House furniture
store on East Main Street. "I've actually paid tickets for customers so I
wouldn't lose them. We don't need it.";    The town, through a property
owners' assessment district, has rebuilt and repaved a number of downtown
parking lots. But construction of the largest lot -- a 308-space, two-level
facility -- has ground to a halt because toxic contamination was found beneath
it. The latest report from town officials is that the lot likely won't be
completed in time for Christmas.;    But merchants like Borgardt say that
won't keep them down. "Come spring, there will be a turnaround. We are going
to hang in there. If we didn't believe it, we'd be outta here and running
parachute rides at the Santa Cruz boardwalk."  </TEXT>
