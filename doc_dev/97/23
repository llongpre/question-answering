SANTA FE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is business as usual in Santa Fe. Unusual business. 
</P>
<P>
As one drives the highway toward the most popular mirage in the local desert, 
the familiar road sign still offers helpful advice: "OPERA TRAFFIC KEEP LEFT." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the open proscenium of the opera house that masquerades as an adobe, the 
lights of Los Alamos twinkle innocently in the distance. They provide a 
naturally magical cyclorama for the unnatural acts on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, visible from every seat in this semi-alfresco 
theater, serenely haunt the horizon. The lowest stars in the universe -- when 
left undisturbed by clouds or rain -- serve as an otherworldly yet emphatically 
dramatic ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
One would cheerfully come back, and back, to a setting like this even if it 
meant enduring yet another automatic-pilot "Carmen" or one more 
"Boheme"-by-the-numbers. But Santa Fe doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
John Crosby's idealistic company concentrates, much of the time, on unhackneyed 
repertory. Employing essentially youthful casts and imaginative directors, 
Santa Fe tries to take opera, the most irrational of art forms, seriously as 
musical drama. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe may not always succeed. At least it tries. 
</P>
<P>
It is trying this summer with five new productions. Only two of them -- Richard 
Strauss' "Rosenkavalier" and Verdi's "Traviata" -- can be classified as 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the unconventional, the current agenda includes the first 
professional staging in America of a long-forgotten example of perfumed Gallic 
trivia, Massenet's "Cherubin" (1905), not to mention an ambitious exhumation of 
an ultra-Baroque extravaganza, Cavalli's "La Calisto" (1651). Even more 
newsworthy, however, is the U.S. premiere of Judith Weir's "A Night at the 
Chinese Opera."(1987). 
</P>
<P>
A new-wave-chic entry from Britain, it was commissioned by the BBC and much 
praised when first performed by the Kent Opera in Cheltenham. Serving as her 
own librettist, Weir has concocted a fascinatingly complex musico-theatrical 
package that wants desperately to seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1954, raised in Scotland, trained mostly in London (briefly, in the 
States), influenced, to a degree, by the likes of Stravinsky, Britten and 
Messiaen, she has dropped an imposing calling card with this, her first 
full-scale grown-up opera. Los Angeles, incidentally, made her acquaintance in 
March, 1988, when the Monday Evening Concerts mustered the American premiere of 
"The Consolations of Scholarship," a 25-minute scena for soprano and nine 
players predicated on 13th-Century Yuan dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"A Night at the Chinese Opera," seen here Wednesday, shares a similar 
inspiration. Weir has, for some time, been preoccupied with the stark rituals 
of Asian narrative, although she filters the ancient impulses through 
distinctly modern sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In this opus, she introduces herself as a virtuoso juggler. In an hour and 40 
minutes (the timing excludes two mood-shattering intermissions), she manages to 
juxtapose farce and tragedy, realism and stylization, symbolism and fantasy, 
vaudeville and political satire, always with creative strokes that are 
extraordinarily bold, economical, swift and deft. 
</P>
<P>
The outer acts focus, with mock-Brechtian objectivity, on the plight of Chao 
Lin, an innocent canal builder oppressed by Mongolian rule in the era of Marco 
Polo. The central act, a startling opera within the opera, concentrates on the 
parodistic parallel of an actual Yuan play, "The Orphan of the Chao Family." 
</P>
<P>
Weir tells her multilayered tale in bleak Western tones cleverly ornamented 
with colorful imitation-Eastern accents. She speaks a fragile, concise, 
inventive musical language enhanced by subtle dynamic effects reliant on 
primitive harmonic constructions. 
</P>
<P>
The vocal lines, craftily stressed and supported by a percussive 
chamber-orchestra, span formal speech, expressive parlando, expanded 
declamation, agitated recitative and, occasionally, poignant lyricism. The 
composer even interpolates a caricature Italian-tenor aria for Marco Polo, who 
makes an irreverently amusing cameo appearance in the third act. 
</P>
<P>
For all its gutsy, extrovert trappings, the opera remains a fragile, 
introspective creation that seems to demand an intimate hall and a sensitive 
directorial touch. Unfortunately, Santa Fe couldn't provide the former and 
didn't provide the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The crafty words and muted emotional climaxes tended to get blurred in the wide 
open spaces. The dramatic affect tended to get blunted in the heavy-handed, 
gag-oriented staging of Robert Carsen (remembered for his ersatz-Sellars 
"Marriage of Figaro" this season in Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Ever resourceful when it comes to trendy cliches, Carsen interpolated tai-chi 
exercises for the cast before the music began, sent his protagonists into the 
auditorium in quest of false immediacy, and eventually blinded the audience 
with flashing searchlights, all for no apparent reason. Not content with such 
extra-operatic distractions, he reduced the Yuan play to a plodding burlesque 
that even dishonored the Marx Brothers allusion of the title. 
</P>
<P>
He did elicit neatly focused performances, however, from such hard-working, 
versatile singing actors as John David de Haan, Drew Minter, John Kuether, 
Philip Zawisza, Judith Christin, Kathryn Gamberoni, Douglas Perry, James 
Busterud, Joyce Castle and Anthony Laciura. Michael Levine designed witty, 
minimalist-cartoon decors, brashly lit by Craig Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next time. . . .
