<TEXT>     The Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts is bringing the
Asian-American acting company, Pan Asian Repertory, to its spanking new
facility March 14 through 16.;    The company is presenting Wakako Yamauchi's
play, "And the Soul Shall Dance," set in the Imperial Valley of California at
the end of the Depression. A 1977 production of the play in Los Angeles won
three LA Drama Critics Awards. The play has been revived and had a successful
run most recently in New York.;    "And the Soul Shall Dance," called an Asian
"Grapes of Wrath" by some critics, has apparently become more daring in its
new production, including more sensual material. That's according to director
Kati Kuroda, who seems to know the magic words in attracting an audience.;   
Meanwhile, TheatreWorks in Palo Alto readies a new production of the classic,
"Rashomon," at the Lucie Stern Theater, to run March 16 through April 6, after
previews March 14 and 15.;    The play, written by Fay and Michael Kanin from
the ancient stories by Akutagawa, will have an all-Asian cast locally. There
was a Broadway production in 1959 and an Akira Kurosawa film after that.;   
In Palo Alto the play will be directed by Yuriko Doi, who is artistic director
of San Francisco's Theatre of Yugen.;    Add to this an upcoming San Jose
Civic Light Opera production of Stephen Sondheim's "Pacific Overtures," May 16
to June 11. The show, with a mostly Asian cast, deals with American Commodore
Perry's "opening" of Japan to international trade.;    Finally, the hit
British musical "Miss Saigon" is readying previews on Broadway, with an
opening set for April 11. "Pacific Overtures" and "Miss Saigon" are Broadway
shows with Asian themes and not Asian shows themselves. However, as interest
in the themes grows, along with the Asian population, it's a good bet we will
be getting more Asian-oriented productions in our theaters, and soon.;   
Burgeoning Flint;  Cupertino's Flint Center seems poised to get a lot more
theater on its stage. Vicki O'Brien, who manages the Flint schedule, is in
discussions with the James Nederlander theater people in New York concerning
the possibility of bringing the hit musical "Grand Hotel" to Flint. The show
was supposed to play San Francisco, but a rift between the Carole Hays
Shorenstein office and Nederlander has scratched that run. So it may play
Flint for a week in August. The only holdup is cost.;    Also possible for
Flint Center is a new production of "Annie" with Gretchen Wyler and John
Schuck, the first week in June, and yet another production of "My Fair Lady"
with Neil Harrison or Richard Chamberlain.;    O'Brien says that recent
productions of "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera" (non-Broadway version) and
"A Chorus Line" have all done extremely well in Cupertino, leading to thoughts
of expanding the theater schedule.;    The Theater Beat;  Santa Cruz needs
more theater, especially during the bulk of the year when Shakespeare Santa
Cruz is hibernating. The Santa Cruz Actors Theater is trying to fill the
vacuum, with two original one-act comedies, "Yesterday's Paper" and "Citizen
Klein," on tap March 15 through April 14 at 1001 Center St. . . . Philip
Slater, a local playwright, is the author . . . Rick Reynolds, a local comic,
is very hot stuff in the stand-up trade. His "Only the Truth Is Funny,"
opening a new run at the Theater on the Square in San Francisco March 5
through 31, goes to Broadway this spring. Quite a leap . . .  </TEXT>
