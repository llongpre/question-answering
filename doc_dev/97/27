<LEADPARA>  For 76 years, first as a silent movie house with a Wurlitzer organ, then as a
theater for the early talkies, and more recently as an art film cinema, the
Los Gatos theater has provided a steady diet of local entertainment for young
and old, sophisticated and square, clean-cut and punk.;    From the 1922
silent "Robin Hood," starring Douglas Fairbanks, to "Oklahoma!" and cult
favorite "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the little 600-seat theater on the
town's main drag has screened it all through the years.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  L.G. THEATER'S ENCORE
HISTORIC MOVIE HOUSE SHATTERED BY QUAKE GETS
READY FOR COMEBACK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For a time, it was a favorite gathering spot for teen-agers on Saturday
night. Then the punkers and foreign film buffs packed the house. More
recently, yuppies brought their kids to see family-oriented movies like "Gone
with the Wind" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off.";    The old-fashioned
neighborhood movie house with its 1950s marquee has been dark for the last 21
months since the Loma Prieta earthquake pulled its lath and plaster facade
away from its frame and cracked its walls. The curious who stroll down North
Santa Cruz Avenue often stop and press their faces against the large glass
doors, straining to see some sign of repairs. They want the little theater to
open again.;    With luck and a lot of hard work by construction crews, that
could happen this fall. Within the last few weeks, carpenters, plasterers,
plumbers and electricians have begun tearing out bathrooms, walls, ceilings
and the theater's little glass ticket booth to rebuild them.;    They plan to
restore the cinema to its look just before the quake, only the structure will
be substantially stronger after crews finish pumping super-strength epoxy into
the walls and ceiling, making it less likely to shift in another quake.;   
Special care will be given to restoring the 1930s art deco goddesses and
towering pillars that stand floor-to-ceiling on both sides of the theater,
trademark touches in many old neighborhood movie houses. The deep red velvet
seats for the most part have held up well and will not need massive
re-upholstering, said contractor Chuck Taddo of Bay Area Construction, which
has taken on the repair job.;    Fond memories;    Taddo said the $160,000 job
is definitely a challenge, but one he finds fascinating because the theater
has such a rich history. He remembers going to matinees there as a kid, and
the job has brought back nostalgic memories of munching on M&amp;Ms and popcorn
from the old-fashioned popcorn machine -- still in the lobby -- and watching
movies like "Shane.";    Owner Carmel Cormack, 53, one of Los Gatos' more
colorful downtown characters, bought the building in 1974 after it had been
severely damaged by fire. Paying a rock-bottom price of $40,000 for it, she
brought in a crew of friends and relatives and fixed it up.;    Slept
upstairs;    It reopened in 1976, and Cormack even had small residential
quarters built on the theater's second floor where she could sleep overlooking
the classic neon marquee that faced North Santa Cruz Avenue.;    Today, the
property is estimated to be worth between $500,000 and $1 million.;    But
Cormack apparently did not have quake insurance on the theater, and has
struggled to obtain federal quake relief funds for reconstruction. Taddo said
she recently received a Small Business Administration loan enabling her to
start repairs. Cormack failed to show up at appointments with the Mercury News
to discuss the project and the future of the theater.;    But Los Gatos
officials who have worked with her on obtaining building permits said she is
enthusiastic about the cinema reopening and has said she wants to jump back in
and crank up the projector and dish out candy and popcorn.;    Officials also
say she is considering plans to transform the theater into a triplex to
attract more patrons.;    Changing concept;    The concept is a far cry from
the days when the theater first opened in 1915 to silent movie crowds who were
treated to live organ and piano music played on a Wurlitzer "photo player."
The photo player also featured drums and cymbals.;    The little theater first
opened on dusty North Santa Cruz Avenue as The Strand, with a ticket booth in
the center of the front of the building. In later years, the ticket booth was
reconstructed on the right side of the theater after a barber shop moved out
of the space and the cinema expanded.;    Longtime Los Gatos resident Wilma
Thompson said she remembered when kids paid a dime to see a movie back in the
late '20s and early '30s. Movie-going was so popular that the theater changed
films every two days. "This was a small town. Going to the movies was it," she
said. "We'd go to 2 or 3 a week.";    Among her favorites were the Saturday
afternoon serial Westerns, Tarzan movies, Laurel and Hardy and the Little
Rascals.;    Los Gatos historian Bill Wulf, who remembers the movie house from
his teen-age days, said he has a hard time envisioning the classic theater as
a triplex. Even though the old character of the place will be preserved, it
won't be the same if the theater is sectioned off. "It'll be like sitting in
an elevator shaft," he said. "I wonder what people will think of that."  </TEXT>
