<LEADPARA>  IN THE heyday of Verdi, Rossini and Puccini, opera houses vied to perform the
star composers' latest works before the clamoring public.;    One man commands
that kind of attention today: Berkeley's John Adams, whose 1991 opera "The
Death of Klinghoffer" was booked by six opera houses before the first
rehearsal started.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Earlier this month the low-key, local-boy-turned-star Adams was back home
briefly between conducting the Cleveland Orchestra and recording his opera
with the Opera de Lyon in France. It's that kind of life now: commissions,
major engagements, jet commutes, 15-hour days.;    At 44, Adams still manages
the aw-shucks, pebble-kicking quality that has endeared him to the Bay Area
musical community since joining the San Francisco Conservatory of Music
faculty in 1972.;    Music macabre;  Now it's Cabrillo's turn. In the biggest
coup since engaging Music Director Dennis Russell Davies, the Cabrillo Music
Festival in Santa Cruz has Adams on the podium for two weeks during Davies'
sabbatical year.;    The kind of audacity marking Adams' guest-conducting
programs around the country is being carried over to Cabrillo. Few
composer-conductors have the panache to open their festival with such morbid
morsels as their own "Aria of the Falling Body," and close with Mahler's
"Songs on the Death of Children" and Britten's "Sinfonia da requiem," after
several equally lugubrious selections.;    The edge of the new;  While Mozart,
Mahler and Britten all get attention, the Cabrillo focus is on newer music, in
which the composer-conductor offers special insights, Adams points out.;   
"It's helpful on both sides. My composing informs my conducting. When doing
music of other composers, I have a different intuition.;    "Also my
conducting informs my composing -- I'm aware of necessities, of what
instruments can and cannot do, and what can be done in limited rehearsal
time.";    The 1991 Cabrillo sojourn getting into full swing tonight could be
termed a season of mystical horizons. It offers Britten's songs on William
Blake, Adams' stunning vocal concert piece "The Wound-Dresser," his own
orchestration of Liszt's "The Black Gondola" (a preview of his
premiere-studded San Francisco Symphony program in the fall), part of
Britten's "Kingdom of the Pagodas," and Milhaud's "The Creation of the World"
(danced by Tandy Beal &amp; Co.).;    Overriding it all is the shadow of Adams'
opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer," a work based on the Palestinian hijacking
of the "Achille Lauro" cruise ship in the Mediterranean in 1985. The work will
not reach the San Francisco Opera until November 1992, but Cabrillo scheduled
excerpts and offers performances by its title-role singer, baritone Sanford
Sylvan.;    Because of the opera, a Middle Eastern theme overlays the concerts
the second weekend, with Nazim Ozel on Turkish flute and "semi-civilized tree"
(a custom-made, plucked musical instrument) Aug. 3, and a collaboration by
Group Parvaneh and Ballet Afsaneh with Turkish and Persian music and dance
Aug. 4.;    Modern melodies;  But nothing is a one-man show, not even with
Adams around. Music Director Davies collaborated via long distance in the
programming decisions. JoAnn Falletta leads the juried concert of music by
living California composers Saturday afternoon, with pieces by Ross Bauer,
David Jaffe, Stefan Carow, Allen Shearer and "the other" John Adams, John
Luther Adams.;    This Cabrillo season features prominent soloists such as
violinist Stephanie Chase and pianist Richard Goode, and finally what may be
an end to the nomadic Cabrillo life: an entry into the Santa Cruz Civic
Auditorium, thanks to a $35,000 renovation. The face-lift instantly converts
the 1,950-seat hall into a 970-seat concert site with new lighting, sound
system, grid and proscenium. All the concerts (except Aug. 28) are being held
at the auditorium.;     Cabrillo Music Festival; John Adams and JoAnn
Falletta, guest conductors; Where: Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; When: Nightly
Thursdays-Sundays through Aug. 4, with weekend matinees. Also this Sunday at
San Juan Bautista. No repeat concerts.; Tickets: $15.50-$23.50. (408) 429-3444.  </TEXT>
