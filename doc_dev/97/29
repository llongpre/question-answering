Wednesdays, 10 p.m.; (408) 298-9796; CLUBS; The very special F/X; of San Jose
nightlife; FIVE years ago, San Jose had a downtown that could rival Beirut in
terms of sheer destruction. The only difference was that life after dark in
Beirut was much more interesting. Now, more than a half-decade of aggressive
redevelopment has given the Garden City a downtown full of gracious,
broad-shouldered new buildings and inviting public spaces. And still the
question lingers: Is this a two-night-per-week party town or what?;    It's
not supposed to be like this any more. Nightlife was . . . In The Plan. It's
almost as if the architects of the New Downtown paused to admire their
handiwork in the rosy glow of a weekday sunset, looked at each other and said
"Oh, great. I thought you were bringing the boulevardiers and bon vivants . .
.";    A recent Wednesday night, 10 p.m.: The Oasis, the Heartthrob and the
Cactus Club are all line-less and listless. Marsugi's is flat-out dead, with
three people hunched at the bar. On First Street, between the Pavilion and the
Fairmont, the only souls afoot are a lone jogger and a man blowing dust in
little circles with a leaf-blower.;    But there is a flicker of light in this
weeknight wasteland: F/X. By 10:30, a hipper-than-thou collection of 45
underground-rock aficionados -- out-of-work local musicians, unreconstructed
punks and disaffected post-collegiate neo-Bohemians -- is milling about the
club's shoebox-shaped main room, waiting to see Helen Keller Plaid and the
Frontier Wives. In an hour, the crowd will swell to more than 100. With a
dirt-cheap $3 cover for two of the Bay Area's finest club bands, this is the
place to be on this particular Wednesday.;    The basic
I-Have-A-Marketing-Degree-I-Just-Look-Like-A-Skate-Thug aesthetic is much in
evidence: Young men with slick hair, ratty plaid shirts, black T-shirts and
baggy shorts. Young women with black tights, T-shirts, tattoos and serious
boots. In other words -- it was a nice crowd. Several of the men sport
scraggly little beards, knee-length dungarees, porkpie hats and work boots --
as if they had just stepped out of a Depression-era Walker Evans photo. Let us
pray Madison Avenue doesn't get wind of the Joad Look.;    The year-old club
has tried to bring innovative theater, film, dance and fashion programs to the
First Street scene with limited success. Nevertheless, the club seems to have
a strong sense of identity. And the owners seem to harbor the all-too-rare
belief that clientele -- not six-for-a-dollar schnapps specials or other
gimmicks -- is what makes a scene.;    At 10:45 the four surly youths in Helen
Keller Plaid come out fighting like a mad mother bear. Soon, the dance floor
is half-full, with 50 people just absorbing the sonic wave. The band's
brilliant Velvet-Underground-Meets-the-Replacements-on-Mars set is sweet and
strong -- the mailed fist shielding the tender heart.;    The world-weary
looks of the clubhounds melt. Dancing, hugging, beer-spilling and random
collisions occur under the strobe light. It's as if the audience's collective
memory begins to wake: This is the good stuff. This is the sound we heard and
the way we felt that very first time -- when punk rock swooped us up and
turned us into sweaty, grinning idiots.;    It was like that for the Frontier
Wives, too. San Jose's oldest alternative rock band was in fine form -- from
"Elvis Was a Spy" right through "Louis Pasteur," a tender tale of how the
great scientist learned the secret of bacteria from a witch doctor. This is
the good stuff. One-hundred-and-ten decibels of earwax-melting,
speaker-shredding rock 'n' roll -- with heart and brains and brawn.;    This
home-brewed music is rude, inelegant and not even remotely upscale. When the
city fathers envisioned glittering nightlife, it's unlikely they were thinking
of the Frontier Wives. But the native flame is hard to snuff. Smother it with
zoning restrictions and license requirements and noise abatement acts, and
still it burns.;    Winterland, 1978. The Mabuhay Gardens, 1981. One Step
Beyond, 1986. The Laundry Works 1987. And now, in the wee hours of a Thursday
morning in the heart of the new San Jose, still it burns.  </TEXT>
