FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: Semi-comic King Kong takes powerful grip - Opera

It is as though an ancient Greek tragedian has completed his trilogy and is
turning his hand to lighter things. Harrison Birtwistle, who dealt so
massively with myth and ritual in The Mask of Orpheus and Gawain, has
returned to cast a wry backward glance over similar material for his new
semi-comic opera.
A year ago it looked as if The Second Mrs Kong might not reach the stage as
intended. The Arts Council had singled out Glyndebourne Touring Opera to
lose its subsidy, but after much argument the company won a reprieve - an
outcome which is starting to look as much of a ritual as anything in
Birtwistle's operas. This autumn's GTO tour includes revivals of Yevgeny
Onegin and Il barbiere di Siviglia, with this Birtwistle premiere in pride
of place.
The idea of King Kong came from the opera's librettist, Russell Hoban. He
had always loved the film and found that the composer had, too. As a
scenario, they envisaged souls meeting in the world of shadows, each
choosing characters according to his own partiality. Hoban was obsessed by
Vermeer's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Birtwistle - true to form - wanted
Orpheus and Eurydice. Goebbels was going to put in an appearance at one
point, but then they decided against it. Other sundry dead souls include a
Texan film producer and an Indian spiritualist.
There is no logic to the story. Characters from different times and places
are thrown together, merely because their creators want to amuse themselves
seeing what might happen. The girl with the pearl earring from Vermeer's
portrait is soon reclining in a 21st-century living-room, zapping the
channels on her wall-sized television, watching repeats of old films like
Brief Encounter, a British Rail documentary and - yes - King Kong.
At first it seems that Birtwistle, tongue-in-cheek, is going to parody
himself. (The scene of the shooting, repeated over and over, satirizes the
ritualistic repetitions of The Mask of Orpheus.) Then the tone falters.
Dense mists of sound build up in the orchestra, submerging any sharpness of
mind and obscuring the words, despite the authoritative presence of Elgar
Howarth in the pit. A scene involving a computer search for King Kong is
overlong and woefully heavy-handed. A fight scene sinks to the weakest
knockabout humour.
By the interval it looks as though the opera is lost, but come the second
act, composer and librettist unexpectedly nail the right style - mythic
pretension played up one moment, brought down to earth with a comic bump the
next. Setting out in search of the girl with the pearl, Kong and Orpheus
encounter first a sphinx with a sharp ear for one-liners and then a
character called the Death of Kong, leading to a superhuman struggle of
ideas where the issues slug it out on stage. All this is more entertaining.
It helps, crucially, that now the words can be heard. Philip Langridge is
clarity itself as Kong, a bizarre addition to his gallery of operatic
portrayals. Nuala Willis is amusingly dead-pan as the Sphinx. Michael Chance
sings beautifully as the counter-tenor Orpheus, especially after he has been
beheaded (shades of Gawain). Helen Field reaches tirelessly for the top
notes as Vermeer's Pearl. Among some magical sights in Tom Cairns'
production are two haunting scenes in which Anubis rows the souls back and
forth across the waters of the underworld.
Above all, the music finds its sense of direction in the second act.
Birtwistle shapes the act in a single arc, starting Ring-like from a few
ideas swirling in deep soundwaves, through the comedy of the central scenes,
to a peroration of primeval power underpinning what I take to be the opera's
serious message: that ideas live on, even though people may die. Like so
many new operas, it asks to be seen half a dozen times, but its very
complexity means it is unlikely to get the chance. That is the tragic irony
of the modern opera composer.
Sponsored by The Baring Foundation and the John S Cohen Foundation. GTO at
Glyndebourne until October 29, then on tour to Oxford, Norwich, Plymouth,
Woking and Manchester.
