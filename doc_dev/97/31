<LEADPARA>  SO I GET the season announcement for Shakespeare/Santa Cruz, with the plays
and the actors and the dates and the prices. And down a couple of paragraphs,
I find this:;    "Megan Cole, who is playing the stage manager in 'Our Town,'
and both Hippolyta and Oberon in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' . . ."  </LEADPARA>

A SPIRITED SANTA CRUZ COMPANY PULLS THE BRITISH

<TEXT>     How nice, I think, Megan Cole, she's been at San Jose Rep (most recently,
Amanda Wingfield in "The Glass Menagerie").;    I read a little further: "New
York actor Michael Rogers . . . a respected veteran of many off-Broadway
productions . . . is playing Theseus and Titania in 'A Midsummer Night's
Dream.' ";    That's an interesting doubling, I think, Theseus and Titania. I
don't believe I've seen a production that had the same actor as . . .;    Hold
it.;    Theseus and Titania?;    Hippolyta and Oberon?!;    Wait a minute,
wait a minute. I go back and read it again. There must be some mistake.;   
But no. That's what it says.;    I read a little further: Ah. That explains
it. The director is Danny Scheie.;    The man, or munchkin, responsible for
the world's funniest "Comedy of Errors" in 1988, in which 16 speaking roles
and "several gaolers, officers and attendants" were portrayed by nine actors
and two musicians; in which a packing crate doubled as a stage, a bicycle
built for two held four and two of the actors played their own twin brothers,
both onstage at the same time, which you must admit is unusual, not to say
impossible. I mean, Hayley Mills had a trick camera.;    AND that -- to get
serious here -- is what puts Shakespeare/Santa Cruz in a class by itself.
Without being all academic and heavy, it's the Shakespeare festival that
believes in doing things a little different.;    "Henry V" with a company of
11 actors playing 44 roles. (Because director Michael Edwards decided to take
"We few, we happy few" literally.) "Hamlet" and "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead," back to back in rotating repertory. A U.S. Navy "Othello." An "As
You Like It" that picked up everything, including the audience, when the story
moved to the Forest of Arden.;    Some years, the company goes straight for
the gold: no high concept, just simple beauty. "Richard II." "The Winter's
Tale." "Twelfth Night." "Love's Labour's Lost." "Much Ado About Nothing."
"Much Ado" may have been the prettiest: An entire Franciscan mission, down to
its clay pots of impatiens and a tiny graveyard, was built in the glen next to
the Performing Arts complex at the University of California, Santa Cruz.;   
For me, it all began in 1984 when I, new to San Jose, wandered down to Santa
Cruz, got lost trying to find the festival, found it, got lost trying to find
the glen, found it -- and found there the Globe Theater, battered and
bullet-scarred, crowned with the wreckage of a snub fighter plane.;    This
was Michael Edwards' production of "Henry IV, Part 1," which knocked the
stuffing out of the stultified Britishness that Americans endure, nay, expect
as a condition of Shakespeare. The poetry was there, not in the measured
cadences of the Queen's English but in an exciting mix of American accents.
Prince Hal looked like Boy George, the king like a contemporary politician,
his generals like generals, his enemies like partisans.;    "I want the actors
to speak in their own voices," says Edwards, the 40-year-old Australian who
came here to direct "Merry Wives of Windsor" in 1983, who planned to stay two
years and instead became artistic director in 1987.;    "In their own voices"
sounds so simple, but it leads to larger iconoclasms: the willingness to take
risks, challenge the text, be just a little anarchic. These are things
Shakespeare/Santa Cruz takes for granted as its birthright.;    In the
beginning, founding director Audrey Stanley wanted to pay homage to her late
colleague, the respected Shakespearean scholar C.L. Barber, and to give
something tangible to UC-Santa Cruz students. So every summer, there have been
Royal Shakespeare Company guests, who teach and coach as well as act. Since
1985, the festival also has had an increasing complement of Equity
(professional) actors.;    The 1991 season is the festival's 10th. It opens
Saturday with (what else in a commemorative year?) "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
in the glen; continues indoors with "Our Town," the quintessential American
play, opening next Friday, and "Measure for Measure," one of the most
difficult of the problem comedies, with its opposed forces of license and
repression; and ends outdoors with the work that most defines 20th-century
art, "Waiting for Godot," in which the fragrant and shady glen will adopt the
persona of "A country road. A tree. Evening.";    All will run in repertory
through Sept. 1, with a brief adjournment Aug. 24-25 for "Midsummer" to play
at Villa Montalvo in Saratoga.;    Barber, who died in 1980, is known for a
book-length essay on the vis comica of the Bard, the lighter face of the
two-faced mask of Thespis. It's called "Shakespeare's Festival Comedies.";   
Shakespeare/Santa Cruz is the place where the festive comedies (as well as the
tragedies, the histories, the romances and a lot of other plays not by
Shakespeare) come off the page, played here as delicately as wind chimes and
there as broadly as vaudeville. In Santa Cruz, Shakespeare is shamelessly
alive.;     Shakespeare/Santa Cruz; Repertory: 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'

Measure' (opens Aug. 2); 'Waiting for Godot' (opens Aug. 9); Through: Sept. 1;
Where: Performing Arts complex, UC-Santa Cruz; Tickets: $30-$70 (season);
