<LEADPARA>  ALTHOUGH my editors over at World Headquarters think of Santa Cruz as a suburb
of San Jose, most of us here in Surf City realize we are, in fact, part of
Greater Honolulu. I suspect that I'm one of many Santa Cruzans who make more
visits to and spend more time in Hawaii every year than San Jose -- as lovely
and nearby as the Garden City may be.;    Having just returned from what must
have been my 18th or 19th visit to the Islands, I thought I'd update you on
what's been going on in Honolulu and environs in recent days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     WE got there just as the tail end of Hurricane Fefa was petering out in the
mid-Pacific. It brought some rain, followed by one of those bouts of muggy
Kona weather with no cooling trade winds to keep things comfortable. My pal
Rick Carroll, who used to work for this newspaper and now writes and does
public relations on Oahu, put a good spin on the hot, humid day, though. "It's
like a good day in Manila," he opined.;    Rick and his wife, Marcie, used to
be locals over here. Rick lived in Santa Cruz and worked in San Jose for the
Chronicle after leaving the Mercury. Marcie also worked at the Chron after
some years as a reporter for the Monterey Peninsula Herald. Both have a lot of
friends in Santa Cruz and San Jose, and both asked me to pass along their
alohas.;    Rick Carroll, you might recall, uncovered the yarn about Marty the
Marijuana Mouse, the rodent who supposedly was gnawing his way through the
evidence locker at the San Jose Police Department a decade or so ago.;   
Soon, Rick's latest book, on the great outdoor adventures of Hawaii, will be
published in San Francisco.;    Strolling along Kalakaua Avenue each day, on
the way to the shave ice stand at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, I
discovered an alarming trend that won't, I hope, make it to the mainland,
especially to Santa Cruz: large numbers of young men prowling the sidewalks
with giant parrots on their shoulders. I think some of the guys who used to
hand out time-share brochures or Hare Krishna tracts must have had midlife
career changes and gotten into birds instead.;    (There are, of course, some
shave ice outlets in Santa Cruz, but so far none has seemed authentic to me.
Instead of shaving little flakes from a big block of ice, the new machines
here -- and, unfortunately, at some Hawaiian locales as well -- seem to crush
ice cubes instead. The resulting heap of slush doesn't hold the flavored
syrups as well as the genuine article -- "da kine," as they would say in
pidgin.);    ANYWAY, there have always been one or two guys with colorful
macaws standing along Kalakaua. Their shtick is to befriend tourists, then
charge the rubes a couple of bucks if they want to take a picture of
themselves with the parrot as a prop.;    (A frighteningly high proportion of
the tourist population seems willing to part with cash in order to get a
snapshot of Mom with a large bird on her shoulder.);    A positive trend is
showing up in the Hawaiian shirt business. Aloha shirtmakers, led by the folks
at Paradise Found, are using fabrics that look and feel so much like the
material used during the heydays of the 1940s and '50s that there's really no
need anymore to look at expensive antique garments. (A good aloha shirt from
the '40s can run you several hundred dollars in Honolulu these days. I know; I
collect Hawaiian shirts the way some people collect baseball cards.);    As
always, Hawaii calls. I consider it my home away from home. When I win the
lotto, you'll probably find me in the Islands as often as in Santa Cruz. I'll
be the guy in the Mercury News Honolulu bureau, covering things for our
readers in Surf City.;    In the meantime, aloha!  </TEXT>
