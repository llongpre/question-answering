<LEADPARA>  Hoping to present design consultants and city leaders with a mental picture of
how an ideal post-earthquake Santa Cruz would look, a non-profit advisory
board of prominent Santa Cruz citizens Tuesday night unveiled plans for a
Shangri-La by the Sea.;    Vision Santa Cruz's eight-page document is the
product of six months of debates, questionnaire-collecting and public input.
Although general in tone, the "Vision Statement" is uncompromisingly Santa
Cruzan in character. It describes a rejuvenated city with sweeping
improvements in housing, cultural events, commerce and urban design, all the
while emphasizing that the new downtown serve as "a living room for the entire
city" that encourages people to get out of their cars and walk the streets
with their neighbors.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "If we don't have grand dreams, then we can't hope to achieve even the
smallest parts of them," said Laura Perry, a city planner and housing expert
who works as Vision Santa Cruz's only paid staffer.;    According to the
document, Vision Santa Cruz's rebuilt city would include:;    (check) A
pedestrian-oriented and economically vibrant central business district along
Pacific Avenue, Church, Locust and Cooper streets, comprised predominantly of
two and three story buildings but including several taller structures.;   
(check) Dense downtown housing up and down the Garden Mall that caters to
low-and middle-income residents.;    (check) Expanded cultural facilities,
including a Performing Arts Center on the banks of the San Lorenzo River; an
Art and History Museum in the abandoned jail building on Front Street and
plentiful outdoor art shows and concerts.;    (check) A streetscape rich in
native trees and flowers. Sidewalk cafes, street vending, outdoor performance
areas, and other public conveniences such as benches, planters, abundant
bicycle racks and public restrooms also are included.;    Vision Santa Cruz is
an advisory body that was formed after the quake to collect citizen input and
to make recommendations about how to rebuild Santa Cruz. Its 36-member board
includes public officials such as Mayor Jane Yokoyama, downtown business
owners, housing experts and representatives from the arts and social welfare
communities.;    The Vision Statement is available at the Vision Santa Cruz
office, 1543 Pacific Avenue, and will be open for public comment at a downtown
recovery citizen study session at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 15 at the Civic Auditorium.  </TEXT>
