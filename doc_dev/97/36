   Opera singer Enrico Caruso, asleep in the
Palace Hotel when the Great Earthquake struck in 1906, was so
unnerved by the shaker that he ran into the streets in his nightie
shouting, ``I'll never come back.''
   He caught a ferry to Oakland and never did return.
   But the artists, actors, musicians and performance managers who
experienced Tuesday's big quake vowed their shows would go on _
eventually, somewhere. Some of the promises couldn't be kept.
   ``The music or the arts, what they're about is the spirit of
life. ... It imparts something uniquely human; it kind of reminds
people that there a great richness to being alive,' ' said
singer-performer David Byrne of the Talking Heads, who is touring
to promote his new solo album ``Rei Mommo.''
   After watching television reports of the earthquake while
backstage in San Diego, Byrne canceled this week's shows at San
Francisco's Warfield.
   The concerts were rescheduled to Saturday night and moved to the
Greek Theater in Berkeley, but the likelihood of rain later forced
a cancellation there. Ticketholders were offered refunds.
   Elsewhere in the city, the cultural center of Northern
California, performers struggled through traffic jams and
cordoned-off sections of the city to attend rehearsals.
   All 106 members of the San Francisco Symphony made it to a 7
p.m. rehearsal Thursday, including 17 who battled enormous traffic
snarls on the east side of San Francisco Bay.
   ``We have a big responsibility to the community to energize,
give them the impetus to get on with their lives,'' said David
Neuman, a 31-year-old clarinetist with the symphony. ``The show in
general must go in, meaning life.''
   On the rock scene, George Clinton's weekend concerts were
postponed until December; Deborah Harry's Sunday concert was
indefinitely postponed; Oingo Boingo's concert Sunday in Santa Cruz
was canceled, and Stevie Nicks's concert Friday night was opened to
ticketholders from Tuesday's canceled performance.
   ``It doesn't seem quite right to produce an event in the middle
of a catastrophe, having people walk by buildings that have just
been condemned,'' said rock impresario Bill Graham, who canceled
nine concerts after the quake.
   Theatrical productions were disrupted, but most shows were to
resume early next week.
   Mayor Art Agnos encouraged San Francisco Bay area art
institutions to reschedule performances soon, but cautioned them
not ``rush to open before people are ready, otherwise it would e a
distraction rather than a relief.''
   The Friday and Saturday night premieres of the traveling musical
``Les Miserables'' were canceled after a water tank atop the Curran
Theater broke and drenched the stage.
   At the landmark Geary Theater, the American Conservatory
Theater's production of ``Right Mind,'' a multi-media presentation,
was ended after a giant light rack crashed onto the stage and large
plaster chunks fell from the ceiling. A recording for people
holding ACT tickets warned theater-goers: ``Be careful out there.''
   The troupe's upcoming production of a ``Tale of Two Cities'' may
be postponed, said John Sullivan, ACT managing director. Classes
for 200 students at ACT's prestigious drama school were postponed
through Monday.
   Stairwell damage to the Golden Gate Theatre forced cancellation
of the musical ``Durante'' through Tuesday.
   The San Francisco Opera's performance of Mozart's ``Idomeneo''
on Tuesday was canceled after windows and the glass front door blew
out of the War Memorial Opera House.
   The opera moved out of the baroque War Memorial Opera House
while structural engineers continued to check the building, whose
seats were littered with chunks of ceiling plaster.
   Performances were moved at least through the weekend to the
Masonic Auditorium, where only soloists would be in costume.
Productions there would have no scenery and a minimum of props.
   ``If the mundane things are not going on, at least the spiritual
things are continuing,'' said Lotfi Mansouri, general director of
the opera, which in its 57-year history had never had a change of
venue. ``We want to rally the people, and get them to look to
rebuilding. Our function is to prove to everybody that the spirt of
the city goes on.,''
   The opera and the symphony will give a free joint concert in
Golden Gate Park on Sunday, performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
   ``It's a work that contains every emotion; despair, happiness,
tragedy, hope and joy,'' said Peter Pastreich, executive director
of the symphony. ``We think all of those feelings of a disaster are
there in this music.''
   Most of the art museums in San Francisco suffered only slight
damage to priceless collections, but at least 33 pieces at the
Asian Art Museum were damaged, for a loss estimated in the
millions, according to Clarence Shangraw.
   At the Oakland Art Museum, spokesman Phil Mumma said a
4-foot-tall jade figurine toppled in its case and was broken into
several hundred pieces. He did not have a loss estimate.
   ``A lot of the pieces, even if they have a dollar value, you
can't replace,'' he said. ``You may have the money, but you don't
have the object.''
