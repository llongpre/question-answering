<TEXT>     A parked motorist opened his car door directly in Mr. Finsand's path. The
resulting crash cracked Mr. Finsand's skull and caused a blood clot that later
contributed to his death, despite two surgical attempts to save him. He was
36.;   Mr. Finsand, said one of his friends, was "an outrageously
in-love-with-life person.";   "He was full of sass and pizazz and could jolly
anybody into anything," said Patricia Carney. "He was one of those people who
can walk into any room and lift everybody's spirits and be able to talk to
anyone.";   Mr. Finsand also loved music and poetry, running, swimming, yoga
and cooking. Friends credited him with the world's greatest recipe for
vegetarian pizza. In the last year Mr. Finsand had volunteered countless hours
to EarthSave, a Santa Cruz-based environmental organization, and recently had
put together that group's soon-to-be published book catalog.;   But Mr.
Finsand's first interest was "Antiques and Fine Arts," the magazine he founded
in 1980. Editor and publisher Finsand nursed the publication from a 12-page
black-and-white newspaper to a nationally circulated, lavishly presented,
glossy production published six times annually.;   When he died, Mr. Finsand
had been working on the premier issue of "Art and Money," a new magazine
scheduled for publication in December.;   Though a Minnesota native, Mr.
Finsand graduated from Urbandale High School in Iowa. He served in the U.S.
Air Force from 1974 to 1978, then attended San Jose State University and
worked for IBM.;   Mr. Finsand managed "The Feel," a Los Gatos rock band, in
1981 and produced an album with the band. He also owned and operated the Los
Gatos Art Gallery for two years and was a board member of the Los Gatos Arts
Commission in the early 1980s.;   "He just had boundless energy," Carney
said.; (box)Born: July 15, 1955, Moorhead, Minn.; (box)Died: Sept. 28, 1991,
