<LEADPARA>  To the stirring strains of fight songs played by the Santa Cruz High School
marching band, a crowd of 200 Surf City luminaries and taxpayers gathered
Tuesday at the edge of the San Lorenzo River for a half hour of hoopla
celebrating the opening of the new Riverside Avenue bridge.;    The span,
which cost more than $8 million to design and build, is a replacement for the
bridge destroyed by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Because the damage was caused
by the quake, almost all of the tab for the project was picked up by the
federal and state governments.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On hand under gray, wintry skies, as Mayor Jane Yokoyama gave a brief
speech and cut a ribbon marking the reopening of the main route to the beach
and boardwalk, were business bigwigs, local politicos, Bay Area media mavens
and the usual smattering of people who talk to themselves.;    As the mayor
spoke, reciting a litany of thanks to various council colleagues and other
public officials and bureaucrats for their roles in putting up the new bridge,
the marquees of motels more or less isolated since the Oct. 17, 1989, temblor
beckoned from across the San Lorenzo. Operators of the Big Six, Budget 8,
Mardi Gras, Peter Pan and other beach-area motels have been marking time since
the earthquake, waiting for traffic to return across the river.;    Beyond the
strip of motels, the elegant hills and gullies of the Giant Dipper roller
coaster invited us toward the boardwalk.;    Seaside Co. officials, also on
the verge of ecstasy with the reopening of the direct route to their amusement
park, handed out chocolate-coated bridge mix (bridge mix, get it?).;    After
a fanfare from the high school band, which had played at the opening of the
old bridge in 1936, a beaming Yokoyama proudly announced that the new
structure is 275 feet long, 73 feet wide and 30 feet tall. It has four lanes,
one more than the old bridge. It boasts bike lanes, sidewalks and some
overlooks where weary pedestrians can stop for a spell and gaze down into the
shallow trickle of the San Lorenzo.;    A new traffic pattern also has been
inaugurated on either side of the new bridge -- a scheme that has drawn fire
from some Pearl Street residents who have complained that their narrow lane
has been turned into a thoroughfare.;    The new circulation plan -- which has
Ocean Street one-way northbound between the river and Barson Street -- has
diverted many motorists onto Pearl. The city's plan calls for drivers who used
to turn left off Ocean onto East Cliff to go west on Barson and south on
Riverside before turning east onto East Cliff.;    But Pearl Street has become
a shortcut.;    City employees were busy Tuesday morning handing out notices
to neighborhood residents telling them of a traffic commission meeting tonight
to look at problems caused by the new system of one-way streets. Alternatives
the commission will look at include making one lane of Ocean Street available
for southbound traffic; changing Pearl Street, Bixby Street and Canfield
Avenue to one-way northbound; or leaving things the way they are.;    The
traffic commission meeting will get under way at 7:30 p.m. at the city council
chambers in City Hall.;    The mayor cut the ribbon, the band played and
everyone moseyed across to the other side.;    The first dog across the new
bridge was Tenaya, a yellow Labrador retriever owned by Debbie Malkin.;   
First bicyclist was former Santa Cruz Councilman Bruce Van Allen. First person
to walk a bicycle across was local political activist Bob Hall.;    The first
motorist to drive across the new bridge was Jack Ownbey, 70, whose van sported
a yellow ribbon on its antenna and a small version of the Stars and Stripes on
the dashboard.;    As we walked, the rain began to fall.  </TEXT>
