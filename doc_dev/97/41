<TEXT>     'Klinghoffer' heard;    The programs will feature the first American
hearing of an excerpt from Adams' new opera, "The Death of Klinghoffer" (July
25), as well as his cantata "The Wound Dresser" (July 28), an anti-war piece
with text by Walt Whitman, who dressed wounds as a medical orderly during the
Civil War. The American premiere of Adams' "Eros Piano" will be given Aug. 2.;
   Guest artists include baritone Sanford Sylvan, for whom the title role in
"Klinghoffer" was written; pianist Richard Goode; violinist Stephanie Chase;
soprano Dora Ohrenstein, a longtime member of the Philip Glass Ensemble; and
conductor JoAnn Falletta of the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic.;    The
festival will include its first-ever dance program, featuring Tandy Beal &amp;
Company of Santa Cruz and live orchestra (Aug. 3). Traditional Persian music
and dance will be performed by Group Parvaneh and Ballet Afsaneh (Aug. 4).;   
Nazim Ozel will play a Turkish flute called a ney and "the amazing 500-string
Semi-Civilized Tree" (Aug. 3). And the festival will present a concert in
Mission San Juan Bautista by the Oakland-based gospel choir Elements of Praise
(July 28).;    After Adams, the most-heard composer will be Benjamin Britten,
with performances scheduled of his "Phantasy Quartet" for oboe and strings
(July 25); "The Arrival and Adventures of Belle Rose in the Kingdom of the
Pagodas" (Aug. 2), an excerpt from the ballet "The Prince of the Pagodas";
"Songs and Proverbs of William Blake" (Sylvan and Goode, Aug. 3); and the
powerful "Sinfonia da Requiem" as the festival finale (Aug. 4).;    The
complementary repertoire will be heavily neo-romantic, acknowledging Adams'
roots in 19th-century music. Among the major works to be heard: the late
Leonard Bernstein's "Serenade," a "Platonic dialogue" for violin and orchestra
(July 26); two versions of Franz Liszt's "The Black Gondola," for solo piano
(July 25) and orchestrated by Adams (July 28); "Kindertotenlieder" ("Songs on
the Death of Children") by Gustav Mahler (Aug. 4); and the 1947 version of
Stravinsky's "Petrouchka.";    On Aug. 1, Ohrenstein will perform "Urban
Diva," an original cabaret piece that includes contemporary vocal showpieces
such as John Cage's "Aria.";    The Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County has
raised $35,000 to turn Santa Cruz's barn-like Civic Auditorium from a
1,950-seat arena to a 970-seat concert hall, defined by an acoustical shell
and other technical assistance.;    The festival, which has performed under
increasingly cramped conditions in the Cabrillo College theater and an array
of local churches, as well as a problematic tent on the University of
California, Santa Cruz campus, will become one of the auditorium's two
principal tenants. The Santa Cruz County Symphony (which Falletta directs) is
the other.;    The tradition of San Juan Bautista Day (July 28) will be
maintained. Two concerts are scheduled for July 28 in the mission: a 4 p.m.
orchestral program and the gospel singers at 8 p.m.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; To
