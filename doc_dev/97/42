<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CRUZ; THEATER; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  'A MIDSUMMER Night's Dream," which opened Shakespeare/Santa Cruz's 10th season
this weekend, is a merry romp, though it misses the inspired lunacy of "The
Comedy of Errors" (1988), which also was directed by Danny Scheie.;    What
made "Comedy" tick was its single-mindedness. With just nine actors,
everything had to be reduced for their number. Two guys played their own twin
brothers (there being no one else to play them), and everyone took multiple
roles, which required much doffing of costumes under breakneck circumstances.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gender switching;  "Midsummer," by contrast, tries to do too many things.
Using the play as a metaphor for theater is a wonderful conceit; using it to
"prove" dubious assumptions about gender roles is less successful.;    Scheie
(pronounced shay) juices up the common doubling of Theseus/Oberon and
Hippolyta/Titania by crossing their genders, so the actor playing Theseus
(Michael Rogers) goes into drag as Titania, and the actress playing Hippolyta
(Megan Cole) assumes the mantle of Oberon.;    While this isn't nearly as
funny as the director thinks it is, the fairy attendants more than compensate.
They're played by beefy guys in scanty outfits with gauze wings pinned to
their backs. Funniest of all is their leader (Tom Graves), who mouths the
words to Mendelssohn's lullaby, using his magic wand as a mike.;    All the
nonsense of mixed-up lovers, quarrelsome spouses and the rude mechanicals
rehearsing their "tedious brief comedy" takes place on a brilliant,
self-effacing set by Mike Edwards (not the artistic director of the festival
but its erstwhile properties manager).;    It consists of a main ground
platform and several smaller ones up in the trees of the redwood glen. The
whole superstructure of the set is rope -- bridges, cargo nets, flying wires
for Puck and the fairies, a dumbwaiter to take Titania's bower (a garden seat)
up and down. It is what used to be called a hemp house -- as all theaters were
in the days before electric pulleys and winches.;    Winged stagehands;  The
production delights in its old-fashioned theatricality. Common stage tricks --
trap doors, flying harnesses, flowers with squeegee stems that douse their
victims with real water instead of fairy dust -- occur in plain view. The only
people who can't see the jokes coming are those in the play.;    It's a
terrific idea, well carried out by all hands -- and I mean that literally, for
the stagehands, who wear gauze wings over their black T-shirts and jeans, are
an indispensable part of the humor as they raise and lower the fairies with
counterweights and "fly" Puck across the glen. Emblazoned on their T-shirts is
a strange device that seems to be an insect at the pupa stage. "Of course!"
said my friend. "They're fairies who haven't hatched yet.";    The poetry gets
a tad lost in all this, and the acting suffers in some measure. This
production confirms what I've felt over the years: that Scheie needs a "second
unit director" for the actors, who get but glancing attention as he
choreographs the play around them.;    As the lovers, Luck Hari, Mikael
Salazar, Shannon Kenny and Michael Stuhlbarg play everything BIG and dramatic,
as teen-agers would. But the girls tend to get a little strident.;    The
mechanicals are a funny lot, led by Daniel Stewart's hand-wringing Peter
Quince (whose carpenter's toolbox has the legend "Petie Q" stenciled on it).
They include Patrick Chew as rotund, placid, well-named Snug and Michael
Faulkner as Robin Starveling, who never stops stuffing his face.;    They have
a short colleague named Scooter, typecast as the man in the moon's dog. A
method actor, Scooter plumbs his deepest emotional recesses to understand and
portray a dog's feelings.;    Frank Farrell, who has studied at Ringling
Brothers' college for clowns, plays the physical side of Nick Bottom well. He
isn't nearly as comfortable playing with the text, especially the soliloquy,
"Bottom's dream," which he recites as though neatness counts.;    As Puck, the
festival's founding artistic director, Audrey Stanley, is intrepid enough to
fly, but her performance is otherwise without a spark of color.;    Cole and
Rogers have an almost impossible task. Cole is the better off, for her
costumes strongly define her two identities: Hippolyta, an Amazon, becomes a
literal Brunnhilde, with blond braids and a German accent; and Oberon is cool
and asexual in a sleek navy jumpsuit with a bat-winged cape.;    Rogers, an
imposing Theseus, doesn't know whether to camp it up or play it straight as
Titania, and I think the director is to blame for his confusion.;    Funny
underwear;  B. Modern (yes, that's her real name) created the costumes. The
lovers come straight from a '50s sock hop: Hermia in plastic wing-frame
glasses, lace-trimmed anklets and court shoes; Helena in tartan skirt, prim
blouse and saddle shoes; crew-cut Demetrius in a preppy sweater. As the kids
spend most of the play in their underwear, Modern has not neglected the girls'
funny foundation garments and the boys' boxer shorts.;    After the California
Shakespeare Festival's chill and joyless production, it's great to see a
"Dream" that's genuinely funny, even if the jokes are telegraphed and the
fairies intentionally cheesy.; A Midsummer Night's Dream; By William
