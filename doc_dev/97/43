The slightness of Tina Howe's "Coastal Disturbances" may come as a surprise to 
playgoers who have heard the raves from the East. Though it is a common failing 
of daily-newspaper critics to weave skeins of high-flown praise around some of 
the most slender stage fare, one expected a work of shimmering subtleties at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
But, as revealed by an ambitious, cleverly conceived and well-directed 
production at Rancho Santiago College, this Off-Broadway import comes across in 
its Orange County premiere as a pleasant, sometimes volatile, frequently 
whimsical play that -- if it were on television -- might be labeled a soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
It depicts a week on a private New England beach frequented by three women, two 
children and an elderly couple, all watched over by a strapping lifeguard. The 
disturbances of the title reflect their feelings, a kaleidoscope of moods as 
variable as the ocean breezes of late summer. Sudden gusts of emotion ruffle 
the surface of their mundane lives, exposing failures of the past and fragile 
hopes for the future. The present seems a brief and not altogether successful 
respite from both. 
</P>
<P>
Teeming with digressions, "Coastal Disturbances" revolves chiefly around a 
romance that blossoms between outdoorsy Leo Hart, the always solicitous 
lifeguard who perches above the sand dunes on his wooden platform, and artsy 
Holly Dancer, the neurasthenic photographer who has come to the beach for a few 
days to pull herself together. Holly, having been ignored by her lover back in 
New York and denied a show at his art gallery, says she's having a breakdown. 
It's unclear whether she's serious. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the play's texture is delicate and fragile, though not what you would 
call subtle. The production excels, in fact, on the flip side of subtle with an 
environmental setting that packs a double whammy: a silky blanket of 
fine-grained sand that reaches across the stage to suggest a landscape of 
dunes, and a beachside cafe called Geoff's Snack Shack, where the audience is 
seated for the show and served real beach food (hot dogs, soft drinks and ice 
cream). 
</P>
<P>
The dual setting has the effect of drawing us into the play and bringing us 
closer to the characters: Faith, a pregnant mother, doing a bit of 
lifeguard-ogling; Ariel, a divorcee with an unruly young son, talking of her 
dried-up reproductive organs; their careening kids, Winston and Miranda, who 
take a certain pleasure in aping the adults; Dr. Adams, a retired eye surgeon, 
scavenging for seashells; his wife, M.J., painting seascapes. 
</P>
<P>
Leo, a reassuring presence, is just as ready to help unfurl a beach umbrella as 
he is to administer first aid. No task is too small, no expectation too great. 
Even when it comes to large commitments like love, he seems rock solid. Holly, 
on the other hand, is flyaway as the sand on the beach. Self-absorbed and 
fearful, she is reluctant to get involved with him. But dependable Leo has an 
instinctive fix for that, too. He playfully buries her to the neck in the sand. 
The movement of his hands on her body works like an erotic massage. 
</P>
<P>
Arlo Gates Jr. and Colleen Dunn are both well cast in the leads. And they are 
nicely supported by the rest of the company: Ralph Richmond as Dr. Adam; 
Suzanne Chapman as M.J.; Fernanda Thomas as Faith; Cindy Hanks as Ariel; Jerome 
Shelton as Winston; and Karyn Stevens as Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
It is only in the second act, with the appearance of Holly's lover, Andre, that 
the play takes a particularly awkward turn. The character rings false on all 
levels, though he is clearly intended to be a phony, out-of-sync with Holly, 
the beach and everything that is natural, true and right. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is a walking cliche. It is hard not to snicker at his windy 
speech about his family's emigration from Antwerp and how he pulled himself up 
by his bootstraps and became an influential art connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
For another, Trapper Johnson's portrayal of Andre leaves much to be desired. We 
don't believe for a minute that he is Jewish, suave or worldly. His Frenchified 
accent sounds ridiculous. His double-breasted white suit and black shirt is 
anything but chic. And for all his claims, he doesn't give the least impression 
of being knowledgeable about art or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Holly buys this egregious impostor says as much about the play's 
weakness as it does about her own flaws. It's passable if we see through Andre 
and Holly doesn't, so long as we don't take her for an idiot. But what else can 
we conclude, given her decision at the end of the play? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how many times can Leo come to the rescue? Many more, we are given to 
believe. Will Leo take Manhattan? Tune in next time . . .
