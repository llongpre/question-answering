pre-Brecht double bill at the Festival

The opera best made for Santa Fe has to be The Magic Flute: thunderstorms
are almost guaranteed to be rolling around the nearby mountains as the sky
darkens during performances in the open theatre, and Sarastro's crew are
right at home in a city whose 20th-century psychic history goes back from
the shamanic healers and Eriksonian hypnotists of today to a 1911 Masonic
temple shaped as a Moorish fantasy in strawberry mousse.
Almost inevitably, the piece is a regular here. This year's new production,
though, cut away from awesomeness and spirituality to side with Papageno's
vulgar good sense. Marie Anne Chiment's costumes were on the lurid side of
dreaminess: robes of scarlet and purple for the adepts, snowy fur and little
forehead lights that made the boys look like Christmas-tree decorations.
Reto Nickler's staging provided the pantomime that Mikael Melbye, as
Papageno, knew well how to handle. In such a context, Kurt Streit's handsome
and musically fine Tamino provided a challenge that was never resolved.
As on previous occasions, the festival's successes were in areas that the
place would not seem to suit so well. For example, nothing could be less in
harmony with this relaxed, sunny, natural city than the music of Kurt Weill,
and yet it was a double bill of pre-Brecht Weill - The Protagonist and The
Tsar has his Photograph Taken, both to words by Georg Kaiser - that provided
the Santa Fe Opera with both its novelty and its sharpest night. The
director Jonathan Eaton and his designer Robert Perdziola set both pieces in
the 1920s of their composition, and so neutralised the costume-drama
tendencies in The Protagonist (as Mr Eaton rightly pointed out, the music
speaks of Weimar Germany, not of the libretto's Elizabethan England) while
availing themselves of opportunities for a comic-glamorous look just right
for The Tsar.
Both works ostensibly have to do with persons and personae. The protagonist
of The Protagonist is an actor whose mood is swung by what he happens to be
playing. His sister, who has been his sheet anchor to truth, finds him
rehearsing a piece of slapstick, and judges this will be a good moment to
introduce her secret lover. By the time she returns, however, the play has
been changed, and she spills the news to a man wrapped up in a drama of
sexual jealousy.
In The Tsar people are clear about where roles end and reality begins; it is
the situation that confuses them. The tsar, escaping from public duty for a
moment, wants to flirt with the lady photographer whose studio he has
entered. But the photographer is a disguised anarchist, and her camera is
loaded with a pistol. All through both pieces, then, there is a weapon
waiting to go off: the febrile actor's capacity to carry out in life the
deeds of murderous revenge he executes on the stage, and the weapon in the
photographic apparatus. What makes for catastrophe in The Protagonist is in
The Tsar a joke.
Yet musically the pieces are more similar than that might imply. Writing
very much in the wake of Busoni and Hindemith, Weill shared their ideal of
music moving over its own planes aside from the dramatic continuity, and the
Santa Fe double bill pointed up how much of the familiar Brecht-Weill irony
 -the ostinatos, marches and dances, the embittered harmony - came out of
those musical exemplars and was in place before the composer met the
playwright to match him. In accordance with the precedence of pure music -
or rather of impure music - the chief glory of The Protagonist is its pair
of mime sequences: spiky wind music for the farce, and ominously seductive
hints from the cello of a slow uncurling line in the tragedy. The score was
beautifully played here under George Manahan.
On the vocal side this opera is, fittingly, a vehicle for the protagonist,
and Jacque Trussel seized it with a fury of intensity. In The Tsar, David
Malis offered a nice contrast of bluff jollity. He was also a ready Marcello
in the charming revival of La Boheme that boasted too a bright Rodolfo from
Martin Thompson and an excellent orchestral performance, perceptive and
sophisticated, under John Keenan.
John Crosby, moving spirit of this festival for 37 years and unashamed
Strauss nut, conducted a luscious Capriccio that was elegantly presented by
the director Willy Decker and designer Wolfgang Gussmann as a play of vivid
facsimiles - 18th-century ladies and gentlemen in white, ivory and silver -
within a blank space of effulgent blue. The frank realism of these people's
behaviour - their evident belief in themselves - was thoroughly beguiling,
and yet they were placed in a nowhere. They were clouds singing about
clouds.
As such they were the perfect creatures for this opera in which the audience
is invited into a long, lingering enjoyment of knowing pretence. All that
was wanted was more cream and radiance in the singing. Sheri Greenawald as
the Countess had a potentially lustrous performance checked by the need to
control flare and vibrato. Mark Thomsen and James Michael McGuire as the
composer and poet were eager young blades, without suggesting that their
music might exceed expressive need. But Richard Stilwell's amused urbanity
was entirely enough for the Count, and Eric Halfvarson was ideal as the old
pro La Roche, robustly in command of the interior theatre, the box within a
box, where he offered his dancer and Italian duettists. Whether they all
knew they were similarly on show - personae not persons - was a question
left poised exquisitely in the air.
