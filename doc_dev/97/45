<LEADPARA>  WHEN conductor Larry Granger studied with the San Francisco Symphony's Herbert
Blomstedt, he was readily confused with Larry Granger of the symphony's cello
section (who is no relation). Both had studied in the California State
University system, to boot.;    Now the confusion has ended. The conductor --
who now uses his full name, John Larry Granger -- has been named music
director of the Santa Cruz County Symphony after a two-year search.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new conductor is music director of both the South Coast Symphony in
Costa Mesa and the musical forces at Pomona College. He is also an oboist and
English horn player, a factor that might have counted with the two symphonic
players (out of seven) serving on the search committee.;    Granger will make
his debut as the new chief in the orchestra's free Pops for Pops concert
Father's Day, June 16, at Henry Cowell Redwood Park, Felton.;    GLITTERING
PRIZE -- Opera San Jose soprano Susan Gundunas, 32, won a $1,000 prize at the
Carmel Music Society Competition last month, singing operatic selections and
Aaron Copland's "Pretty Horses.";    Now coming into her own as a confident
solo opera singer, Gundunas has been getting rave notices in the lead role of
the queen Erisbe in Opera San Jose's current hit, "L'Ormindo.";    SYMPHONIES
BOOMING -- The San Jose Symphony appears to have logged an all-time record
attendance for a subscription concert during the April 5-7 run, when a fourth
concert was tacked on to the all-Mozart slate under George Cleve.;    The
ticket total for the events ran to 8,500. In addition, the Frank family --
Claude Frank, Lillian Kallir and Pamela Frank -- played four concerto solos
within 48 hours. Total: 12 Frank concertos.;    FARTHER AFIELD -- Edo de
Waart's recent stint conducting excerpts from "Der Rosenkavalier" at the San
Francisco Symphony turned out to be an opportune trial balloon for the 1992
Santa Fe (N.M.) Opera season, when Ashley Putnam will again sing the
Marshallin role. Her reviews were lackluster here, though.;    About to turn
50, de Waart is now resident guest conductor at the summerlong Santa Fe fest,
where he will also lead a new production of "Don Giovanni.";    In addition,
Nicholas McGegan will lead an original-instruments performance of John Gay's
"The Beggar's Opera." There is a "Fledermaus" revival, plus the U.S. premiere
of Hans Jurgen von Bose's "The Trials of the Young Werther," after Goethe.;   
Santa Fe has also penciled in Richard Strauss' mammoth, costly "Die Frau ohne
Schatten" for 1993, leaving only the composer's early flop, "Guntram,"
unperformed in general director John Crosby's survey of all the Strauss
operas. There's also talk of a "Guntram" mini, with singers of the apprentice
program.;    NOT-SO-MUSICAL AMERICA -- In New York City, one of America's
oldest and most important classical-music magazines may have bitten the dust.
The new owner, Gerry Ritterman, sacked the staff at Musical America, telling
the editor of the past 25 years, Shirley Fleming, that he had no interest in
classical music and planned to turn it into a general trade magazine of the
same name.;    Attracting some of the leading writers and composers since its
inception at the turn of the century, Musical America's last regular issue
will be the June-July number.;    Ritterman has a background in opera -- but
not the musical kind. He had previously been publisher of Soap Opera Digest,
which he sold to Murdoch Publishing in 1989, at a profit of $50 million.;   
COMMUNITY SUCCESS -- The 42-year-old Peninsula Symphony is one of our prime
success stories among community orchestras, averaging close to 1,700 listeners
in concerts at Flint Center and in San Mateo.;    Music Director Mitchell
Sardou Klein opens the coming season Oct. 18-19 with a Vaughan
Williams-Respighi-Bernstein program, assisted by pianist Neil Rutman. Later
programs will feature jazz guitarist Gene Bertoncini, French hornist David
Jolley and a string-competition winner. For information, call (415) 593-3745.;
   Klein says that no other musical organization gets higher annual ratings
from the California Arts Council, whose funding this year accounts for 8.9
percent of the total budget -- an unusually high proportion.;    HOLE AT THE
TOP -- The Beethoven Center will be a headless horseman in the fall. While
William Meredith is on sabbatical, the university will provide no replacement
director. That means the library will be open, and the newsletter will come
out (once), but there'll be no concerts.  </TEXT>
