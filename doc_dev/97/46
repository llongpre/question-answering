<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW; SANTA-CRUZ  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  OF ALL the gifts the University of California campus has bestowed upon Santa
Cruz, liberals and traffic among them, the most blessed may be a restaurant
called O'mei, which blends first-rate Sichuan cooking with Western
influences.;    Those influences include the decor, which eschews
Chinese-restaurant cliches; the desserts, which are heavenly; the music, which
is classic (i.e., pre-"Bitches Brew") jazz; the wine list; and certain aspects
of the cookery, such as the use of feta cheese in a red-pepper appetizer.
(Decor and music, however, are "not untypical of finer restaurants . . . in
Hong Kong and Taiwan," according to co-manager Carol West.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     O'mei is the name of a mountain in Sichuan province and a common
designation for Sichuan restaurants, according to West. This one first took
root at UC-Santa Cruz's Kresge College in 1979.;    Owners Roger Grigsby and
April Shen -- he went from Chinese studies to Chinese cooking at Santa Cruz
restaurants; she's Taiwanese and focuses largely on service -- opened a second
O'mei on Mission Street a year and a half later. In 1984, they closed the
campus restaurant.;    O'mei supplements its lengthy basic menu with seasonal
specials. At the time of our visit, these included wok-grilled lamb chops with
garlic, shrimp with corn and chilies, and roasted fresh bacon in two styles --
with seafood in a casserole, and with bean curd.;    We started with three
small appetizer plates from the selection shown us by our waiter -- braised
artichokes in sesame-pepper sauce, red peppers and feta, tofu in chili oil,
$2.50 apiece -- as well as a small ($3.95) order of rice-smoked chicken wings
and another ($3.50) of red oil dumplings, which are like potstickers.;   
O'mei's approach to Sichuan is subtle and balanced, rather than fiery,
although the artichokes were peppery enough to start one of my companions
coughing. The peppers, in a mild, faintly sweet dressing, would not have been
out of place in an Italian restaurant, while the chicken wings, deeply imbued
with smoke, would put to shame any of those coarse preparations known as
Buffalo wings.;    Our main dishes were a seafood pot with braised noodles, a
dish of chopped shrimp with pine nuts and crispy spinach, and an oddity from
the Spring Specials list, Chinese black date and sweet potato chicken. All
were $8.95.;    The seafood pot was in the Cantonese style, with thick noodles
floating in a thickened chicken broth. It was not, however, bland, and the
fish and seafood were carefully cooked. The pine nut spinach shrimp was
delicious, if a little insubstantial for the price.;    The
date-and-sweet-potato chicken was a real surprise. It came in a thick, almost
black sauce that tasted powerfully of the barbecue pit, although in fact the
chunks of chicken and sweet potato were braised. It's the dates that are
smoked, explained the waiter; their influence dominates this very interesting
dish.;    Westerners who care more for desserts than most Chinese restaurants
do will be happy at O'mei. We had an "apple blossom" ($3.95), in which vanilla
ice cream nestles among sugared won tons beneath a blanket of hot apple sauce,
flavored with cinnamon; a dark chocolate mousse laced with orange ($3.25); and
a dish of fresh ollalieberry sorbet ($2.95). They were wonderful, and left me
eager to try the restaurant's black sesame ice cream or its Odwalla orange
sorbet with bittersweet chocolate sauce.;    O'mei heads its wine list with a
bargain, a dry-style chenin blanc by Calloway for only $10 -- nice fruit, nice
acid, excellent with the Sichuan menu. "We sell a lot of chardonnays, because
chardonnays still tend to be what white wine drinkers tend to drink," said
West.;  O'mei; (star)(star)(star)(star) Nouvelle; Sichuan; Where: 2316 Mission
