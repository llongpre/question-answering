<LEADPARA>  Hoping to provide children in Santa Cruz's rough Beach Flats neighborhood with
something better than drugs and gang violence, a non-profit resource center
and the city police department are putting together a youth soccer league in
the shadow of the Beach Boardwalk.;    The Familia Center and the local patrol
officers who have volunteered their time and money to get the project off the
ground have no prior experience running a soccer program. They have virtually
no budget and even less equipment.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  YOUTH SOCCER LEAGUE BORN IN BEACH FLATS ON HOPE, SHOESTRING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/1/91, pg. 2B);  A story in Friday's
Mercury News should have said Santa Cruz's city parks and recreation
department donated $250 to the Beach Flats Youth Soccer Program. Because of a
reporter's error, incorrect information was given.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Their makeshift field, a grassy vacant lot at Third Street and Park Place,
normally doubles as a parking lot for amusement park visitors.;    But come
this summer, they say, about 40 children ages five to 12 and their parents
will participate in a casual league expected to provide not only exercise, but
an overdue boost of community self-esteem.;    "The kids here see so much
poverty and violence," said Marcos Rodriguez, executive director of the
Familia Center. "But a lot of them are great kids -- all they need is some
hope and attention.";    Rodriguez has more than a passing familiarity with
poverty and violence. Operating in Santa Cruz's highest crime area, just three
blocks from the popular Beach Boardwalk, Familia Center provides health care,
housing information and immigration assistance to the Beach Flats' 2,500
residents, 60 percent of whom are Hispanic.;    Last fall, after noticing how
many young children always seemed to be kicking tattered balls around in the
streets, Rodriguez and police Sgt. Tom Vlassis came up with the idea for a
structured soccer league.;    Because there are no large parks in Beach Flats,
Vlassis -- who has walked a beat in the area for three years -- convinced the
Seaside Company to donate the Third Street parking lot.;    When city leaders
said they couldn't run the league because of insurance liability concerns, the
Santa Cruz Police Officers Association donated $500 to buy an insurance
policy. Seaside kicked in an additional $250.;    Seaside spokeswoman Ann
Parker said the lot only is used on the busiest summer weekends when other
lots fill up.;    "We won't need to use it more than about 18 or 20 times a
year," Parker said.;    Many of the families in Beach Flats emigrated from
Mexico or El Salvador. As a result, their children often are left out of Santa
Cruz's private youth soccer leagues because of language barriers or
transportation problems.;    "These kids are somehow always left out,"
Rodriguez said. "But we've got a lot of future Peles here.";    The league
represents a bright opportunity for police as well.;    If young children can
be supervised and given a positive avenue for their energies, some might avoid
gangs, said Deputy Police Chief Mike Dunbaugh.;    A few officers have said
they would volunteer off-duty time as referees and coaching assistants, a move
certain to improve their image in the area as well.;    But the league is
still desperately in need of adult volunteers, including people who know the
rules of soccer and who can speak Spanish. It also needs soccer balls,
T-shirts and plastic fencing.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To donate time, materials
or money to the fledgling soccer league, call the Familia Center at (408)
423-5747.  </TEXT>
