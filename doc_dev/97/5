When Keith Antar Mason chose the infamous "wilding" incident that occured last 
year in New York's Central Park as the basis for a performance piece, he must 
have realized what he was up against. 
</P>
<P>
How could anyone of any race summon up a shred of sympathy for the pack of 
black youths accused of raping and nearly beating to death a white woman 
jogger? 
</P>
<P>
And yet "Prometheus on a Black Landscape: The Core," which opened Thursday at 
Highways in Santa Monica, is full of whining and ranting about the history of 
black oppression and the frantic needs of the black libido -- carryings on 
that, at the very least, make a mockery of black men who have not found it 
necessary or amusing to deprive others of their liberty. 
</P>
<P>
The attack itself is suitably horrific, with the five insolent, swaggering 
Ashanti Bloods closing in on the jogger (Erika Schickel), "beating" her and 
carrying her away as she screams in all-too-real terror and pain. 
</P>
<P>
But she remains a kind of cartoon figure, reappearing later to sob and droop in 
her downstage corner, comforted by her "spiritual" counterpart, Raina Paris, a 
shriekingly protective good-fairy figure in a blue tulle skirt. We never get to 
know her as a person, and the sole reference to her investment banking career 
-- "Tomorrow I was gonna make a kill" -- is shrilly stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
As the woodenly paced, two-hour piece lumbers along, the Bloods sometimes hang 
out in front of the stage, staring down members of the audience, or laughing in 
a witless, evil way at occurences on stage. They get to do most of the moving 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Garbed in woolly loincloths, they crumble into doubled-over postures to 
illustrate how they are "the broken people," Outfitted in color-dappled 
jumpsuits, they form a genial chorus line. In slacks and shirts, they prowl 
with scuffing, sliding movements of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Crank (Daryl A. Swann), one of the alleged attackers in this version, 
languishes in jail, where he is visited by various folk from his past and 
future. They include his impotently God-fearing father, a chic black woman 
(Alretha Rakel) who falls in love with him, urges him to greater things and 
ultimately gives him up, and Omo/Exu (Lynell Gardner), a wiry, hyperactive 
doomsayer whose body is painted with white letters. 
</P>
<P>
Wafting through the piece for no observable rhyme or reason are figures from 
Greek mythology and Western history. A black Medusa (Meri Danquah) does a 
perfunctory, pelvic-thrusting dance; another Medusa (poet Wanda Coleman) 
recites on a videotape. A white Perseus (Bruce Sanborn) is embarrassed about 
the size of his sexual organ and stabs himself in the foot with his cardboard 
sword. Crank's free-form trial at the end offers the opportunity for cameo 
testimony by Joan of Arc (Curtis York cutting a sweet, serpentine figure), an 
impossibly affected Virginia Woolf (Roxanne Beckford), John F. Kennedy and 
Angela Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Other personages are apparently Mason's own creations: KaKro (Brian Foster), an 
orotund, justice-meting vulture in a pearl collar and feathers and Drumrock 
(Keith Coleman), a leering, prancing, purple-headdressed spinoff of the 
Egyptian god Anubis. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting of camp and rage in the piece not only evades the central issue 
of responsibility for crime; it also makes for bad theater in which too much is 
regurgitated and too little is experienced afresh. 
</P>
<P>
"Prometheus" will be repeated tonight and March 1-4.
