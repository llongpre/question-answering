<LEADPARA>  THERE were two disturbing news flashes last week off the Cowabunga Wire:;   
(check) Money magazine dropped Santa Cruz from No. 51 on its list of the
country's most desirable cities down to numero 177, putting us behind
Pittsburgh, San Jose and even Fresno.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE ESSENCE OF SURF CITY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Lee Quarnstrom column  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (check) Dean Torrance, half of the legendary surfer music duo Jan and Dean,
suggested that Huntington Beach down in Orange County copyright the name "Surf
City.";    "People from Iowa want to come here to the beach. All the city has
to do is grab onto the coattails of this idea," Torrance told the city council
last week.;    One council member, probably a Republican, was skeptical:;   
"We want people who will spend several hundred dollars a day in our hotels and
restaurants," Councilman Don McAllister said. "With inland California surfers,
we're lucky if they spend $10 or $15 a day.";    "Surf City," of course, was
the title of one of Jan and Dean's biggest hits. The tune, composed by crazy
musical genius Beach Boy Brian Wilson, was more or less the anthem of the
surfer boys and girls catching the waves at Cowells and Steamer Lane and
Pleasure Point back when I first moved to Santa Cruz in 1965.;    Surf City
U.S.A., the town immortalized in the song, doesn't really exist. Surf City was
a composite California beach town of mythical proportions, a surfing mecca
where, you'd imagine, the official town motto was "Hang 10" and the waves were
uncrowded and perfect . . . and endless.;    It's true that Huntington Beach
is one of California's primo surfing locales (I speak here not as a surfer but
as an observer). And it's true that Trevor Cralle, in his excellent new book
"The Surfin'ary," defines Surf City as "another name for Huntington Beach,
California.";    BUT he also identifies Surf City U.S.A. as "the prototypical
surf town," i.e., a town where surfers can gather and live and feel
comfortable and catch some bitchin' waves, or whatever they say these days.;  
 Now, can you imagine a more prototypical surf town than Santa Cruz? Can
surfers gather here and feel right at home? I mean, is this Surf City or
what?;    Despite efforts of some elements of the Santa Cruz community to
focus tourists' attention on more highfalutin attractions such as food,
shopping, history, the arts, winemaking or higher education, we Surf City
residents know that when people think of our town, they think of surfers, the
ocean and the beach.;    I think it's all well and good if folks down in
Southern California want to think of Huntington Beach as Surf City. Why not?
After all, it is Surf City to the folks in L.A. and Orange County -- despite
beachfront redevelopment in recent years that's done away with surfer joints
like the Golden Bear, a rock 'n' roll club where long-boarding locals and
hippie hodads hung out in the good old days.;    But copyright the nickname
Surf City? That's just plain nuts!;    NOW, how about Money magazine
downgrading Santa Cruz as a swell place to live?;    Yes, the quality of life
here in Surf City may seem to have declined a tad since the town was rocked by
the Loma Prieta earthquake almost two years ago: After all, who wants to live
in a place where downtown seems to consist of a bunch of big holes in the
ground with weeds growing in them?;    But less desirable than Fresno? Have
you ever been to Fresno? Yikes.;    Holes in the ground or not, I think most
people, given the option, would choose to live in Santa Cruz unless they're in
the raisin business, don't you?;    Of course, many of us here in Santa Cruz
are pleased that Money magazine has dropped us to No. 177.;    We'd much
prefer that people move to Pittsburgh or Fresno than to Surf City.  </TEXT>
