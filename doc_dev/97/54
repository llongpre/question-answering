NOW 35 years old, the Santa Fe Opera long ago established traditions for its
short summer seasons: a strong company of young and youngish American
singers, a repertory including at least one brave new work each year - and
plastic raincoats to shield those in the uncovered part of the theatre from
the desert storms of New Mexico.
This year the new piece was Hans-Jurgen von Bose's The Sorrows of Young
Werther, which makes a fitting choice for a festival that has already given
five Henze operas their American premieres. Born in 1953, von Bose belongs
to the generation of German young Romantics who have looked more to Henze
than to Stockhausen as a model, and The Sorrows of Young Werther is very
much a German young Romantic piece.
Von Bose wrote it when he was just past 30 - it had its first performance at
Schwetzingen in 1986 - and it evinces a young man's ready identification
with the subject of Goethe's novel.
Just as Werther is so preoccupied with his feelings that he excludes events
from his mind (finally to the point of suicide, the ultimate exclusion of
events), so von Bose seems concerned above all with his responses to the
book, which becomes, in his words, 'a strange, remote idyll, something
partly nostalgic, partly threatening and always very fragile, on the verge
of vanishing, and with a touch of dreamlike escapism'.
The opera is an idealised landscape of the mind, a German romantic landscape
featuring Holderlin and Lenz along with Goethe in the libretto, Schubert,
Schumann and Mahler further back than Henze in the chain of musical
antecedents, and treasuring of youthful sentiment and feeling for nature.
More specifically, von Bose's identification is with the hero, who is
on-stage almost throughout the two acts, nearly always as the focus of
attention. The opera begins from him, from his voice unaccompanied, then
gradually joined by a 'madrigal quintet' of unseen singers who echo his
thoughts and feelings, and by a solo oboe as the piece starts to lift off.
It is with him, too, that the music feels.
When his suddenly-beloved Lotte tells him she's engaged, high woodwinds and
brass yelp and scowl in agony; when she gives him leave to visit her the
next day, the pit wells up with jubilant bell sounds. The language is one of
emotional endorsement, of coursing sympathy.
It follows that the piece needs a Werther who will compel belief and never
let the precious fabric tear. In Kurt Ollman, Santa Fe has just the man: a
baritone of radiant candour and ease, using his natural talents with all a
lieder artist's care to weld word and tone into the singleness of lyrical
declamation.
Nobody else has much of an opportunity: Werther is not interested in other
people except as analogues of himself, and von Bose goes further than Goethe
in diminishing the lesser characters. Albert, Lotte's fiance and later
husband, becomes a bogeyman who pops up to curtail any dalliance with
Werther. Even Lotte herself is just a vivacious tease: all we can see and
hear is Werther's image of her, though projected with agility and brightness
here by Charlotte Hellekant.
The characters who come more fully alive are those in whom Werther discerns
some shape of himself: the mad Heinrich (a high tenor part, made into
graceful flight by Jeffrey Reynolds), and Peasant who kills for love (Mark
Thomsen, a necessarily stouter tenor, but still light and fresh, in the
nature of the work).
George Manahan was the conductor, Francesca Zambello the director, and Bruno
Schwngal the designer. A blue wall, right across the stage, provided a near,
wide space in which Werther and his imaginings could wander, while a central
pair of doors opened out occasionally on other scenes: the music room of
Lotte, Albert and domestic contentment, or emblematic exteriors of summer
trees and winter snow. The work's fluidity - its succession to two dozen
scenes in little more that an hour and half was well matched. So too its
self-sustaining energy.
The season's other new productions were a broad, unsurprising Don Giovanni,
lit only by some of the singers (Stanfords Olsen unashamedly big in
Ottavio's arias, Ann Panagulais a nicely precise and fresh, lively Zerlina),
and a rather more alarming version of the The Beggar's Opera.
Paul Steinberg's set for The Beggar's Opera confines the action within a
long, narrowing space between two high, windowless walls of brick, luridly
painted in cream and crimson. It has the atmosphere of an underground
station, or a public lavatory: an appropriate place in which the black
creatures of Christopher Alden's production can gather and gloat.
These people, dressed in a hybrid of 18th century and modern costume
recalling some of Richard Jones's productions, take nothing seriously. At
almost every moment, there is the risk that the whole thing could run away
into mocking laughter.
This is deeply untrustworthy theatre, though lucky in Timothy Nolen's
Peachum as its presiding genius. He smiles or snarls at anyone's effort to
interpose a moral value, and yet his good humour, like James Michael
McGuire's rude heroic health as Macheath, gives the sign of a benevolence
somewhere down there in the murk.
Sante Fe's less disturbing comedies were two revivals, Der Rosenkavalier and
Die Fledermaus, both conducted by the company's director, John Crosby. Die
Fledermaus was provincial, but Der Rosenkavalier had the glamour of an
outstanding Oktavian from Susanne Mentzer. She does not have much the look
of a lad, but, with a vocal accuracy that seals richness to brilliance, she
projects a musical character of sunny confidence. It is also clear that
words and meaning are as important to her as glorious melody.
Ashley Putnam makes a sweet Marschallin, restrained to sweetness by the care
she needs to control her vibrato. Eric Halfvarson is Ochs to a tee, every
phrase, every gesture smartly tuned, a dog for opportunism and the ability
to bounce back. Otherwise this company's reputation for Richard Strauss
needs polishing.
