<TEXT>     It went over big.;   It went over so big, in fact, that drive-by viewers
jammed the streets for blocks around trying to get a look at the display.
Every yuletide you could count on a major backup on Willow Street, until 1970,
when Lima donated the whole collection to the city of San Jose, and Christmas
in the Park was born.;   The park in the title is Plaza Park, on Market Street
between San Fernando and Santa Clara streets in downtown San Jose. Beginning
tonight, some 70 mechanized displays will twinkle and turn for a crowd the
city estimates will reach 300,000 by the time all the movable bunnies, bears,
Santas and reindeer are packed up again Jan. 2. So much for the theory that
we've all grown too jaded to appreciate hometown entertainment.;   Of course,
Christmas in the Park has grown since the days when a Packard was a kind of
automobile, not the founder of one of the valley's foremost computer firms.;  
Take the displays. Only a few of the survivors date from Lima's time, says
Todd Bishop, a San Jose parks and recreation staffer whose autumns are overrun
by Christmas in the Park. Instead, over the years Christmas-in-the-Park lovers
have added to the animated scenes, which now cost between $10,000 and $12,000
to construct.;   New this year is Santa's toy shop, filled with mechanical
dolls dressed in costumes from San Jose's sister cities. Traditionalists,
however, should not fear: The time-tested displays will be there, including a
new, improved version of the beloved miniature train, which does date from
1950 and, frankly, showed it.;   In years past, says Bishop, volunteer
construction crews had to actually lay track -- as in placing ties, pounding
spikes, yelling for the water boy when a body dropped from exhaustion. It took
days. Now, the new track snaps together in mere hours.;   And displays aren't
the whole show anymore. There's Santa's Castle, where one can get a photo
taken with the grand old man; a refreshments booth, where one can get a hot
dog; a souvenir booth, featuring inflatable reindeer and glow-in-the-dark
bracelets; and 150 Christmas trees, each decorated by a different San Jose
group.;   There's also the mayor's tree lighting ceremony, at 5:30 tonight in
Plaza Park. The displays will switch on then, and will be open until
midnight.;   The annual Holiday Parade -- with marching bands, baton twirlers,
lighted floats, guys driving Model A Fords -- takes off at 5:15 p.m. Sunday
from Fifth and Santa Clara streets and heads down Santa Clara to Market
Street. Bishop estimates 50,000 to 70,000 will line the streets to watch.;  
Other Christmas-in-the-Park special events include the Sounds of the Season
youth choir concert, 7 to 9 p.m. Dec. 13; the KRON Holiday Sing-a-Long, 7 to 9
p.m. Dec. 15; the KEEN Toy Drive, which gives you the chance to drop off a toy
for a needy child, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Dec. 20; and the KAZA Latin Holiday,
featuring Hispanic music groups, 6 to 9 p.m. Dec. 22.;   Christmas-in-the-Park
displays are on and moving 9 a.m. to midnight. Admission is free. Bishop says
the displays are at their most spectacular during the evening.;   Some free
parking is available during the Christmas season in the lot on San Fernando
street between Second and Third streets.;   Other holiday celebrations this
weekend:;   (check) Los Gatos' 35th annual Children's Christmas and Holiday
parade begins at 11 a.m. Saturday at Almendra and North Santa Cruz avenues.;  
The parade, which features bands, horses, kids in costumes and, of course,
Santa, continues down North Santa Cruz Avenue to Main Street and ends at Los
Gatos High School.;   Los Gatos lights its town Christmas tree today.
Entertainment starts at 4:30 p.m. and the tree, located in Town Plaza at Main
Street and Santa Cruz Avenue, will be lighted at 5:30 p.m.;   Tonight is also
the first night for Christmas horse-drawn carriage rides in downtown Los
Gatos. The rides, $7, continue on weekends through Dec. 22. (408) 354-9300.;  
(check) Across the way in Saratoga, Yuletide at Montalvo continues from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Saturday. Admission for shopping and tea is $7.50, $3
for children.;   There's no parking at Villa Montalvo itself, and shuttle
buses leave from a variety of parking lots, depending on which day you choose
to attend. (408) 741-3428.;   (check) The San Jose Historical Museum in Kelley
Park, 1600 Senter Road, San Jose, presents A Victorian Christmas from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The celebration features a boutique, music,
trolley-car rides, Victorian vignettes acted out by museum members, a
crafts-making area for children and a visit by Father Christmas. Tickets are
$4 for adults, $3 for those 65 and older and $2 for children 6 to 17. (408)
287-2290.;   (check) A Festival of Trees/Christmas Fiesta sponsored by the
Monterey Museum of Art features 20 decorated trees, music and holiday
displays. Only groups can tour the trees, which are housed in an extension of
the museum. Hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. today and Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Sunday at the Monterey Fairgrounds at Garden Road. Tickets are $4 for the
festival only (50 cents for children under 12 accompanied by parents) and
$7.50 for the festival and the tree tour. (408) 624-1611.;   (check) And now,
think back to that turkey-dazed day a week ago, when eye published another
Christmas list -- the one listing holiday shows. We left out a production of
"The Nutcracker" ballet, a faux pas that Santa, let alone all the parents of
the kids in the corps, will never overlook.;   San Jose Dance Theater's
Nutcracker takes the stage at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts,
Almaden Boulevard at Park Avenue, at 8 p.m. Dec. 20, 2 p.m. Dec. 21 and 1 and
6 p.m. Dec. 22. Tickets are $10-$25, with preferred seating available to
season ticket holders and San Jose Dance Theater members for $30. (408)
293-5665.;   There's also a Peninsula Ballet Theatre Nutcracker, with
performances at 8 p.m. Dec. 14, 15 and 22 and 4 p.m. Dec. 21 at the San Mateo
Performing Arts Center, 600 N. Delaware St. $12-$18. (415) 343-8485.  </TEXT>
