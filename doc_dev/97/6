   In 1972, Shirley Strum found herself alone with
a troop of baboons among the spare, scattered acacia trees on the
plains of East Africa, a jacket knotted around her waist and a
clipboard in her hand.
   A graduate student in anthropology at the University of
California, Berkeley, Strum had been dispatched to Kenya to observe
the baboons. She knew little about them. And she knew less about
survival in the African wilderness.
   ``It was only total ignorance of what I was getting into that
gave me the courage to go,'' she said recently in an interview.
   Strum was supposed to stay in Kenya for 18 months, just long
enough to collect the data she would need to write a Ph.D. thesis.
Instead, she made Kenya her home.
   By 1976, her studies had grown into the Gilgil Baboon Project.
She now employs six full-time researchers.
   Strum has written a lively, personal account of the project in
``Almost Human'' (Random House, $22.50). She was in New York to
promote the book, which synthesizes the ideas she has developed
during 15,000 hours of watching baboons in Kenya during the past 15
years.
   In ``Almost Human,'' she compares the behavior of the olive
baboon, Papio anubis, to the behavior of Homo sapiens. Her studies,
vividly recounted in the book, challenge the accepted wisdom that
baboons are brute, aggressive beasts. In so doing, the studies have
changed her thinking about human nature.
   ``If baboons were aggressive, then the killer ape was where we
started from,'' she said. Early baboon studies formed part of the
underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the 1960s by the
writer Robert Ardrey that a ``killer ape'' lurks inside each of us.
Humans are fundamentally aggressive, Ardrey wrote in ``African
Genesis,'' and nothing we do can change that; we can only control
it.
   That is not what Strum found, however. She draws an engaging
picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer
negotiation and persuasion to aggression.
   The old picture was of a society in which males held all power
and used force to attain dominance. Strum found that males were
transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy
with dominant males on top. She found that females were the stable
core of baboon troops, and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy.
Females _ not males _ were the linchpins of baboon society.
   They did not, however, exert their dominance over the males.
``It turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of
roles,'' Strum said. ``Even if you have dominance and aggression in
the traditional sense, it doesn't explain everything.''
   No one suggests that the hominids, or human-like creatures, that
gave rise to humans resembled baboons. But, said Strum, if baboons
had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked
aggression, then humanity's early ancestors probably did too.
   ``It's impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were
less sophisticated than baboons,'' she said. Thus our early
ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago.
   Strum grew up in San Diego, and she had no plans to become an
anthropologist when she left home in 1965 for the University of
California. But the turmoil of those years in Berkeley made a mark
on her.
   ``As I lived through the Free Speech movement and the Vietnam
War protests, I found myself confronting, over and over, questions
about human nature, about what was innate and impossible to modify
and what was flexible and worth changing,'' she writes.
   She drifted in and out of the psychology and sociology
departments before fixing on anthropology. She fell under the spell
of Sherwood Washburn, a leading American anthropologist who had
done some of the first observations of baboons in the 1950s and
'60s. It was Washburn who said: ``Go out and watch baboons.''
   That's what she did for six years, keeping careful records of
her observations. In June 1978, at a conference on baboon behavior
organized by Strum, she presented her findings to her colleagues.
``The 10 worst days of my life followed,'' she writes.
   Other baboon watchers at the conference couldn't accept her
conclusions, or her methods. When she arrived in Kenya, she decided
to follow baboons on foot, rather than watching from a van, as her
predecessors had done. That was partly what enabled her to learn so
much about baboon society. ``Rival baboon watchers criticized me,''
she writes. ``I was `interfering,' ruining the baboons!''
   It took time, but Strum overcame her disillusionment with her
colleagues and won many of them over. As that crisis resolved,
however, she faced a crisis of a different sort in Africa: The
baboons she had come to know so intimately were in danger; the
undeveloped ranch on which they had been allowed to roam had been
sold, and it was being divided into 5-acre and 10-acre parcels. The
baboons' wilderness would soon be farmland.
   Strum and her colleagues made preparations to do the unthinkable
_ to relocate the baboons to another wilderness area. No one had
ever attempted to move a group of non-human primates from one
wilderness area to another.
   The search for a new location proved difficult, but at the last
minute a site was found. The animals were difficult to capture.
They were being moved to an area where they would have to learn to
eat new foods. Would they survive?
   They would. ``It's been a great success,'' Strum said. The
animals adapted well, and with Strum's help, survived a dry period
shortly after arriving at their new home. The success of the move
has made translocation an option for conservationists, she said.
   ``Unwittingly, the baboons had given me much over the years,
personally and scientifically,'' she writes. ``Now I had been able
to reciprocate by giving them a chance for a better future.''
