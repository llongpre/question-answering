<LEADPARA>  At 7 p.m. Saturday, the crowd was gathering in the downtown Santa Cruz
courtyard of the Nickelodeon theater. A video crew was on the rooftop next
door. Movie fans with cameras milled about. People seemed nervous, expectant.;
  Rory Calhoun, one-time leading man to Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was
coming home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rita Bottoms, curator of special collections at the University of
California, Santa Cruz library and a "major fan" of Calhoun's, was there. She
talked about how she filled boxes with Calhoun newspaper clippings as a girl,
burned them when she went off to college (too old to have a crush on a movie
star), and always regretted it. At the edge of the crowd was 75-year-old
Walter Reed, a Santa Cruzan whose acting credits included "Yellow Tomahawk," a
1954 Western in which he appeared with Calhoun. They hadn't seen each other in
more than 25 years.;   Shortly after 7:30 p.m., two shiny antique cars filled
with dignitaries pulled up by the sidewalk. Bruce Bratton, the bearded writer
and publicist who organized the event, stood on a bench and bellowed the
star's arrival.;   Calhoun, star of "The Texan" on TV and, more recently,
"Motel Hell," stepped out of a '67 Cutlass convertible. His wife, Sue,
followed and the crowd exploded with applause. "I love you!" one woman
yelled.;   Calhoun, 69, was wearing a cowboy hat, denim jacket, jeans and
black cowboy boots. His thick hair, once black, is now silver. His face is
thinner than in his matinee-idol days, but he still has those big, soulful
eyes that drove people crazy. Smiling and looking a bit overwhelmed by the
reception, Calhoun walked into the courtyard and shouted in his gravelly
voice, "Where's my cousin Tom?";   Tom Fast, of Scotts Valley, stepped out of
the crowd into a hard embrace.;   Then came the proclamations honoring the
native son who moved to Santa Cruz with his mother in 1927 when he was 5, and
grew up running through its pear and apple orchards, playing hooky in the
hills outside town with his dog Rags, and generally getting into mischief in
what he calls "a real Tom Sawyer existence.";   Mayor Jane Yokoyama said the
city was lucky that Calhoun considered Santa Cruz to be his hometown.;   "No,
I'm lucky," Calhoun answered, teary-eyed.;   Then Calhoun got down on his
knees in front of a sidewalk square of wet cement -- the way the stars have
done it at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. He leaned forward on all
fours, pressed his hands into the cement and wiggled them to leave two large
imprints. And he wrote this in the concrete: "My (hrt) is here. Rory Calhoun.
9-21-91";   "Leave room for your feet, honey," his wife advised him.;  
Calhoun stepped into the bottom corner of the concrete square. His
immortalization completed, he pumped a hand in the air, and the crowd cheered
once again.;   (hbox);   Earlier in the day, the first of two filled with
events honoring Calhoun and raising money for Santa Cruz groups, he sat in his
hotel room. It overlooked the very beach where he dug holes in the sand to
cook potatoes 60 years ago, when he was known as Francis McCown. "David
Selznick gave me the name Rory Calhoun, and those are the only two names I've
known -- except sonofabitch," he says, laughing and dragging on a cigarette.; 
 His mother, Betty, was a waitress at Tommy Rudell's coffee shop on Pacific
Avenue downtown, and they lived nearby -- right near where the Nickelodeon now
stands. The way Calhoun tells it, he was one rambunctious youngster: "You
could steal a couple of milk bottles off somebody's porch and turn 'em in at
the creamery for a nickel apiece, and maybe you'd steal four of 'em and you'd
have enough for candy for the whole day." He took his candy to the Unique
Theater on Pacific Avenue where he saw "King Kong," Buck Jones adventure
movies and lots of westerns.;   "Tell him about your dog, Rags," Sue Calhoun
says. "I think that's where he got the nickname 'Smoke.' He and that dog would
disappear -- like smoke -- up in the hills and nobody knew where they were."; 
 "I had a .22 single-shot rifle," Calhoun says, picking up the story, "and I'd
take a frying pan, blanket, some matches and a bottle, and Rags, and I'd
disappear. Didn't matter if there was school or not; I'd disappear for a few
days. Go up there and catch some trout, shoot myself a rabbit and live it up.
Then they'd bring me back, and I'd sit in the police station every day after
school for a month.";   He says he was 9 years old.;   Run-ins with the law;  
Calhoun moved to Los Angeles with his mother in 1936, was sent to reform
school for stealing cars, and returned to Santa Cruz three years later. He
attended Santa Cruz High School for three months, he says, "but I got bored
with that, so I stole a couple more cars and sold 'em, and they caught me."
The memory of the local police chief still gives him the jitters. Calhoun
returned to reform school near Sonora for another 2 1/2 years. "And that's why
I'm laughing -- when I was 17, they couldn't wait to get rid of me, and now
they're bringing me back!";   After his stint, he moved to San Jose. World War
II was on, and he worked in a defense plant in Sunnyvale. "But that was kind
of like being in jail," he says, so he took a job with the state Division of
Forestry in Felton, fighting forest fires and building communication lines.
Around St. Patrick's Day 1944, he took a vacation to visit his grandmother in
Los Angeles, and that's where his life changed.;   Waiting for a trolley in
Culver City, he was enlisted as an extra in a mob scene being filmed nearby.
He never found out what movie it was for, but "they gave me $37. I said,
'Jesus, how long has this been going on?' " Another of the extras, a hustler,
must have recognized Calhoun's good looks, because he dragged Calhoun to a
talent agency. The agency arranged a contract with 20th Century Fox for
Calhoun, and the hustler took a cut.;   Calhoun doesn't have sleazy stories to
tell about the Hollywood crowd; producers didn't cheat him, fellow actors
didn't back-stab him. Edward G. Robinson, while filming "The Red House" in the
'40s, even showed Calhoun how to position himself before the camera so that
editors couldn't cut him out of close-ups with the star.;   In the mid-'50s,
while filming "River of No Return" with Marilyn Monroe in the Canadian
Rockies, Calhoun came down with a horrendous case of the flu: "I had all the
heat on in this room, and covered myself with blankets and what-have-you. It
must've been 110 degrees in that room; I decided I was just going to sweat it
out. Well, Marilyn was the only one who'd come in there and sit with me, put
cold cloths on my head, made me hot lemon and honey. I don't know if it
helped, but it sure was nice having someone there who cared.";   Calhoun's
heyday lasted only into the '60s, but he continued making films, more than 75
in all. There were "Mule Feathers," "Angel" and more than a dozen others
during the '70s and '80s. On television he appeared on "Hawaii Five-O,"
"Fantasy Island" and "Hart to Hart." He had a leading role on the soap opera
"Capitol" from 1982-87. Nothing to bowl you over, to say the least. But even
at the height of his popularity, says old friend Walter Reed, Calhoun hadn't
taken himself too seriously.;   "Y'know, we have a deal in Hollywood -- don't
believe your own publicity," Reed says, "and Rory never did that.";   (hbox); 
 After putting his bootprints in the cement Saturday night, Calhoun signed
autographs. Then everyone filed into the theater to watch "Way of A Gaucho" in
which Calhoun played an honorable, headstrong cowboy on the Argentine pampa.
His co-star in the film, made in 1952, was Gene Tierney -- that was one
attractive couple.;   Before the film rolled, Calhoun stood onstage with
Bratton for some chitchat. The movie was made in Argentina and Juan Peron, the
dictator, took more than a passing interest in its production. Peron, in fact,
stocked the production staff with ex-Nazi S.S. troops: "They'd come over after
the war and they were all on the picture," Calhoun said. "And at night, they'd
call Buenos Aires and report on every move we'd made that day. Who got drunk,
who got -- and all that kind of stuff.";   Calhoun cracked up at that
recollection. A few moments later, to more applause, he left the stage. He sat
down next to his wife -- sharing a big bowl of popcorn -- and the credits
rolled.  </TEXT>
