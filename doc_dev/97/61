<LEADPARA>  THEY CALL FATHER RIKER A con man, but when he brought his disciples to the
Santa Cruz Mountains to build a Holy City, he had a pretty good line on
paradise.;    Rootless Californians have always been susceptible to newfangled
religions and instant communities. The promise of utopia seems plausible in
the Golden State, and if the King of Wise Men is a third-grade drop-out and
former waiter, necktie salesmen, palm reader, mind reader and patent medicine
salesman, well, self-creation is a Californian's right.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     William E. Riker built Holy City in 1919, using the life savings of his
followers to buy 200 acres on the old Santa Cruz Highway. He started with 13
disciples and worked his way up to 300, but lost the new Jerusalem when
Highway 17 opened.;    Holy City, "headquarters of the world's most perfect
government," was created as a commune but thrived as a tourist trap. Riker,
also known as the Comforter, preached his synthetic, syncretic gospel to
tourists traveling to Santa Cruz beaches, and sold them gas, souvenirs, food
and mineral water.;    In its heyday, Holy City had a restaurant, movie
theater, radio station, weekly newspaper, barber shop, print shop, hotel,
store, observatory ("The law that governs the solar system is Christianity in
the True Light/Holy City Reveals the Mystery") and zoo.;    Billboards
advertised the Perfect Christian Divine Way, familiarly known as PCDW: "Be
Sure to Visit our Museum of Philosophy: This is the Holy City: A friend to
every Man and Religion on this Earth." (Riker was a white supremacist who
wrote fan letters to Hitler.);    Disciples got food, shelter and clothing,
but no pay. Riker drove Cadillacs. Male and female disciples lived in
sex-segregated dormitories. Riker and wife No. 3, Mother Lucille, lived in a
house on the hill. (An early follower charged the women were used sexually by
the men, but the investigation ended with her suicide.);    His philosophy was
based on his revelation -- which occurred in Chico in 1907 -- that Jews were
the head and Gentiles the body of mankind, with blacks as legs and Asians as
arms.;    He ran for governor four times, using the slogan "California is a
White Man's Home," and urging a law banning blacks and Asians from owning
businesses. He didn't make it.;    He applied for the job of city manager of
San Jose in 1944. He didn't get it.;    Riker claimed he had the "true
solution for polio, smog, cancer, stroke and everything." Unfortunately, he
found, "the world is not ready yet.";    Though there was "no sin in Holy
City," there were a lot of legal battles for Riker, who was charged at various
times with everything from breach of promise and bigamy to fraud, tax evasion,
sedition and murder, but always got off.;    Holy City survived all the
scandals, but couldn't survive the 1938 opening of Highway 17, a perfect, if
ungodly, way for tourists to get to the beach, bypassing the center of
philosophy and souvenirs. Riker sold Holy City in 1957 for $64,000. The eight
surviving disciples got the right to remain with $1,000 worth of food, shelter
and clothing for eight years. Riker died at Agnews hospital in 1969 at the age
of 96, after converting to Catholicism.;    Holy City is located south of
Lexington Reservoir, across 17 from Redwood Estates. Most of the buildings
have been vandalized or burned, but a surviving structure houses the Holy City
Art Glass Gallery.;    And there's still a Holy City Zoo, using Riker's old
sign. It's a comedy club in San Francisco.  </TEXT>
