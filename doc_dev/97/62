<LEADPARA>  MATTERS OF TASTE -- KSJO-FM disc jockeys Paul Tonelli and Lamont Hollywood
gave the Winnipeg Jets a taste of California hospitality Thursday morning --
an early wake-up call designed to throw the visitors off-balance before their
game that night against the San Jose Sharks. The DJs awakened Winnipeg
defenseman Phil Housley at San Francisco's Westin St. Francis Hotel, then
proceeded to bombard him with an array of rude noises. Housley's only comment:
"Could you please call back?" He's gotta be a Canadian to be that polite. . .
. Speaking of actions in bad taste, the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk staff
handed out salt water taffy Thursday to promote coming festivals there. The
flavors: garlic and Brussels sprout. That ought to clear the beach, if not the
air.;   LOVE IN BLOOM -- Those two guys dressed in tuxedos and riding
Harley-Davidson motorcycles across the Bay Bridge on Saturday will be buddies
Roy McKinney and Charlie Black of San Carlos, heading for their double wedding
in Hayward with Joanne McAbee and Linda D'Or, respectively, who'll arrive by
helicopter. Just the latest chapter in California's continuing "Love Styles of
the Young and Mobile." . . . . Continuing romantic activity around Pearson
Communications Group of Santa Clara, too, where a third of its nine-person
staff is doing the wedding routine. Pearson associate Lisa Schrader married
Rick Schlussel last weekend in Big Sur, creative director Karen Bryant is
marrying Ron Azevedo on Sunday in Morgan Hill and associate Patti Crum will
marry James Sanchez Oct. 19 in Santa Cruz. The remaining six workers are doing
OK, reports Elaine Riggs, but it'll be nice when there's something to talk
about besides rice. . . . But some romantic topics never seem to change.
Niklaus Mueller of San Jose and daughter Lucie were going through some old
belongings Monday -- the day when Liz Taylor's wedding made Page One news --
and came across an issue of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin, dated 1959. Its
Page One news: Liz Taylor's wedding (that time, to Eddie Fisher, and do you
really think we've seen the last of those stories?).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     MAKING CENTS -- Tips for economical entertainment from Uncle Leigh's
bargain basement: San Jose's 94th Aero Squadron continues to offer quality
comedy acts -- including S.F. comedy competition winner Don McMillan on
Saturday night -- free with your dinner. "It's a lot like the way the old Holy
City Zoo used to be," veteran comedian Edie Matthews notes. . . . Mexico
City's Los Folkloristas, who perform music on more than 100 Latin American
instruments, appear Oct. 24 at Bellarmine College Preparatory in a program
that includes finger foods and drinks for only $10 (or a dime per instrument).
One catch: no tickets at the door; you have to call the Catholic Charities
immigration program at (408) 248-1445. . . . And there's San Jose Institute of
Contemporary Art's annual auction Oct. 19 at the North Second Street offices
of Battenberg, Fillhardt &amp; Wright, this year including works by such artists
as Jeanne Aurel-Schneider, Jaap Bongers, Claude Ferguson, Therese May, Robert
Milnes, Lynn Powers, Patrick Surgalski and Reid Winfrey. "A friend went last
year with what he felt he could afford for a piece of art," recalls
collector/restaurateur Erin Barclay of Scott's, "and came back with three of
them for that price." It costs $20 to get in ($15 for institute members); how
well you bid is up to you.;   SIGN OFF -- A correction on Thursday's item
about that reader-board message at a Redwood City Toyota dealership. It reads
"Checks Accepted; No Congressmen, Please," not "Sex Accepted." But isn't it
funny how easily we believe the worst about Congress either way?  </TEXT>
