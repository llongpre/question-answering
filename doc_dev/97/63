<LEADPARA>  GLORIA Riotutar, her fingernails covered with chipped gold nail polish, lets
her hand skitter among the intricate beaded earrings she's made in her art
class, held Thursday nights in the women's minimum-security jail in Santa
Cruz.;   "I wear some of them," she says quietly, touching all the earrings
briefly and then lifting one up to her ear. "But," she adds, a smile beginning
to curve the corners of her mouth, "not everything goes with green."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Deep blue-green is the color of the women's shirts and pants in the Blaine
Street jail. Riotutar's seem to have a bit of brownish clay smeared on them,
most likely from the art class she has looked forward to every week of her
incarceration.;   Before her release earlier this month Riotutar was one of
about 3,000 inmates taking part in the Arts in the Prisons Project, a
14-year-old program that brings writers, musicians and visual artists into 12
Northern California prisons and the Santa Cruz County jails.;   The work of
some of the inmate artists and their teachers is on exhibit at the Louden
Nelson community center in Santa Cruz through Jan. 2.;   "What good is it
locked up and away, like everything else concerning our society's attitudes
about prisons?" asks Ellen Davidson, director of the William James
Association, the non-profit group that contracts with the state to provide the
Arts in the Prisons Project. "This is one of the few times people on the
outside can see work done by people on the inside.";   But in this exhibit,
people on the outside can't tell exactly what work has been done by people on
the inside.;   The 46 pieces in the exhibit, which is traveling to galleries
near the prisons and jails where the art work was created, are labeled with
the artist's name, the title and the medium. But nowhere does the tag tell
viewers which artist is a prisoner and which is a teacher.;   "We felt the
work stands on its own merits," Davidson says. "That it has been made by an
instructor or a prisoner is not the foremost thing.";   However, she says, the
omission does pique viewers' curiosity, and people walk down the long corridor
where the art work is displayed, trying to guess who is inside and who is
outside.;   Some of the more technically proficient work, though, is from the
teachers. The idea behind the program is not to turn out artists who have
mastered the technical side of making art and can go to work upon release as
your friendly neighborhood painter, says Davidson.;   There are alumni of the
program who have been able to continue in art -- one former student now
teaches art in New York, another is an honors music student at San Jose State
University.;   But, in most cases, continuing in art isn't a realistic goal
when, for most artists, making a career out of art is almost as lucrative as
making a career out of running a lemonade stand.;   "We don't want to see a
bunch of clones with the same technical skills," Davidson says. "We want to
see (the inmate artists') own vision. We want to show them there's a reward in
their own expressiveness.";   To some extent, the reward can be quantified.;  
In a 1983 study of four prisons, researchers from San Jose State University
found that inmates with previous records of prison rule infractions reduced
those infractions by 75 to 81 percent after participating in the arts program.
The researchers estimated the reduction saved the state $228,522, a number, if
it held true in other prisons, that would more than pay for the program's
$500,000 yearly budget.;   In a 1987 study, researchers found that, six months
after parole, 88 percent of Arts in the Prisons participants had not returned
to jail, as compared to 72 percent of all parolees. After two years, 70
percent of the Arts in the Prisons parolees were still out of jail, while only
42 percent of all California Department of Corrections parolees had managed to
remain on the outside.;   Is it all due to the arts program, or do prisoners
who have a better shot at succeeding outside gravitate toward the arts
programs?;   Does it matter, Davidson asks.;   "We have to give (inmates) some
sort of opportunity to express themselves while they're in there," she says.
"We have to give them productive opportunities while they're incarcerated, be
it art or some other program.";   But Davidson admits that one of the toughest
questions she has to answer comes from people who ask why inmates deserve art
programs when the strapped state budget can't guarantee that every schoolchild
has an art class.;   Her answer is that there should be art in schools as well
as prisons, that art programs should be widely available. As for the cost of
art in the prisons, Davidson points to the studies, saying, "It costs you less
to provide an arts program than it costs for you to have prisoners
misbehave.";   "Creative expression is a basic entitlement, period," she
says.;   But creative expression may be one of the hardest parts of art class
for the inmates, she says. In prison society, Davidson says, it's a risk for
the inmate artists to show their feelings in any way, even through their art
work.;   There are relatively safe images, she says. Inmates do a lot of
self-portraits and reproductions of family photographs until they feel safe
enough to branch out to other subjects. Rarely, Davidson says, do they paint
or draw prison scenes.;   However, there are a few prison scenes in the
exhibit, which features the best of a wide range of work from artists spending
a couple of weeks in jail to those on death row.;   The variety of media --
paint, wood, ceramics -- is a result of the interests of the 60 artists who
work for the Arts in the Prisons program, which has a $500,000 annual budget
and is funded by the Department of Corrections. The artist in Northern
California Women's facility, for example, works with fabric. So the inmates in
her class concentrate on quilts.;   The quality of the work varies. Riotutar's
classmates are fond of working with clay, fashioning tiny snakes, skulls and
the Playboy magazine rabbit-in-a-tux logo over and over again. Inmates in
other programs have advanced to collages and monoprints with startlingly
complex details. Inmates have produced art of almost every kind, says
Davidson, except for photography (it's hard to get cameras into the prisons,
and the developing chemicals are not allowed) and masks (prison administrators
are wary of anything that could be used to disguise inmates).;   The
sophistication of the pieces in the current exhibit surprised Hartnell College
Gallery director Gary Smith. Smith, whose gallery hosted the exhibit in
September, says he was wary of accepting the show at first.;   "I was afraid
it was going to be really weird stuff," he says, adding that by weird he means
"tattoo kind of stuff with daggers dripping blood.";   "But what that had to
do with is my own biases and ignorance about what's going on in prisons,"
Smith says. "I was just knocked out (by the art) because I think that the work
stands on its own. And when you see the context in which it's made, it becomes
even more fascinating.";   The show was one of the most popular the Hartnell
Gallery has ever mounted, Smith says.;   The program itself is popular in the
prisons, too. Davidson says most have waiting lists for the art workshops, and
Lt. Mark Tracy of the Rountree Land minimum-security facility in Santa Cruz
says inmates there seem to like it.;   "I think anything out here that helps a
person have a better self-image, or better self-esteem, is a positive thing,"
says Tracy. "Whatever it is -- vocational programs, education, or art.";  
Kathleen Brandwene, a painter and printmaker who has taught in the minimum
security women's jail in Santa Cruz for two years, says the arts program does
help the inmates feel better about themselves.;   "It's the fact that they can
make something," she says. "Some of them have never even made anything with
their hands, and it feels very good to have done that.";   Riotutar, who plans
to keep making art on the outside and hopes to sell some of her jewelry,
agrees.;   "The class is really popular with all the girls here," she says. "I
guess it gives them a good feeling. It's something they did from their own
hands. It makes them feel better." (box); IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; "Edges &amp;
Space," an exhibit of work from inmates and their teachers, is at the Louden
Nelson Center Hallway Gallery, 301 Center St., Santa Cruz, through Jan. 2. The
center is open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.  </TEXT>
