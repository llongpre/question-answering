   Pop singer Julian Lennon made $450,000 on the
sale of the mountaintop home, a former Army building that he bought
just 10 months ago, according to a published report.
   In December, the son of the late John Lennon paid $1,050,000 for
the former World War II bunker, built in the Santa Monica Mountains
by the U.S. Army and later converted to a residence.
   The young Lennon sold the one-acre property for $1.5 million,
the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified real estate sources as saying
the 4,000-square-foot residence was in bad shape, with some floors
ripped out and a rude British expression meaning ``go away''
painted on the roof to discourage photographers and fans from
flying over.

   Followers threw flowers as the Dalai
Lama, newly named Nobel laureate, paid a visit to the Buddhist
Vajrapani Institute in the Santa Cruz mountains.
   About 1,000 people lined a dirt road leading up to the temple at
the tiny retreat Saturday to greet Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai
Lama, exiled leader of Tibet and winner last week of the Nobel
Peace Prize for his non-violent efforts to free his country from
Chinese domination.
   Dressed in maroon and saffron robes and riding in a gray Jaguar,
he blew a kiss to the crowd as many threw roses.
   ``If you were a Catholic and the pope came to visit your parish,
it's about the same thing,'' said John Schwartz, one of the members
of the Vajrapani community.
   After blessing the temple, the Dalai Lama delivered a message of
peace, wisdom and compassion to an audience of 2,000 in Santa Cruz.
   ``Compassion and love is the key thing. On the family level, the
national level, the international level. It is is the key to
success and happiness,'' he said from a flower-surrounded armchair
at the Civic Auditorium.

   Once upon a time, children wrote to
Santa Claus to make their dreams come true. Now, they write to
Donald Trump.
   Third-graders at Kathleen E. Goodwin Elementary School sent
letters to the billionaire developer Friday _ by Federal Express,
no less _ asking him to buy an antique carousel to save it from
being broken up and auctioned off.
   ``Dear Mr. Trumps,'' reads one of the letters, written by
Melissa Plancon. ``Please buy the carousel. We need it bad. ... All
the kids like it. You are the riches one in the country.''
   If the carousel is sold, Valerie Hacker wrote, ``it will be
bracking children's hearts because children like amusement parks a
lot.''
   Jude Harmon was hard-nosed, trying to appeal to Trump's
legendary business savvy _ and ego.
   ``It is worth more if you buy it,'' Jude wrote. ``Children adore
it. If they destroy it they will break all 5,000 kids hearts plus
my whole school.''
   Since 1927, the wooden merry-go-round has been the main
attraction at Lake Quassapaug Amusement Park in nearby Middlebury.
   The family owned park has been hit by rising insurance premiums
that the owners say make the carousel, built in 1899, an economic
burden they no longer can afford.
   The carousel is to be auctioned off Oct. 21. Recent appraisals
put its value at more than $1 million.
   A spokeswoman for Trump said Friday that the children's plea
would be reviewed by Trump's office. Trump's executive assistant,
Norma Foerderer, said Trump receives about a thousand requests a
day for charitable contributions.

Mary Poppins in the 1964 Walt Disney movie, for which she won an
Oscar.

   Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber says he's giving up
musicals, at least temporarily, to try his hand at producing films.
   Lloyd Webber said a film version of his hit musical ``Phantom of
the Opera'' could be his first project.
   ``I doubt if I'll write another musical for the theater for the
time being,'' he said Saturday. ``I would love to make a film.''
   Lloyd Webber's plays also include ``Aspects of Love,'' ``Cats''
and ``Starlight Express.''
