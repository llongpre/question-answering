<LEADPARA>  HAVE you seen Elvis Costello lately? The natty-suited little geek with the
horn-rimmed glasses and the sod-off sneer who was once the ultimate thinking
man's punk now looks like an English country bard, with a long, flowing beard
and tresses that flow over his shoulders.;    Have you heard Elvis Costello
lately? Back in '77, "The Last of the Angry Young Men" and his band, the
Attractions, set the pop world on its collective ear with his scathing,
brilliant diatribes on the deplorable state of affairs commonly referred to as
love. On his brand-new disc, "Mighty Like A Rose" (his 13th studio album),
Costello seems to have finally embraced romantic love in all its glory and
saved the bile and bitterness for songs about the environment.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Costello has 8 p.m. shows tonight and Saturday with Sam Phillips at the
Greek Theater on the UC-Berkeley campus. Tickets are $22.50-$27.50.;  ARTFUL
KEYBOARDS TICKLE THE FANCY; Kathleen Donnelly; IF YOU work in Silicon Valley,
chances are that at some time you've stared down at your fingers on the
unchanging letters, numbers and function keys and given up a silent plea: Give
me inspiration. Make these fingers fly o'er the board.;    Artists M. Goodwill
and James Erickson do not have this problem. They look at a keyboard and they
see petroglyphs, palm trees and punk zebras. So, they paint the keyboards. A
selection of their whimsical keyboards is on exhibit, appropriately enough, at
Stanford University's Center for Integrated Systems through June 17.;   
Erickson, who is married to M-for-Margo Goodwill, explains that inspiration
came in the form of a job he got designing the keyboard for a Russian/English
computer. He figured if he could design a functional keyboard with red
Cyrillic letters and black English letters, why not keyboards decorated with
shells, foreign money, precious metals? Soon, Goodwill, a painter, got into
the act, designing her own keyboards.;    The keyboards could still be
functional, Erickson says, except that the artists symbolically cut their
cords before mounting them in Plexiglass boxes suitable for hanging.;    The
Center for Integrated Systems, on the corner of Campus Drive and Via Palou at
Stanford, is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.;  SUMMER MOVIES
WITHOUT THE STARS; Glenn Lovell; AS HOLLYWOOD continues to wheel out its big
summer guns -- such star-studded "events" as "Backdraft" and "Soapdish" -- you
would do well to remember that good things continue to come in modest
packages. Etienne Chantiliez's "Tatie Danielle" (opening today at the
Nickelodeon, Santa Cruz) is just such an offbeat winner. It stars Tsilla
Chelton as an 83-year-old widow who delights in making life miserable for
anyone unfortunate enough to cross her path.;    Also highly recommended on
the art-house circuit is Jacques Fansten's beguiling "Cross My Heart" (San
Francisco's Lumiere), about a gang of moppets who conspire to keep one of
their number out of the orphanage.;    "Tatie Danielle" and "Cross My Heart"
are being adapted for American stars, but it could be that Warner Bros. is
already ahead of the competition with "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead,"
which opens June 7 and combines the world's meanest baby sitter and a teen
conspiracy to hide the old biddy's accidental demise.;  CHRIS ISAAK'S FANS CAN
WALK TALLER; David Plotnikoff; LEGIONS of longtime, local Chris Isaak fans can
be excused for walking a little bit taller these days. They were right. Really
right. For a decade, the Bay Area has talked about the 34-year-old Stockton
native as major-league talent destined for the top of the charts. For a
decade, local club audiences watched Isaak become the Joe Montana of rock 'n'
roll: An obsessive performer who makes excellence look ridiculously routine
and easy. The perennial question was: When, for Chrissake, is the rest of the
world going to catch on?;    Several months ago, an Atlanta radio exec became
fixated with the Isaak track "Wicked Game," off the long-dead 2-year-old
"Heart Shaped World" album. Within a matter of weeks, the rocker-cum-matinee
idol had the old single and the old album in the Billboard Top 10. And the Bay
Area club scene's Boy Most Likely was indisputably the biggest fish out of the
local pond since Huey Lewis and the News. Finally.;    Tonight and Saturday,
Isaak has a pair of 9 p.m. homecoming shows at the Warfield, 982 Market St.,
San Francisco. The shows, priced at $19-$20, are virtually sold out. (415)
775-7722.;  PHOTOS THAT ARE MADE, NOT TAKEN; Dorothy Burkhart; THE twist with
"Critically Situated: Photography Beyond the Bounds," the neat new show at the
San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, is that these five photographers don't
just "take" pictures, they "make' pictures. Starting with their own or
appropriated photos, they manipulate the medium and construct pieces by mixing
and matching images, overlaying pigment, adding text, collage elements, tree
branches, whatever, to shape their expression and achieve a unique effect.;   
Barbara DeGenevieve deals with the suicide of her mother; Brian Taylor
juxtaposes Egyptian scribes with modern office workers; Sara Leith employs the
female body to explore her anxieties and obsessions; Jo Whaley stages surreal
scenarios. The most effective images, Joseph Squier's make-overs of Eadweard
Muybridge's motion pictures, are as beautiful as they are powerful. 2 N.
Second St., San Jose, through June 29. (408) 998-4310.;  HAYDN'S 'SEASONS'
PLAYS IN CUPERTINO; Paul Hertelendy; WHEN Franz Josef Haydn conducted his
oratorios in Vienna, mounted police were required to restrain the enthusiastic
crowds in front of the concert hall.;    The 110-voice Schola Cantorum won't
have Haydn back on the podium Saturday, but it will perform Haydn's "The
Seasons" at Flint Center, as Cupertino audiences may try to rival Vienna's.;  
 Haydn's last major work also looks like a Schola Cantorum finale. The group
playing Flint for the past 20 years is being forced to move to Mountain View
next season for lack of available dates.;    The 190-year-old work, based on
an English poem by James Thomson, will feature conductor Gregory Wait leading
the ensemble with an orchestra of 38.;    Soloists are soprano Mary Linduska
singing Jane, bass-baritone Michael Morris as Simon, and tenor Nile Norton as
Lukas in this allegorical fable celebrating nature.;    The concert is at 8
p.m., with a free preview lecture by Bruce Lamott at 7:15 p.m. For tickets,
$12, call (415) 324-0922 or (408) 735-7464.  </TEXT>
