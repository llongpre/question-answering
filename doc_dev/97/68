<LEADPARA>  WILL a mezzo-soprano finally snatch the operatic brass ring?;    If so, look
for Patricia McAfee of San Diego to break through the dominance of sopranos in
San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Opera San Jose has featured numerous solid mezzos on stage through the
years -- Elizabeth Enmann and Rachel Louis, to name two -- but none has broken
through the sound barrier to get a season contract as resident artist.;   
It's not their fault. "It's our repertory," admits Artistic Director Irene
Dalis. The limitations of the tight Montgomery Theater prevent staging any
grand opera, most French opera, most Rossini and Verdi, and anything with
apparitions -- in short, virtually any rep having regular, meaty mezzo parts.;
   But McAfee is special, having already appeared with the Pittsburgh Opera.
The tall redhead who lights up before crowds bowled over her San Jose
listeners by a broad consensus in the recent OSJ Showcase '91, a thinly veiled
weekend of auditions for next season. What's more, she bowled over Dalis in
singing Dalis' own operatic debut number, "O don fatale.";    The bad news is
that her triumphal aria is by Verdi. And if she's picked as one of perhaps six
resident artists, OSJ will have to scramble to find enough mainstage works for
her.;    Though the opera might offer the ideal role for her, given the right
color wig, "Carmen" is out -- unless Dalis finds a new opera house,
meanwhile.;    SIGNALS OFF -- The long-awaited San Francisco Symphony recital
series debut of the Methuselah of pianists, Polish-born Mieczyslaw Horszowski,
98, remains just that. On advice of his physicians, he has canceled his Monday
recital at Davies Hall.;    He was born when Brahms was still alive, and he
gave his Warsaw debut in 1901, the year Verdi died.;    Giving sold-out
recitals back East in recent months, he established himself as one of the
longest-lived touring recitalists of all time.;    ON THE GRAPEVINE -- Look
for George Cleve's wildly successful Midsummer Mozart Festival to stretch even
farther south next summer, presenting concerts in Cupertino's Flint Center to
celebrate the Mozart bicentennial year.;    Also, European summer touring by
collegiate groups is still on the griddle, war or no war. Charlene
Archibeque's San Jose State Choraliers will spend July in England, France, and
Switzerland, leading off with a concert in London's St. Paul's Cathedral.;   
Peter Jaffe's 83-member Stanford Symphony will leave June 19 on a tour of
Prague, Leipzig, Berlin, Budapest and Vienna.;    NAMES, NAMES -- Rocker Phil
Collins won so many Grammy nominations that you could lose sight of San
Francisco's Kronos Quartet getting four of their own for their "Black Angels,"
which has enjoyed a No. 4 ranking on the Billboard classical record charts.;  
 Collins is no relation to composer and music critic Phil Collins of Santa
Cruz New Music Works. It's just one of many name duplications among area
musicians.;    Some others? There's Donald Pippin, impresario of San
Francisco's Pocket Opera, which is presenting several Mozart operas this
summer, and the conductor namesake who records Cole Porter for Angel Records.;
   "He's my age, but from Tennessee," says the 60-ish San Franciscan. "I'm
from North Carolina.";    Close enough!;    Other namesakes and near-misses
are San Francisco Symphony cellist Lawrence Granger and Santa Cruz County
Symphony guest conductor John Larry Granger (coming to Aptos Feb. 23-24); John
Williams, an Australian concert guitarist who is unrelated to the Boston Pops
composer-conductor of "Star Wars" fame; and the two Ryan Edwards of New York,
one a baritone, the other a pianist and composer.  </TEXT>
