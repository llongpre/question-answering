Chabrier operas at Edinburgh

When Emmanuel Chabrier died 100 years ago this month, he left a remarkable
early collection of French impressionists: eight Manets, eight Monets, six
Renoirs, two Sisleys and a Cezanne. This was a man who recognised an
enduring work of art when he saw it. It is just a shame that his own music
never lived to enjoy such fame.
As an antidote to Beethoven, this year's other featured composer, Edinburgh
could hardly have chosen a more fizzing tonic than Chabrier. The survey did
not go much beyond his operas, but even that is welcome. Sadly we did not
get anything of Gwendoline - a real hoot the only time when I have seen it.
But the festival did push out the boat with a concert performance of his
unfinished Briseis, which sails off full of ambition across an ocean of
Wagnerian ecstasy, only to lose all sense of direction.
The two stage productions were saved as the highlight of the festival's
final week. A couple of years ago Opera North scored a success with
L'Etoile, a spiffing piece of theatrical nonsense which has proved to be
Chabrier's nearest thing to a lasting success in the opera-house. Emboldened
by this venture, the company decided to follow up with the intractable Le
Roi malgre lui and bring them both to Edinburgh. The King's Theatre is just
the right size for serving these sweet French musical bon-bons.
After all the praise that has been heaped on the show, it pains me to say
that the company's idea of L'Etoile was wrong-headed. My teeth grated at its
cartoon-style stage designs. My stomach sank at its heavy-handed humour.
Following on from Offenbach, Chabrier came up with a new line in French
operetta, exquisitely light-headed, a little zany, more than a little
erotic, its sparkling comic score leaving little doubt how it was meant to
go. Opera North played the music in the right spirit, but turned the stage
action into English pantomime: false and two-dimensional.
Le Roi malgre lui followed on Thursday. This was a new production and the
first time that the opera has been staged in Britain. The problem has always
been its plot. Declaring that the original story is unworkable in the
theatre (a point we have to take on trust, although those who have seen it
overseas remember little that made sense), Opera North commissioned Jeremy
Sams and Michael Wilcox to weave a new libretto around the music - as Sams
remarked, like a crossword which ends with guessing the clues.
The result is inane, but in the most delightful way. As though learning the
lesson of the night before, they have let the music be their guide. When
solo cellos set a tone of heartfelt F minor compassion, the would-be king
sings of his ruined fatherland and starving people. A soprano aria with
yearning strings is matched to a text about a flower that will bloom: 'its
name is change and revolution'. Yes - the opera has acquired a social
conscience it never had before.
Sams and Wilcox have set it in 'semi-imaginary' Moldavia (though no
imagination was needed to identify the city on the backdrop as Prague).
Henri is the true successor to the throne, believed lost or dead, who now
leads a band of revolutionaries. He is opposed to a monarchy, but that does
not stop him keeping his orb and sceptre under the floorboards. When he
finally reaches his coronation, there is some indecision whether he should
be crowned with those, or a hammer and sickle.
The authors' dry sense of humour is the saving grace through all this
nonsense. Among some fine music is a heavenly Venetian barcarolle for
Russell Smythe's straight-faced Henri and Juliet Booth's Alexina, which is
as sensuous as anything Chabrier wrote. The duets seem to have inspired the
composer to give his best, as another between Booth and Rosa Mannion's
stylish Minka is a winner for two sopranos, soaring away limpidly like
Micaela's identical twins.
Somehow the plot manages to push Minka and half-a-dozen 'nymphs' into
suspenders and frilly, black-lace bodices for a cabaret number swinging from
a silver moon. There is also a gay Italian revolutionary, who divides his
time between chasing hairy Hungarians and perfecting the exploding
pineapple, a part taken with flair by Geoffrey Dolton. Justin Lavender
sounded pinched in the tenor role. Nicholas Folwell made his mark as Laski.
Jeremy Sams doubles as a producer always ready to come to the rescue with a
dead-pan sense of humour.
Add in Paul Daniel's lively conducting and the opera seems to have more wit
than L'Etoile, even though that is easily the more original work. The
Opera-Comique burnt down after only two performances of 'Le Roi malgre lui.
Opera North is risking two in Edinburgh and promises to take it to Leeds and
on tour afterwards.
