<TEXT>     The lighthouse, which should be up and operating by the end of the month --
complete with a multi-colored beacon as well as a slide show beamed from
inside onto opaque glass screens -- is the work of Robert Catalusci. The
26-year-old San Francisco artist has been building the thing since December
with plans he started to draw last summer.;    Catalusci has sunk all of his
own money into the project, along with funds he's raised from some nearby
businesses and through a Santa Cruz art group called On Sight.;    60 feet
high;  When completed, the lighthouse -- mostly built, says the artist, with
recycled lumber and plywood -- will rise 60 feet from what used to be the
basement of one of several Pacific Avenue buildings owned by the family of
City Councilman Louis Rittenhouse. So far, Catalusci, usually working by
himself but with a few occasional volunteers, has raised his tower 48 feet
into the air.;    On Sight member Mike Mandel said the lighthouse is one of
several artworks along the old Pacific Garden Mall that his group has
sponsored.;    Others include wind-driven sculptures at the former site of the
Good Times building, pieces of sculpture near the Ford's department store lot
now used as a weekly farmers' market, and the Phantom Bank, a nightly light
show on the old County Bank facade. Pacific Western Bank, successor to County
Bank, hopes to incorporate the facade, which was preserved when the rest of
the building was demolished in the wake of the Loma Prieta quake, into a new
structure planned for the corner.;    Despite financial help from On Sight and
other sources, Catalusci says he still needs money to complete his work of
art.;    "A lot of people think I'm friends with the city council or something
and am getting public funds for this," he says. "That's just not the case.";  
 A 'positive symbol';  Catalusci says he selected a lighthouse for his work as
a "positive symbol to help bring people spiritually back to downtown.";    "I
hope its beacon will guide people to a safe haven and will enlighten the
redevelopment of this area.;    "This was a place of disaster. I think this
lighthouse is a metaphor for a place of safety.";    Catalusci is not worried
about the destiny of his work of art. When the time comes to remove it so a
new building can go in, he says, he'll just unbolt the lighthouse and move
it.;    "Hopefully," he says, "I'll find someone who wants to buy it and put
it on their property, and I'll move it there and put it up again."  </TEXT>
