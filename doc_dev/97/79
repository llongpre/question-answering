<LEADPARA>  WRITING EARLIER this summer about how California has become an ethnic
patchwork quilt, I invited readers to tell me about successful examples of
community-building.;    It seems to me that's particularly important here,
where so many of us come from somewhere else. Whether we hail from Hue or
Oaxaca or Bloomington, we find ourselves surrounded by strangers, often
speaking languages and honoring customs we don't understand.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We and they alike lack the sense of history that comes from several
generations living in one place. And so, as the new Californians, we exemplify
diversity in search of wholeness. If we want a sense of community, we'll have
to earn it.;    Your responses are dramatic testimony to the many different
forms community can take. Elizabeth Seymour of Sunnyvale cited several: "We
are an educated, information-age society searching for values and common
ground through the arts. Major corporations are positioning their products in
association with fine arts. Opera audiences have tripled since 1970 and museum
attendance has grown 2 1/2 times since 1965.;    "One of the most obvious ways
to build community is by supporting our unique free library system and
explaining it to our new immigrants as well as our 'native' population . . .; 
  "Libraries are information centers today. They provide video and audio
tapes, art prints, speaker programs, children's hours, and valuable reference
services . . . You can even go to the library in search of a comfortable place
to read for an hour or so -- and maybe meet a neighbor!;    "I also recommend
a local office which builds community, Santa Clara County Consumer Affairs at
2175 The Alameda. They offer consumer education, arbitration of disputes,
referrals to proper agencies for certain problems, advice on small claims
court -- in short, free and responsive communications to people in need. What
better way to build community?";    Bill Atkins, executive director of the
Triton Museum in Santa Clara, seconded the first of Seymour's points. "I
believe that the arts can play an important role in bringing diverse groups
together to build a community," he wrote.;    U.A. Jurva, vacationing here
from Orange County, called my attention to a bakery operated by his daughter
and son-in-law, Annie and A.A. Agah. Our Daily Bread, a French bakery on
Meridian Avenue in the Almaden area of San Jose, offers a real ethnic mix, he
said:;    "The interesting thing to me is that this group, employers and
employees, speak some ten or eleven different languages.";    When I called to
learn more, Annie Agah told me she and her husband "have always wanted to help
foreigners get their feet on the ground" -- hiring people from Guatemala,
Mexico, Armenia, Ethiopia and the Middle East.;    Ann Wahlenmeier, who lives
in the Santa Cruz mountains, had this to say:;    "Communities are based on
everyone working for common causes. The Santa Cruz mountains communalize over
water, commute problems on Highway 17, schools both in Los Gatos and on the
mountain, and especially church and social outlets.;    "The annual fireman's
fund-raising barbeque and the local church harvest festival fund-raiser are
primary examples of our community spirit. No one cares how much money one
earns, in what kind of house one lives, what nationality one is, or where
one's sexual preference leans. We only care what kind of person one is.";   
It's encouraging to see not only individuals and private groups, but also some
government agencies express a growing awareness of pluralism. Andrea
Schneider, program manager of the county Health Department's Bureau of Drug
Abuse Services, called my attention to that agency's June conference, "Weaving
Community Strengths," with a focus on supporting and linking our diverse
communities.;    The county Human Relations Commission has an interest, too,
as do our schools. Administrators in the East Side Union High School District,
for example, will go on retreat Aug. 20 to talk about ethnic diversity.;    So
there you have the sampling that came in my mail. And what a wonderful mix it
is: We build community ties with the arts, with libraries, with a small
business like a bakery, with big bureaucracies like the Health Department, and
with old-fashioned church socials.;    I love it. In each case, I suspect, we
don't march out and say, "Let's build a community." We simply join with people
whose skin may be a different color, but whose interests are akin to our own
-- improving the schools, finding child care, reducing crime, raising money
for good causes, baking bread or pies. That, it seems to me, is how we become
neighbors.;     FOLLOW-UP . . . To share further ideas on community-building,
