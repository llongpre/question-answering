<TEXT>  HOW MUCH: $6 (day of show) at Last Day Saloon; $8 advance, $9 at the door at
Freight &amp; Salvage, (510) 548-1761; $10.50 at Kuumbwa, tickets at Cymbaline
Records in Santa Cruz.; WHY: If not for their flawless bluegrass/folk/country
instrumentals and tight harmonies, a Lizards show would be one long snicker.
For years they've been winning the Austin Chronicle's best "none of the above"
band or best bluegrass band with such twisted satires as "Cornhusker Refugee"
and "Hot Tubs of Tears." Never heard Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" done
with bluegrass licks? Worth the price of admission.; ...; BILLY HARPER
QUINTET; WHEN/WHERE: 9 and 11 p.m. tonight and Saturday, Koncepts Kultural
Gallery, 480 Third St., Oakland; 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Bach Dancing and Dynamite
Society, Douglas Beach House, Miramar Beach (2 1/2 miles north of Half Moon
Bay on Highway 1); 8 p.m. Monday, Kuumbwa Jazz Center, 320-2 Cedar St., Santa
Cruz.; HOW MUCH: $15 at Koncepts, (510) 451-9072; $14 at Bach, (415) 726-4143;
$13 at Kuumbwa, (408) 427-2227.; WHY: Harper is one of the most explosive
tenor saxophonists in jazz and stands among its best composers. These are his
first Bay Area appearances in three years. (Interview, Page 20.); ...; BRUCE
CONNER; Collages, ink blot drawings; WHEN/WHERE: 10 a.m.-4 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays, through Nov. 19, Smith Andersen Gallery, 200 Homer St.,
Palo Alto.; HOW MUCH: Free; (415) 327-7762.; WHY: This Beat guru and longtime
San Francisco heavy is the most independent of artists and one of the best
around. He's about to have two solo museum shows -- at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art and New York's Whitney. Here you get a feel for one of
his specialties, Rorschach patterns that are so rich and playful, they're
irresistible.; ...; THE HOLMES BROTHERS; with Fontella Bass; WHEN/WHERE: 7
p.m. Thursday, Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church St., Santa Cruz.; HOW
MUCH: $15, $13 students and seniors; (408) 459-2826, (408) 429-3444.; WHY: The
Holmes Brothers' potent blend of gospel and blues makes them one of the
hottest emerging acts in American roots-music. Bass -- remember the
barn-burning 1965 hit "Rescue Me"? -- is a gospel pianist/vocalist making her
first Northern California appearances in many years. Also on the bill: the
Birmingham Sunlights, an a cappella gospel quartet, and John Dee Holeman, an
Appalachian bluesman.; ...; WESTERN OPERATIC SELECTIONS; Baritone Hans H.
Choi, mezzo-soprano Shin Ja Kim, pianist Soo Jung Shin; WHEN/WHERE: 7:30 p.m.
Thursday, Flint Center, De Anza College, Cupertino.; HOW MUCH: $10-$25, call
the sponsoring organization Korea Vision at (408) 727-6767.; WHY: Born in
Seoul, South Korea, and now an East Coast resident, Choi is at the forefront
of the new wave of Asian singers excelling at Western music. He won two gold
medals at the 1990 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, for best male vocalist
as well as for best interpreter of Tchaikovsky's music.  </TEXT>
