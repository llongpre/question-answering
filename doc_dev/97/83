Malcolm McLaren, the art-school expellee who exacted revenge on the world by 
unleashing the Sex Pistols, came to Cal State Fullerton Thursday to warn of the 
newest youth craze threatening suburbia: "The return of etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, I might've been somewhat against it," reflected McLaren, whose 
London leather goods boutique -- Sex, it was called -- was a spawning ground 
for the Buzzcocks and Boy George as well as the Pistols in the 1970s. "But 
nowadays, I rather like the reservation of it. Etiquette is so romantic," he 
mused. 
</P>
<P>
Now 44, the one-time puppeteer of spoof-musicians Adam Ant and Bow Wow Wow 
sounded more like Prof. Henry Higgins than Svengali. Fortunes were made, sure, 
but McLaren, an intellectual as well as a fop, saw his orchestration of 
no-talent vulgarians into rock stardom as an amusing social experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept was to be good by claiming to be bad," he said of the Sex Pistols. 
"By not playing, by not turning up at gigs, we made a movement out of it. It 
was mind-blowing." 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by driving, barely intelligible anthems like "Anarchy in the U.K.," 
the Pistols released a platinum record before disintegrating with the 
heroin-overdose death of the group's bassist, alleged murderer Sid Vicious. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful to see the aristocrats of the rock industry terrified at this 
audacious and ridiculous concept," McLaren said, recalling the self-mutilating 
band's onstage razor-blade antics. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other celebrated poseur of his era, Ronald Reagan, the McLaren who 
once shaped a generation through style now finds a receptive audience on the 
lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the university lectern in his striped Oxford shirt and V-neck sweater, 
McLaren told the assembled students that when he was their age, "the thought of 
a career seemed absolutely vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Possessing no talent as a writer, musician or visual artist, however, McLaren 
realized that only one profession seemed open to him: "Plunder. I asked myself, 
could I enter the world of plunder like the great masters?" 
</P>
<P>
He found inspiration in the world of English literature. "Like Fagan, I decided 
to get a lot of little boys to do my stealing for me." 
</P>
<P>
With the demise of the Pistols -- and the fading popularity of their look -- 
McLaren turned in the early 1980s to the next fad in fashion/music: New Wave. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing New Wave more as "a new hair style" than a musical trend, McLaren 
repackaged punker Adam Ant as an 18th-Century pirate, and assembled Bow Wow 
Wow, a synthesizer dance band distinguished by its singer, a bald, half-Burmese 
13-year-old girl named Anabella. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, the admitedly non-musical McLaren was releasing records under his own 
name, and scored a hit of sorts with the square-dance novelty tune "Buffalo 
Gals," from his "Duck Rock" album. Not a composer or a lyricist, McLaren calls 
himself a "director" of music. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled his early creations somewhat uncharitably, describing John Lydon, 
nee Johnny Rotten, as "a New Wave Neil Diamond," and the ex-dandy Adam Ant as a 
pathetic failure "who should've stuck with being a pirate." 
</P>
<P>
At the Fullerton lecture, however, students seemed more interested in McLaren's 
philosophy than his colorful past. 
</P>
<P>
In seemingly random answers to the students' serious questions about the state 
of Western culture, McLaren gave cryptic clues to a Weltanschauung that 
embraces everything from rubber marital aids to Puccini operas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the lessons of the 1980s, he announced, "Girls are more 
interesting than boys. 
</P>
<P>
"They understand the word nuance. They aren't afraid to use the word pretty. I 
mean, girls aren't afraid to go into a room and say, 'Isn't this a pretty 
room,' " he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
McLaren praised the invention of the fax machine, asserting that it will lead 
to a triumph of the written word over its old enemy, the telephone 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
He offered reassuring words to Americans fearful that the United States has 
lost its place in the world economy: "All those Orientals on the other side of 
the Pacific are desperate consumers of Marilyn Monroe, rock 'n' roll and 
Coca-Cola," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly, he professed the virtues, nay the ubiquity, of posing as a 
principle of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"From the girl back in the '50s who stuffs tissues in her bra to show that she 
has a bigger bust than other girls at the prom, to the lad with electric-shock 
hair in black leather who whips himself with chains to show he's not part of 
the money pit called London -- they're all brilliant poseurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Posing is the repackaging of the form, whether you use it for a lofty 
intellectual pursuit or you use it just to get down and boogie," he said, 
adding disconnectedly, "and the form is that basic instinct of the beat." 
</P>
<P>
McLaren, who now lives in Hollywood, told The Times he is hard at work trying 
to repackage his own form. 
</P>
<P>
He has a film project, called "Waltz Darling," which depicts his hero, Oscar 
Wilde, discovering rap music on a trip to Africa in 1880. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps inevitably, he revealed a budding alliance with the corporate 
incarnation of posing, the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesomeness-based entertainment conglomerate had invited the ex-Sex 
Pistols' manager to Orange County to discuss the reformation of "The Mickey 
Mouse Club" under his guidance, McLaren said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Hollywood," he said. "They desire to stay in touch with the taste of 
the people."
