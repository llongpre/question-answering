NERDS GETTING THEIR REVENGE IN GRAND STYLE 
</P>

<P>
For decades, schoolyard bullies yanked the clip-on tie from his neck, stole his 
pocket protector and broke his black-rimmed glasses so often that only reams of 
tape held the frames together. 
</P>
<P>
But the archetypal, Grade A, never-met-a-math-equation-he-didn't-like nerd -- 
who shunned sports the way other students avoid homework -- is getting the 
ultimate revenge. 
</P>
<P>
He's becoming hip. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In malls, nightclubs and classrooms nationwide, many young adults are emulating 
the straight-arrow style of the math and science whiz ridiculed for so long. 
Shirts are being buttoned to the collar. Pant legs end before the ankle to 
reveal -- egads! -- white socks. Thick black-framed glasses cover eyes that 
often have 20/20 vision. 
</P>
<P>
"The nerd begins in the 1950s as a victim and he rises in the '80s to be a 
hero," says Richard Martin, a fashion expert. 
</P>
<P>
But if there's one thing that separates today's chic nerd from his 1950s 
predecessor, it's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the nerd has been portrayed as socially maladroit, while his more 
recent counterpart wears his mismatched plaids and high-water pants with cool 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be very self-confident and somewhat conceited to do this," says 
Christopher Pallo, a 25-year-old art director with a Baltimore publishing 
company who abandoned his preppy ways for nerd chic several years ago. "You 
know that you're not dressed like everyone else, but you still look good." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Huppert agrees. "It's calculated, it's extreme. The things are often all 
cotton, linen or silk," says the 35-year-old furniture store co-owner. "You 
wouldn't see somebody trying to pull this off in a brown textured polyester 
suit." 
</P>
<P>
Witness the birth of the neo-nerd. 
</P>
<P>
In composite form, he's an artsy intellectual, a young city dweller. He shops 
secondhand and listens to musicians like the Smiths, the Proclaimers and Billy 
Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
(Experts agree, by the way, that nerds and neo-nerds are strictly male 
phenomena. "But I'm sure Madame Curie was a nerd," says one.) 
</P>
<P>
The pejoratives for outcasts date to the early '20s, when geek first surfaced 
as carnival slang for a snake charmer and later came to mean a sideshow freak 
who bit the head off a live chicken, according to Robert Chapman, author of the 
"New Dictionary of American Slang." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evolution of Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Nerd followed in the early '50s, with dork coming into vogue a decade later. 
Although the '80s have brought us dweeb, Chapman sees geek making a comeback 
among teen-age name-callers. 
</P>
<P>
"Geek has been around for a long time, but it's finally coming into its own," 
says the lexicographer, who saw the word used a dozen years ago by students at 
Drew University in New Jersey to berate their college president. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the evolution of the neo-nerd fashion trend, however, involves more 
guesswork. Martin first noticed shirts being buttoned to the collar in the 
early '80s, after art students grew tired of the contrived fuchsia hair and 
black leather of the punk movement. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the trend had been anticipated by new wave rockers such as Elvis 
Costello and David Byrne of the Talking Heads, whose underground music helped 
introduce neo-nerd fashion to the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Flickering Image 
</P>
<P>
TV also deserves credit for upgrading the image of the geek. More than a decade 
ago, Bill Murray and the late Gilda Radner sounded the nerd alert on "Saturday 
Night Live" by playing the love-struck dweeb couple Lisa Loopner and Todd 
DiLaMuca. Today, Elvis Costello, wearing his signature geeky glasses and clunky 
work shoes, takes his latest single, "Veronica," to the top of video charts on 
MTV. And Pee-wee Herman is transformed from dork to comic darling on Saturday 
morning TV. 
</P>
<P>
Mike MacDonald, a former scientific computer programmer and self-professed 
outcast, has made a career out of the belief that "everybody, at one time or 
another, has felt like a nerd." Nearly three years ago, he created Rent-A-Nerd, 
an Illinois-based company that sends dorky-looking characters to ham it up at 
bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations and even office meetings with such 
quips as "I long for the day our pocket protectors meet" and "Hey, babe, want 
to floss in the moonlight?" 
</P>
<P>
What has really surprised this entrepre-nerd, as he calls himself, is the 
popularity of his characters, especially his alter ego, Hornby K. Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the hippest people think Hornby's cool," says MacDonald, 29. "Isn't that 
an oxymoron -- a cool nerd? But he's been called cool because he's totally 
satisfied with himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respect for Brains 
</P>
<P>
Chapman attributes the turnaround to a new reverence for intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"The cycle that we capsulized with the Me Generation, which was extremely 
hedonistic and basically anti-work, may be turning around a bit. Now that we're 
losing our primacy in technology, we've tried to stimulate pride and sound the 
alarm. The one thing that has happened has been that the image of the eggheady 
guy with the helicopter cap on his head has changed to someone who isn't quite 
as repulsive." 
</P>
<P>
If society is beginning to re-evaluate the importance of technology, it also 
seems to be redefining its norms for male beauty. And what once might have been 
considered unattractive has done an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that it's difficult today to define what the norms of 
male beauty are," Martin says. "With the male stars of the '30s or '40s, 
everyone knew: It had to be the Latin lover or the blond god. Today, there's a 
certain body-aware type -- a (Sylvester) Stallone or (Patrick) Swayze. . . . 
But there's also more latitude." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Rueful Confession 
</P>
<P>
As neo-nerd fashions enter the mainstream, many who observe the trend can't 
help but see the paradox in transforming once-dorky attire into high fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"The validation or redemption element is part of the irony," Chapman says. 
"(Neo-nerds are making) this one rueful confession: 'Yeah, you nerds were right 
about something, but I'm also right. This requires that I not dress exactly 
like you. I'll wear these few tokens, but I'm still behaving in a cool way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martin is the curator of "From Jocks to Nerds," a recent exhibit chronicling 
men's fashion trends at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, who 
recalls spending his adolescence in "funny short-sleeved shirts buttoned to the 
collar." For former nerds like him, the popularity of the neo-nerd style does 
have a special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel vindicated," he says. "The nerd can have some kind of 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
But have things improved for the stereotypical dork -- the young physicist or 
budding mathematician who lives for final exam week? 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't done a . . . thing," says Rent-A-Nerd owner MacDonald. "Kids are 
still kids. Everyone still picks on the (real) nerds."
