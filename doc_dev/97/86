Francisco ($14, 415-621-3330) and Monday at 8 p.m. at Kuumbwa Jazz Center,
320-2 Cedar St., Santa Cruz ($12, (408) 427-2227).; -- Nora Villagran; DANCER
CELEBRATES DUNCAN'S LEGACY; LORI BELILOVE specializes in keeping alive the
legacy of Isadora Duncan, whose unfettered movements and garments gave birth
to modern dance. As part of the opening weekend of the 1991 Bay Area Dance
Series, she'll perform dances of Duncan as well as works by two Americans from
the school of another dance pioneer, Doris Humphrey.;    Belilove will perform
"To the West" and "Song of Earth" by Eleanor King, who danced in Humphrey and
Charles Weidman's company and began choreographing for the ensemble known as
"The Little Group" (Jose Limon, Ernestine Stodelle and Leticia Ide) in the
'30s. She will also dance two settings -- one by King and one by Stodelle --
of the song "Die Passionnen" ("The Passionate One") by Hermann Reutter. King's
is called "Mother of Tears" and Stodelle's "Mother of Vengeance.";    Also on
the program: "The Crossing" from Duncan's "Impressions of Soviet Russia.";   
Belilove will perform at 3 and 8 p.m. Sunday in the theater of Laney College,
900 Fallon St., Oakland. (Take the Oak Street exit from I-880.) $10-$12. (415)
748-3141.; -- Judith Green; A PRIMARY SOURCE OF MODERN ART; WITH Burgoyne
Diller it's more right angles, flat planes of primary colors and a ladderlike
intersection of bars. If you're expecting repetition you won't be
disappointed.;    An exhibit of Diller's paintings at Harcourts Gallery,
constructions and drawings from 1933 to 1945, emphasizes his accomplishments
and contributions to modernism's geometric abstraction.;    As a follower of
Mondrian, Diller (1906-1965) embraced the straight line and wouldn't let go.
However, he pushed and pulled his horizontals and verticals to open up space.
Geometric abstraction is getting a lot of attention today, and Diller's work
still looks very fresh.;     There's a certain poetry in linear forms, and,
what's more, the perfection and harmony of such art serves as an antidote to
this nutty, suicidal world.;    The exhibit continues at Harcourts Gallery,
460 Bush St., San Francisco through Feb. 9. Hours are 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays. (415) 421-3428.; -- Dorothy Burkhart; BELLAMYS STAY ON A
STEADY COURSE; UNLIKE commercial pop music's flavor-of-the-week system of
marketing, the country scene doesn't turn its back on the warhorses who hammer
out jukebox standards year after year. Old kids on the block such as Howard
and David Bellamy can still pack 'em in week after week.;    Over the course
of 16 years, 17 albums and a dozen No. 1 singles on the country charts, the
Bellamys have earned a reputation for consistently good songwriting. The
Florida brothers have also earned a rep for working outside the orthodox
Nashville formulas.;    Maybe the Bellamys will never reach the mass-market
stratosphere where the Alabamas of this world tread. But with their
environmental lyrics and myriad non-country influences, they've already made
their indelible mark on the genre.;    Monday, the Bellamys have an 8 p.m.
show at the Saddle Rack, 1310 Auzerais Ave., San Jose, with the California
Cowboys. Tickets are $8 advance. (408) 998-2277, (415) 867-2277.; -- David
Plotnikoff; SMALL THEATERS, LARGE EFFORTS; THERE is a handful of interesting
new productions of a smaller scale, worth a trip if you are in the area.;   
In Salinas, the Western Stage opens its season Saturday with two one-act plays
in the Studio Theater of Hartnell College: "Tell Me on a Sunday" and "21-A."
Judy Orlandella stars in the first play, which includes songs by Andrew Lloyd
Webber. The plays run through Feb. 9. Call: (408) 755-6816.;    In Berkeley,
the Pacific Jewish Theater opens William Hanley's "Slow Dance on the Killing
Ground" Wednesday. It continues through Feb. 10 with Bernie Segal, Sibi Soroka
and JoAnne Winter in the cast. The 1964 drama, directed by Julian
Lopez-Morillas, deals with guilt and responsibility and was a Broadway hit
when it first opened. (415) 849-0550.;    Next Friday in Santa Cruz, the local
Actors Theater opens Dori Appel's "Fun House Mirror" at the Art Center.
"Mirror" premiered in 1989 in Ashland and has also been seen at Boston's Back
Alley Theater. The play, a contemporary tale of two sisters and a gay friend,
stars Jessie Miller, Patty Free and Steban. The production runs weekends
through March 3. Call (408)-425-1003.; -- Murry Frymer; GARCIA DELIVERS DOSE
OF THE DEAD; JUST in case you didn't make it to the Grateful Dead shows at the
Oakland Coliseum in December, and/or you can't wait until their next series of
shows there in February, not to fear. Good old Jerry Garcia and his band will
play the Warfield, 982 Market St., San Francisco, at 8 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.;    It is an electric version of the group -- as opposed to the
myriad other versions that the eclectic Garcia engages in with his mates. It's
about as close to the Dead as the fans can get until the real thing comes by
again.;    -- Harry Sumrall; CUSTOM-MADE FOR MUSIC OF MOZART; FORTEPIANO, any
one?;    Now two years overdue, New York instrument maker Richard Hester has
worked long and hard perfecting this forerunner of the modern piano.;    James
Goldsworthy will take the instrument through its paces in a Mozart
lecture-concert with songs by mezzo-soprano Miriam Abramowitsch, and piano by
faculty member George Barth. It's at 8 p.m. in Stanford's Campbell Recital
Hall. $8. (415) 723-4317.; -- Paul Hertelendy  </TEXT>
