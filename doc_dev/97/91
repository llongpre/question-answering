<LEADPARA>  Ask Santa Cruz old-timers where they learned to swim, and they'll quite likely
tell you fondly about the Plunge at the Boardwalk.;    Once a grand, popular,
heated saltwater pool where generations of local boys and girls learned to
tread water and dog paddle and swim, the building that housed the old
natatorium was most recently a miniature golf course. It reopens this spring
as an entertainment emporium to be called Neptune's Kingdom.;    The name
harkens back to the original Neptune Casino, built on the same seashore site
in 1904, only to burn to the ground the next year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, said Boardwalk General Manager Ed Hutton, Neptune's Kingdom will
provide a state-of-the-art, year-round entertainment center. Designed around a
Treasure Island motif, the latest incarnation of the old Plunge building will
include a game room with pool tables, Foosball tables, a video arcade, the
distorting mirrors from the Boardwalk's original fun house, a history center
with old photos of the amusement park -- and a high-tech, multilevel miniature
golf course.;    The new golf course will feature electronic displays,
robotics, fiber-optic special effects such as an erupting volcano backdrop and
"exploding" cannons and powder kegs, said Boardwalk spokeswoman Ann Parker. It
replaces a golf course damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake.;    Plans for
Neptune's Kingdom had already been drawn prior to Oct. 17, 1989, Hutton said.
But the damage caused by the 7.1 earthquake precipitated development of the
up-to-date amusement center.;    Hutton said Neptune's Kingdom will be open by
mid-May, about a month and a half after the promised reopening of the
Riverside Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River.;    Hutton said city
officials have promised that the span, also closed for rebuilding since the
quake, will be open by the busy Easter weekend.;    A new traffic routing
pattern for the beach area -- to replace the temporary system instituted after
the quake damaged or destroyed three local bridges -- will also be developed
in time for the Easter weekend, Hutton said.  </TEXT>
