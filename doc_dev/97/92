<LEADPARA>  THE Cabrillo Music Festival is off and running again with what sounds like a
broken record: a new hall, expressive premieres, impressive symphonic music
and depressing acoustics.;    The festival's chancy firsts in soloists,
composer-in-residence, conductor and repertory came off resoundingly at the
prelude concert Thursday, though the new symphony hall is anything but
resounding.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Composer-conductor John Adams' docu-operas "Nixon in China" (1987) and "The
Death of Klinghoffer" (1991) rank as the most talked-about in decades. He
changed styles between them, from a synthesizer-led minimalism in the first to
a diaphanous, non-synthesized orchestration prevalent in the second. In both,
the vocal lyricism, the unambiguous tonality and the importance of understood
text were hallmarks.;    Thursday provided the U.S. premieres of two arias
from "Klinghoffer," featuring the title-role protagonist Sanford Sylvan
repeating his triumph. Baritone Sylvan soared with a voice that dripped
honeyed richness in nonpareil abundance; he sounds like this generation's
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but one with an unmistakable made-in-the-USA stamp,
once again signaling our American singers' coming of age.;    The pieces
offered a modern-day surrealism, whether in the soliloquy of the dying Leon
Klinghoffer during his slow-motion fall from the hijacked cruise ship, or the
strangely poetic "Bird Aria" of the Palestinian killer-terrorist Mamoud,
wistfully reflecting on the beauty of birds overhead.;    In both arias, Adams
laid out a spacious, comfortable vocal line for Sylvan's adagios with the
simplicity of a Purcell, committed to spotlighting the text's content rather
than any musical elaborations. Often the orchestra offered little more than
violin-dominated "halos" to encircle and embrace the voice, neatly rendered by
Adams himself on the podium. No hint of his earlier minimalism was evident.;  
 The conclusion is that Adams has again defied pigeonholing. He has entered
many styles with gusto, from chugging chordal repetition to modality to
near-Wagnerian romanticism to honky-tonk to a new post-minimalist
American-folk-like clarity. This versatility is a characteristic of a
tremendously inventive mind having many worlds yet left to conquer at the age
of 44, not all of them operatic.;    One non-operatic foray was his own
orchestration of Liszt's "La lugubre gondola" No. 2 ("The Black Gondola"),
which received its West Coast premiere Thursday. Writing late in life, Liszt
prophetically foresaw the death and funerary gondola trip of his son-in-law
Richard Wagner in Venice and wrote programmatic music to fit. Though there are
Wagnerian harmonies, and glints of themes recalling the chillingly haunting
Shepherd's Horn solo from "Tristan und Isolde," Liszt's treatment was almost
skeletal, whether in the piano version or in the alternate cello-piano version
played movingly beforehand by cellist Lee Duckles and pianist Emily
Wong-George.;    Adams transferred it, I think, too literally to orchestra,
with the string section taking most of the cello part, using almost no
harmonic filling out. The effect was too understated. Apart from Liszt
himself, no one short of Wagner should have carried out the orchestration. And
Wagner would have colored it so powerfully, so richly, that he'd have been
denounced as vehemently as Ted Turner is for his colorized movie classics.;   
The Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, looking like a near-clone of San Jose's, is a
Spartan half-century-old site better known for basketball than Beethoven and
Brahms. It lacks warmth on all fronts, but it offers capacity (900 seats for
this festival configuration), visibility and proximity. The most distant seat
sold is less than 80 feet from the podium, which is near center court on the
raised temporary stage.;    The auditorium sound for orchestra is pale and
distant. Future pressure will certainly come to amplify the orchestra as in
years past, despite all the (justified) kicking and screaming about sound
systems that have hardly proven state-of-the-art.;    The auditorium's big
plus is for chamber music, when the acoustic shell is drawn close to the
audience. The results then are downright gratifying, and no microphones need
to intrude.;    In addition, this 29th reprise of the fest born in Aptos is
offering pre-concert festivities out in the blocked-off street, with al fresco
dinners along with free local musical groups playing 75 minutes before curtain
time.;    There's even a booth selling numerous recordings made by Music
Director Dennis Russell Davies (who is on sabbatical), but so far none of the
many CDs of his internationally toasted 1991 fill-in, Adams.;    That should
change quickly if Adams' impressive opening concert is any guide.;    CABRILLO
