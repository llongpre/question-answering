<LEADPARA>  BILLY Harper is describing the night in 1966 when he walked into Slug's, the
jazz club in Manhattan's East Village in those days, and introduced himself to
the legendary drummer Elvin Jones: "I said, 'Mr. Jones, I'm Billy Harper from
Texas and I'd like to sit in with your band.' And he looked up at me and said,
'NO-O-O-O!';   "I didn't expect that," Harper says, laughing. Of course it
wasn't long before Harper, who brings his quintet to the Bay Area this weekend
and Santa Cruz on Monday, established himself as one of the most explosive,
sought-after tenor saxophonists in New York. But he was green then, in his
early 20s. Gaining the attention of Jones, who had left John Coltrane's band
not long before, took persistence.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "So the next night I went back," Harper continues, speaking from his
apartment in Manhattan, "and I sat down on the side and nothing happened. On
the third night, Elvin looked at me and said" -- now Harper imitates Jones'
raspy voice -- "'OK, OK, kid, you're gonna be all right. Just wait.' I sat
there in the corner, all night. And on the fourth night, I didn't say
anything. Elvin had Hank Mobley on tenor and I just sat in the corner until,
on the last number of the last set, he said, 'All right, come on!';   "And by
the time I jumped on the stage, Elvin jumped off! And Philly Joe Jones (an
equally legendary drummer) jumped up and sat down at the drums. And he was
going to put me through the test. So I started playing and all of a sudden
Philly Joe just stops! And I'm left there by myself to play, and play. And
finally Philly Joe comes back in and when it was over the crowd was smiling
and screaming and so everything was cool.";   The hard-to-find star;   That's
how Harper often leaves his audiences -- screaming. Players fall in and out of
fashion and right now the jazz musicians who get most of the press are either
puppies or senior citizens. Harper, 48, is from a generation that never really
got its due. He came up at a time when independent jazz labels were faltering
and rock music was turning into an industry, crowding out individual, creative
voices.;   But to musicians and the cognoscenti, Harper has been one of the
truly distinguished voices on the tenor sax for a quarter century. He wound up
joining Jones' band, spent a couple of years with Art Blakey and the Jazz
Messengers, and played beside the great, soulful trumpeter Lee Morgan. He was
a mainstay and soloist in the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis and Gil Evans big bands,
and spent eight years with the Max Roach Quartet before striking out full-time
on his own in the late '70s.;   Since then, he has recorded one hard-to-find
album after another -- the most recent is "Destiny is Yours," on Steeplechase
-- and become a celebrity in Japan. His quintet toured Malaysia, Indonesia and
the Philippines early this year and has just returned from a tour of Bulgaria
and Yugoslavia. "I do get employed," he jokes, "so I guess I'm famous
enough.";   Catching the Trane;   Harper is one of the few Coltrane disciples
with a unique voice. He plays with an intensity that's gone out of style --
soaring, emotive jazz that builds and builds as Harper chases his muse.
There's a Texas blues cry in his sound as well as the fervency of the church
-- his grandfather, who helped raise him, was a minister. All these influences
achieve a balance when Harper picks up his horn. His compositions are dramatic
and the music, at its best, achieves an almost unbearable beauty.;   For
Harper, it seems, playing the music has been its own reward. Told of rumors
that Branford Marsalis may front "The Tonight Show" house band for Jay Leno
next year, Harper says, "I admire some of the younger guys, like Branford, who
can get into the rock thing and get out again. But I don't think I'd ever take
that chance. I have this gift of music and my goal has always been to tell the
truth in artistry. Nobody ever told me, 'You're going to have this gift and
you're also going to make a lot of money.' I feel if I go for the money, I may
lose the gift -- the ability to create music.;   "When I am inspired, it seems
like a bolt of truth from above. It's like an opening up and a connecting with
a higher being. When that happens, and it doesn't happen all the time, the
truth is happening!" Harper says, laughing. "And based on people's reactions
to the music, people like the truth. Even in Bulgaria. But fame is not quite
my goal. It's the message in the music. If the message gets across, I don't
even have to worry about anything else. Fame? I'm not doing this for fame.";
