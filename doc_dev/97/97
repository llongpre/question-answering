<LEADPARA>  THOUGH regarded as a national model because it's the only one of its kind in
the United States, California's 14-year-old Arts-in-Corrections program really
hasn't been in place long enough for statistics to be meaningful.;    There
are high-profile success stories, to be sure, such as that of Manzanar Gamboa.
A Latino poet who found his voice in prison, Gamboa now works with 10,000
juvenile offenders each year through an outreach program run by LA
Theaterworks.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But for the most part, the numbers for recidivism rates and the
generalizations about prison morale tend to support the arts program's worth
without actually verifying it.;    A 1987 recidivism study noted that, six
months after parole, 88 percent of those who had participated in inmate arts
programs had not returned to prison, compared with a 72.5 percent rate of
non-return overall; and two years after release, 69 percent of those
introduced to the arts through the prison system had maintained a favorable
parole status, compared with 42 percent of total parolees.;    Moreover, a
1983 study points to an 80 percent reduction in disciplinary write-ups for
inmates who elect an arts outlet.;    "They have incredible amounts of energy,
and the lack of real avenues to express it is very often what has led to their
criminal behavior in the first place," says Jack Bowers, "artist-facilitator"
(i.e., program coordinator) at Soledad, where he has taught music since 1980.;
   Alluding ominously to "a greater chance of making a productive citizen out
of a probable repeat offender," the California Department of Corrections
admits grudgingly the "positive effect" of the arts-in-prisons program.;   
"This has occurred," says an exhibition catalog for a show of art by
prisoners, "because the inmates involved have acquired new attitudes about
themselves and their capabilities through their work in the arts. The mastery
of arts skills requires patience, self-discipline and a long-term commitment .
. ., attributes basic to an inmate's ability to function responsibly upon
release." What these percentages don't convey is the frustratingly small
number of inmates actually touched by the program.;    At Soledad, Bowers,
says 400 of 6,200 inmates have some hands-on contact with the
Arts-in-Corrections offerings. But after subtracting the quick-hit workshops
and the players in prison bands, there are perhaps 85 inmates in Soledad's
writing, art, music and theater instructional programs.;    Statewide, arts
programs touch about 3,000 inmates -- out of a prison population that topped
100,000 this year.;    It costs California taxpayers about $30,000 a year to
maintain each prisoner in the state correctional system, for an annual total
of $3 billion.;    Against the inhuman scale of this figure, it's no wonder
the California Arts Council debates every year whether the tiny amount of
money it invests in the inter-agency Arts-in-Corrections program is useful.;  
 According to CAC program officer Carol Shiffman, who oversees all the Artists
Serving Special Constituencies programs, $68,000 (25 percent of the Arts
Council's Artists-in-Residence budget) in 1990 went to prison arts programs: a
minuscule amount of an already inadequate budget to pay for art for the
elderly, disabled, homeless and mentally ill.;    But the view from the other
direction is persuasive. The William James Association of Santa Cruz, one of
two private agencies in the state that channel money and artists into the
correctional system, has a $400,000 contract this year with the Department of
Corrections and the Arts Council.;    "If 15 people don't go back to prison,"
said Ellen Davidson, executive director of this agency, "we've paid for
ourselves." Davidson's mother, Eloise Smith of Santa Cruz, was the guiding
spirit behind the Arts-in-Corrections program, which she initiated in 1977 as
director of the California Arts Council. From a three-year pilot project in
the state Correctional Medical Facility at Vacaville, the program has expanded
to 15 artists working in minimum- and medium-security facilities around the
state.;    Eight of these are funded under the joint CAC/CDC program, the rest
by the CDC alone. Under the joint program, the Arts Council pays $800 a month
to the artists, the CDC $500. "I can tell you, the CDC never pays on time,"
said Nigel Sanders-Self, who runs the theater program at Soledad.;    It's one
of the many ironies of working in a system that expects good results from its
arts programs but fears the openness that might guarantee those results.;   
"Art is about breaking rules," says Bowers, "and prison is about enforcing
rules."  </TEXT>
