  [Text] Podgorica, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic said today that the hopes that 
Montenegro, as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will 
be given somewhat different treatment as regards sanctions are 
unrealistic. The international community is not even 
considering a partial relaxation of sanctions against Montenegro 
alone, and such a solution "would not be good for either 
Montenegro or Serbia," he said. 
  Speaking about a possible lifting of the sanctions against 
Montenegro, which has been talked about increasingly often among 
the public, Djukanovic said at a news conference that the only 
relaxation that Montenegro could expect is the reestablishing of 
traffic links with Italy and somewhat more generous humanitarian 
aid, due to the large numbers of refugees. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister stressed that the awareness 
of 
how senseless the sanctions are is gaining strength in the 
international community, for it is being realized that they have 
not achieved their objective. Asked how much the sanctions have 
cost Montenegro, Djukanovic said that the "amount of the losses" 
cannot be precisely quantified. However, he added, the lost 
exports and revenue from tourism, the non-functioning of the 
merchant fleet, and the inability to meet contractual 
obligations to foreign partners have so far cost Montenegro some 
$3.34 billion. 
  Speaking about new economic measures, Djukanovic mentioned a 
possible increase in salaries in the republic, but warned they 
have to be kept in line with other parameters, particularly with 
production.
