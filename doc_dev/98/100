  [Text] Belgrade, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Seselj, 
president of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said today that 
the Srpska republic should totally reject yesterday's NATO 
ultimatum. At a news conference Seselj stressed that the 
radicals advocate negotiations and a truce with the Muslim side 
on a reciprocal basis but NATO should not interfere. 
  "If the Srpska republic and the Muslim Jamahiriyah 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] agree on a cease-fire and the withdrawal of 
heavy weaponry, such an agreement should be respected, but NATO 
has no right to interfere," the SRS leader says. He welcomed 
Radovan Karadzic's statement that everyone who talks to Serbs in 
the language of ultimatums should consider the Austro-Hungarian 
empire's experience. 
  Seselj said that the massacre in Sarajevo's marketplace was 
staged by the Muslim regime and that it evidently demonstrated 
that Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is a "religious fanatic" 
who does not think about human lives, as he wants to trigger 
foreign military intervention. 
  In the event of an attack on Serb positions in Bosnia, the 
SRS leader said, every Serb's patriotic duty will be to resist 
this aggression. "We would regard such an attack in the same 
way we would regard aggression against Serbia, Montenegro, and 
the Serb republic of Krajina; in such a case the SRS would rally 
all volunteers from the SRS and Serbian chetnik movement and 
dispatch them to the territory of the Srpska republic." He 
noted that in this event all interparty squabbling should be 
relegated to the background. 
  Asked about his personal view, Seselj said that in the event 
of an attack "one should pound all NATO's possible targets -- 
bases in Italy and other countries from which aircraft would be 
operating -- as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops." 
  "Air raids can achieve nothing. I believe this is how the 
Serbs will react, whereas we radicals will take part in this 
reaction," the SRS leader stressed.
