  [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin President 
Momir Bulatovic announced today that a Greek consulate would 
open in this Republic. 
  "In the course of a visit by Greek Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Karolos Papoulias some time ago we accepted with 
pleasure an offer by our guests to open a Greek consulate in 
Montenegro," Bulatovic said, adding that according to what he 
had learned, the Greek parliament has approved such a decision. 
  Replying to a question on the possibility of the opening of 
the consulates of other countries in Montenegro, Bulatovic said 
at a news conference that there was also interest in the opening 
of an Albanian consulate. Unfortunately, he added, "because of 
the current political situation, this idea has not yet reached 
the phase of realization." 
  The Montenegrin president stressed that the foreign policy 
orientation of the government and the leadership of this 
republic is "to accept offers and set up a consular network", 
which would also make the entire diplomatic communication of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more efficient.
