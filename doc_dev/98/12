  [Text] Podgorica, May 31 (TANJUG) -- It has been officially 
estimated that the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro has sustained 
a loss of over five billion dollars over the past two years of 
the international blockade. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic has said that this is the rough estimate of both 
direct and indirect losses caused by the sanctions. He added, 
however, that there were also losses which cannot be measured by 
statistical figures. 
  According to the federal government, the international 
blockade has over the past two years inflicted on the Yugoslav 
economy a direct loss of 35 billion dollars, which, together 
with those caused indirectly, amount to 100 billion dollars. On 
May 30, 1992, the U.N. Security Council introduced draconic 
economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) because of its alleged involvement in the 
civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most Montenegrin firms are operating at 
intervals and below their rated capacities. It is estimated 
that one-third of the total 130,000-strong workforce has been 
laid off with token pay due to the slashed production rate. 
  Montenegro's most vital and profitable industries, such as 
tourism, maritime economy, iron and steel industry and 
non-ferrous metal industry, have been severely crippled by the 
international blockade. Montenegro's fleet, which formerly 
accounted for about 20 per cent of the annual foreign currency 
revenues and for about five per cent of the total revenues, has 
found itself on the verge of collapse. The fleet's 37 ships, 
with 977,000-tonne cargo capacity, is blocked in harbours 
throughout the world, for which Yugoslavia has to pay a lay-over 
tax amounting to over 50 million dollars a year. 
  The sanctions have especially aggravated the humanitarian 
situation in the republic, as the impoverished economy bears the 
brunt of providing not only for its 615,000 citizens but also 
for more than 50,000 refugees in Montenegro. Over the past two 
years, Montenegro has on several occasions urged the U.N. 
Sanctions Committee to approve exports of alumina, which would 
enable the purchase of necessary foodstuffs and medicines, but 
none of the requests have so far been approved.
