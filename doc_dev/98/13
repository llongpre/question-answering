  [Text] "Take me east of Suez where there is no difference 
between the best and the worst," Rudyard Kipling wished once. 
This week it was not necessary to travel that far in order to 
reach a world in which fantasy and reality meet. The second DPS 
[Democratic Party of Socialists] congress was the place in which 
the desired and the twisted world in which we live, led by the 
DPS and its leaders, were equalized. 
  DPS members said in the congress that they were devoted to 
democracy, but at the same time they use wiretaps and physical 
threats and misuse the media, which are more brutal than the 
communist television during the last 50 years. They claim to be 
establishing a constitutional state and torture people in 
prisons. They make statements in which they point out that they 
pursue the politics of peace and friendly relations with their 
neighbors, but they have obviously forgotten that they led a war 
outside Montenegro and sowed 250 graves over the country for 
Montenegrin youngsters who died in that war. They pretend to be 
developing a civilized state, while supporting ethnic cleansing 
not only in Bosnia, but also in Boka Kotorska and in northern 
Montenegro. They support political pluralism and parliamentary 
democracy but they arm their political followers. They boast 
about the safety Montenegro citizens allegedly have, but they 
"forget" to mention the act of kidnapping in Strpci, in which 
they were involved. They are trying to convince us that their 
foreign policy is constructive and assessed positively by the 
whole world, but their plane can only fly to Greece in order to 
buy furniture for their new apartments there. They are open to 
all democratic ideas, but "their attitudes are completely 
identical" with those of the fascist Zhirinovsky. They 
conducted a "secret" poll about public matters and invited the 
manager of an "independent" institute of an "autonomous" 
university to the party congress in order to read what they 
wrote for him. Their bells [the state media] were ringing two 
days long telling us that according to that objective poll more 
than 70 percent of the 1,000 respondents support Yugoslavia, but 
they did not say that less than 5 percent supported an alliance 
of Serbian states, called Yugoslavia, into which they want to 
push Montenegro, too. 
  Momir Bulatovic and Milo Djukanovic revived the idea that 
Montenegro and Herzegovina should merge. They did not state the 
reasons, so we cannot think of their opposite in order to know 
what their real motives are, but let us mention two possible 
reasons in order to make things clearer. One of the reasons is 
to offer the greedy and disoriented Montenegrins the chance to 
spread to Herzegovina. In this way they would be silenced -- 
they would not dare oppose the process of making Montenegro a 
Serbian province. They would perhaps not become a national 
minority, but a weak majority in their own state. The second 
reason reveals that the constructors of a greater-Serbia in 
Bosnia have difficulties. If the Muslim-Croatian federation is 
accomplished, there are good chances that the territories along 
the Drina River in Eastern Bosnia will be annexed to it, 
regardless of the fact that they are ethnically clean now. If 
Serbs oppose the tripartite federation and if Bosnia enters two 
confederations, with Croatia and Serbia, there is the 
possibility that Serbian territories in Bosnia be divided into 
two separate parts. In this case, Herzegovina would be 
connected with Serbia through Montenegro as a member state of 
the alliance of Serbian states. 
  The DPS, led by Bulatovic and Djukanovic, keeps on denying 
Montenegro as a state. In the alliance of Serbian states, 
although its name might be Yugoslavia, there is no place for 
Montenegrin individuality, there are no conditions to cherish 
the national, cultural, religious, and other authentic 
Montenegrin traditions. The Serbian Institute for the 
Protection of Monuments was given the task of renovating the 
Romanesque church of Sveti Luka in Kotor. After the renovation 
the original dome without a square pedestal was turned into the 
Raska School type dome with a high square pedestal. This example 
illustrates how dull the (post)communist Montenegro is. It also 
shows the Serbian attitude toward Montenegrin cultural heritage 
and its future in any union of Serbian states. 
  The DPS members who gave standing ovations to the university 
assistant from Podgorica, should know that they are participants 
in the crime being committed against Montenegro on their behalf 
and with their own hands. 
  The fact that this is interpreted as the people's wish does 
not change the essence.
