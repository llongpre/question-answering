<F P=106> [Article by M. Vico: "How To Salvage the Fleet"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Montenegro Prime Minister Mile Djukanovic, 
opening a two-day conference on the prospects of the 
shipbuilding, repair, and servicing industry in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] organized by the Veljko Vlahovic 
Shipyard in Bijela, Montenegro, within the framework of this 
year's Mimosa Festival, spoke on the resources available to the 
Montenegrin maritime trade sector and on government measures to 
safeguard that industry under the conditions of sanctions. 
  Djukanovic said: "The following data speak about the 
significance and the prospects of the maritime trade industry of 
Montenegro: a port cargo handling capacity of about five million 
tons, a repair capacity of 80 to 100 ships annually, a fleet 
consisting of 37 ships with about one million tons displacement, 
5,200 workers -- 5 percent of the total number of employed in 
the republic. Participation in maritime trade accounts for 17 
percent of the GNP of the republic and 20 percent of total 
foreign exchange income. 
  Projects planned for the development of maritime trade were 
halted with the introduction of sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. Sanctions did not affect any other sector of the 
economy to such a degree as they did maritime trade. They 
brought into question its very survival. Direct damage from the 
sanctions to the maritime trade enterprises of Montenegro has 
been assessed at $220 million. The republic government, together 
with the federal government, is undertaking measures to 
safeguard existing capacities during the sanctions, i.e., to 
activate them as successfully as possible after the sanctions 
are lifted. [passage omitted] 
  This is why, with the help of the federal government and the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia, $45 million have been earmarked for 
that purpose. These funds have saved the ships from 
foreclosure." [passage omitted]
