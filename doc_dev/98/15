  [Text] (From our correspondent) Podgorica, 28 January -- 
According to an article published in the Novi Pazar magazine 
SANDZAK, Montenegrin and Albanian authorities concluded a secret 
agreement on the export of gasoline from Albania to Montenegro, 
from where it is delivered to Pale [capital of the Srpska 
republic] to be used by the Bosnian Serb military. 
  According to the article, Montenegrin Albanians living along 
the Montenegrin-Albanian border are involved in the deals. Some 
of them have been licensed by the Montenegrin Government to 
"import" gasoline. Gasoline, which costs one German mark per 
liter in the Albanian town of Scutari, is transported in large 
quantities across Lake Skutari to Montenegro. The Yugoslav Army 
provides specially equipped boats. 
  The citizens of Montenegro involved in this business earn 
one-half mark per liter. Almost all local residents participate 
in this trade (actually it is a state-sanctioned smuggling 
operation) because of the high earnings. Montenegro and the 
Srpska republic are well supplied with gasoline. The Pizon 
Petrol Enterprise, owned by the former Crvena Zvezda soccer 
player Vladimir Petrovic Pizon, transports gasoline from Lake 
Scutari to Pale. 
  As reported, the Albanian authorities have recently 
tightened 
control over gasoline sales in Scutari, but it is a well-known 
secret that gasoline stations in Scutari work at full speed and 
sell almost half of all the gasoline sold in Albania. We are 
talking about very large quantities, knowing that last year 
Albanians registered several thousand vehicles that they had 
purchased at European junkyards. According to the article, Pale 
receives five to seven tanker-truck loads of Albanian gasoline 
each day. 
  In addition to Albania, Macedonia is also accused of 
sanctions violations. At the border crossings near Ohrid and 
Rozaj (on the Macedonian-Albanian and Montenegrin-Albanian 
borders), aluminum is exported from Montenegro and raw materials 
are imported for Montenegro and Serbia without hindrance. Heavy 
trucks and trailers wait for hours on both sides of the border 
crossings, which in the past were almost without traffic. 
  If all this is true, we could conclude that this type of 
border trade, uncontrolled by representatives of the 
international community, was agreed to by Momir Bulatovic and 
Sali Berisha when the Montenegrin president visited Tirana. At 
the same time, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic paid a 
visit to Skopje. It is a fact that we can only guess now how 
Albania benefits. Maybe it is alleviation of discontent in the 
western part of the country, where at least some hundred local 
residents are earning good incomes trafficking in gasoline.
