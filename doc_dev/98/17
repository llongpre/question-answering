  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, March 6 (TANJUG) -- 
Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists ended its 
second congress in the capital Podgorica late on Sunday. 
  The congress re-elected Montenegrin President Momir 
Bulatovic 
as president of the party. Closing the two-day gathering of 218 
delegates, Bulatovic emphasised the importance of cherishing and 
promoting the state of Montenegro which, together with Serbia, 
forms Yugoslavia, and said that nobody had the right to break 
these states. It is not in Montenegro's interest to form a 
state only with Serbia, "our vital interests lie also in the 
direction of Herzegovina, and we have close historical and 
economic ties also with the Bosnian Serb republic and the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)" said Bulatovic. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in 
those 
parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia 
where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their 
rights. 
  In 1992, local Serbs in the breakaway Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, formed their Bosnian Serb republic in 
their ancestral ethnic lands. 
  Bulatovic said that Montenegro was supporting and would 
continue to do so the struggle of the Serb people outside 
Yugoslavia for freedom, dignity and equality, but added that it 
would continue to oppose "the extreme nationalism which has 
grown root under the influence of civil war, radically 
confronted ideologies and narrow national interests." 
  He stressed that Moslems in Montenegro must by no means be 
equated with the militant fundamentalists in the Bosnian Moslem 
leadership, and that the Albanians who advocate secessionism and 
violent methods of its achievement were few in the republic. 
  Bulatovic said that there must be no animosity towards 
Croats 
in Montenegro, because "we have never waged war on the Croatian 
people, but on the proponents of the extremist greater-national 
ideology" in Croatia. 
  He said that Montenegro had been the first to "suggest to a 
wondering Europe the idea of a normalisation of relations among 
the former Yugoslav republics," and that Montenegro "has no 
reason for a confrontation with, for instance, Macedonia or 
Slovenia."
