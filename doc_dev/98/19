  [Excerpt] Podgorica, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--We hope that the 
Yugoslav crisis is reaching its final stage, the stage of an 
antiwar and political outcome, Montenegrin Foreign Affairs 
Minister Miodrag Lekic told POBJEDA today. 
  He added that it would be logical to expect--following the 
agreement on the federal and confederal links between the 
Muslims and Croats that enables the Croats in Bosnia to have 
state and institutional links with their mother 
country--something similar to be offered to the Serbs also so 
that they can link up with their natural homeland, Serbia. By 
taking such an approach, the international community, while in a 
way restoring Yugoslavia--that is, linking parts of that 
formerly complex country--wants to prevent the creation of an 
Islamic fundamentalist Bosnia and to secure natural links 
between identical peoples. 
  Asked whether Montenegro's Ministry for Foreign Affairs will 
be disbanded, Lekic categorically said that the ministry was 
working as usual and that the termination of its work and 
existence was totally out of the question. [passage omitted]
