  [Text] Podgorica, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- Significant headway 
has been achieved in the talks conducted by the Montenegrin 
delegation in Great Britain, because there is a growing 
awareness that the policy of sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and Montenegro is pointless, Montenegrin 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said in his assessment of the 
Montenegrin delegation's visit to Great Britain. The delegation 
returned to Podgorica yesterday evening. 
  The stands of the international community -- primarily the 
European Union -- on the futility of the policy of sanctions, 
which have, in a way, been conveyed to the Montenegrin 
delegation will, according to Djukanovic, encourage a flurry of 
activity leading to the establishment of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, after which the sanctions against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be alleviated. 
  Assessing the talks in Great Britain as extremely useful and 
interesting, the Montenegrin prime minister stressed that it had 
been mutually noted that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of 
paramount importance, and that this will be followed by all 
other moves on the part of the international community. 
  Respect was also voiced toward the principled policies 
pursued by Montenegro, both in the sense of searching for a 
solution in the region of former Yugoslavia and of normalizing 
the situation in the entire area, Djukanovic said. He attaches 
great importance to the fact that, by making this visit, 
Montenegro's foreign policy, which does carry a certain amount 
of weight in the eyes of the international community, has 
announced the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive.
