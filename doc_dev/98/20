  [Text] London, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd today received a Montenegrin delegation headed by 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
  The Montenegrin delegation was received this afternoon by 
Douglas Hogg, state minister at the Foreign Office, and visited 
the British Council. 
  The Montenegrin delegation also includes Deputy Prime 
Minister Kruno Vukcevic and Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic. 
  It has been learned from the delegation that the talks 
centred on the crisis in former Yugoslavia, especially the 
search for a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Hezcegovina. The hosts 
asked the Montenegrin delegation to convey their appeal to the 
Yugoslav side to help in the establishment of peace in Bosnia by 
influencing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed 51:49 
territorial ratio. 
  According to Milo Djukanovic, Montenegro will do all it can 
to find a peaceful solution as soon as possible. 
  The hosts were also informed about the consequences of the 
international sanctions on the Montenegrin economy, and the 
government delegation requested Britain's aid in opening a ferry 
line to Italy for humanitarian reasons, and to enable the 
blocked Montenegrin ships to return to their home ports. 
  The Montenegrin delegation will be meeting members of the 
British-Yugoslav group in the British Parliament tomorrow.
