  [Text] Podgorica -- It is certain that the international 
sanctions will remain in effect for some time. Therefore, the 
healthy part of the economy that can produce and sell its 
products must be stimulated. The new economic program for the 
revival of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been drafted 
by a team of experts and it would be good if the federal 
government shared the responsibility for the program's 
implementation. This was stated by Vojin Djukanovic, president 
of Economic Chamber of Montenegro at a meeting with businessmen 
and trade union leaders in Podgorica yesterday. 
  However, the majority of businessmen drew attention to a 
number of unknowns contained in the program. Slobodan Lekovic 
took the view that the elaborate program did not take into 
account the interests of Montenegro, above all, those in the 
maritime economy, tourism, and transportation infrastructure. 
"Relations between the two federal units -- Serbia and 
Montenegro -- in their joint state of Yugoslavia have not been 
presented fully and clearly," Lekovic said. 
  Dr. Janko Radulovic expressed the view that reaching a 
political consensus is a very important factor for the 
realization of the program. He stressed that the program must 
be accompanied by a number of operational and legal regulations, 
adding: "The program is more turned toward the Republic of 
Serbia and if it has any pretensions toward the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, it must respect the specific characteristics of 
the Montenegrin economy more." 
  Danilo Popovic, head of the Montenegrin Confederation of 
Trade Unions, said that it was not questionable that we needed a 
program to solve the crisis, but expressed the doubt: "Who will 
pay for it if it fails. A large number of workers, pensioners, 
and disabled people, according to statistics, are paupers, 
because they are surviving on about 10 German marks a month when 
it is known that the minimum amount of money needed to survive, 
according to international standards, is about 30 German marks a 
month. Trade unions will demand wages to be paid in a stable, 
convertible currency, or the new dinar, or in kind." Popovic 
said that the Confederation of Trade Unions would today 
officially inform the public about its objections to the 
program. This will also be done by the Economic Chamber of 
Montenegro in its assessment that will be sent to the federal 
government today.
