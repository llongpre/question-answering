<F P=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "Montenegro Is Not a Serbian </F>
State"] 
  [Text] Pristina -- "It is obvious that I cannot have a 
favorable opinion about any proposal that turns Montenegro into 
a region. This means that the proposal, which comes from 
Belgrade, that would lead to Montenegro losing its statehood is 
unacceptable to us. The authors of such ideas and projects are 
mistaken, since Montenegrin statehood has been forged by the 
nation through burdensome history, and that is why the current 
Montenegrin generation has the moral duty to take a dignified 
patriotic stand toward such tendencies that are aimed at 
obstructing the revival of Montenegrin statehood. I regard as 
frivolous all the theories about a new constitution based on 
regionalization." 
  This is what Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic said 
in an extensive interview for the Pristina ZERI. 
  Asked about the possibility of creating a union of Serbian 
states, which would also include Montenegro, Lekic said: 
  "We are discussing ideas, thoughts. However, they not only 
have not been discussed and verified at the official state 
levels, but they have not even been defined. In any case, in 
connection with our position, that is, the Montenegro's 
position, there are many open questions. As for an association, 
that is links between the Serb Krajina and the republic of 
Srpska, I can see some difficulties in Montenegro participating 
in such a creation. To start with, Montenegro is not a Serbian 
state, but a state of the people who live in it, that is, a 
civil state." 
  The Montenegrin foreign minister said that there were "no 
secret connections between Montenegro and Italy," and he also 
said that relations with Albania were better since "whenever I 
travel abroad, I fly from the Tirana airport." As for Kosovo, 
he said: "The basic thing is to start a serious dialogue, but 
it is hard to say what kinds of solutions will be found. In any 
case, it would be best if the solutions were to reflect the will 
of all the citizens. I support certain rights for Kosovo, 
autonomy, certain subjectivity."
