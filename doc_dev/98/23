  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- The region of Ulcinj, 
with eighty per cent Albanians, is now an objective of the 
Serbian headquarters. According to a report in newspaper 
RILINDJA on January 5, the Valdanos Bay, known for its beauty 
and riches along the Adriatic Sea, will be transformed in a 
military base. 
  In a recent press conference, the commander of the Serbian 
and Montenegrin military-naval forces, Mr. Dojcilo Isakovic, 
cited by the pro-government Montenegrin newspaper POBJEDA spoke 
about creation of a naval base in the bay of Valdanos, near 
Ulcinj, which will cover an area of 340 hectares. 
  Reacting against the military plans of Belgrade, the 
secretary of the party of the Liberal League of Montenegro, Mr. 
Miodrag Burzan, stressed that during the time of the former 
Yugoslavia, Montenegro possessed 1/10 of the seashore. Now, 
seventy-eighty per cent of the naval forces is concentrated in 
this place. This movement of the naval forces in the seashore of 
Montenegro threatens in transforming this republic in a military 
base, stressed Burzan, adding that such projects, which are 
being planned even for the regions around the lake of Shkoder, 
aim at transforming Montenegro in a concentrated military camp.
