  [Text] Tirana, June 14 (ATA) -- A delegation of the 
Republic of Montenegro arrived in Tirana on its way to the UK. 
The delegation is led by Premier Milo Djukanovic and composed 
of Deputy Premier Krunoslav Vukcevic and Foreign Minister 
Miodrag Lekic. 
  On the request of the Montenegrin part, the delegation was 
received in Durres by Premier Aleksander Meksi and Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi. Mr. Meksi pointed out the contacts and 
dialogue are important for the development of the relations 
between the two countries. This is a principle of the Albanian 
foreign policy also applied in the relations between Albania and 
Montenegro. The Albanian Government, said Mr. Meksi, holds that 
both sides should find possibilities for a cooperation in the 
future in fields of mutual interest. He also mentioned aspects 
of the regional situation, reiterating Albania's opinion on the 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the issue of the Albanians in 
Kosova and the relations of Albania with neighbouring countries. 
  Mr. Djukanovic, Montenegrin premier, pointed out the 
readiness for cooperation between Montenegro and Albania, as 
neighbouring countries with common interests. He also spoke 
about the Balkan situation, laying the stress in the development 
of the dialogue between the two parties.
