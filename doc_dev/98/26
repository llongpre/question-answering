  [Text] Regarding the power industry, Montenegro has 
demanded that the joint state function on the federal principle 
-- that is, that Yugoslav oil and petroleum products be divided 
between both republics according to their needs and not just 
given to one republic. Yugoslav oil practically belongs to just 
Serbia, as it is produced only in Serbia -- Vojvodina -- so all 
products have previously ended up exclusively in Serbia. As the 
production in Serbia (in addition to stealing Croatian oil from 
Djeletovci) is considered Yugoslav in the federal balance of 
energy supply and consumption, the Montenegrins hold that this 
Yugoslav production must be divided as such. 
  "Montenegro did not get a single drop of oil or any other 
energy product from the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption, so the Government of Montenegro has reiterated the 
demand for solving the problem, which was presented to the 
Federal Executive Council a long time ago," said Montenegrin 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Miodrag Gomilanovic, 
Montenegrin minister of power industry, says that the situation 
regarding oil and petroleum products threatens to block the 
economy and lives since all reserves on all levels have been 
exhausted. He added: "We demand joint criteria for the 
distribution of oil -- that is, a priority list. The so-called 
first priority group should have the same criteria for consumers 
in Serbia and Montenegro." 
<H5>  Petrol Stations Instead of Pillboxes </H5>
  It is obvious that the federal Yugoslav balance of energy 
supply and consumption exists only on paper and is applied 
solely to priority consumers in Serbia following the old saying: 
"Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin." In other words, all 
petroleum products in "the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]" 
are produced by the "Serbian Oil Industry of Nis" and it is all 
distributed to priority consumers, except for some symbolic 
amounts for free sale, by the republic (Serbian) emergency 
committee. The so-called federal committee is only informed 
about the amount that is to be divided by the Serbian republic 
committee. Montenegro, therefore, requested (demanded) the 
right to buy a certain percentage of total production on the 
basis of former consumption ratio. 
  And while "the shirt and the skin" are not being treated as 
equal, Kotor "Jugopetrol" published the information according to 
which three metric tons of gasoline and eight tons of diesel are 
being delivered to the Montenegrin market daily, so that the 
present monthly balance of Montenegro amounts to approximately 
100 tons of gasoline and 250 tons of diesel. However, priority 
consumers need about 300 tons of gasoline and 1,800 tons of 
diesel. 
  The amount needed is acquired on the black market under the 
auspices of the state. For example, it is an open secret that, 
at the Bozaj border crossing toward Albania, Montenegrin customs 
officers charge one dinar per liter of gasoline to truck drivers 
whose trucks have additional, so-called expanded fuel tanks. 
Indeed, it is only done a couple of days each month, while 
"expanded fuel tanks" are usually tolerated the rest of the 
month. Otherwise, oil and gasoline are most often transported 
illegally by water, especially across Lake Skadar, which forms 
most of the borderline between Montenegro and Albania. Oil 
fever has spread to villages on both sides of the lake. In "the 
land of eagles," gas stations are being built along the borders, 
replacing the string of pillboxes. Researching those oil roads, 
correspondents of the Montenegrin independent weekly MONITOR 
found out that about 200 boats cross the imaginary borderline 
between Montenegro and Albania every day. The boats are used 
for smuggling everything from cigarettes to satellite dishes, 
but mostly for oil and gasoline. The profitability of the 
entire operation is substantiated by the following data: The 
Albanians are paid 0.7 German marks [DM] per liter of oil, which 
is later sold for DM1.2 -- the equivalent amount in Avramovic's 
dinars. Consequently, the profit is about half a German mark 
per liter, but since the state takes 70 percent of that, 
black-marketeers are left with about DM30 (dinars) per barrel. 
(It has become customary in these transactions to use standard 
"Skadar barrels," which contain 210 liters each.) In this case, 
a recently founded firm "Transport" of Podgorica presents a kind 
of authority, according to MONITOR, as it issues permits for 
black-marketing on behalf of the Government of Montenegro. Just 
as every other official document, that permit has serial number, 
name, surname, and photograph of the person to which it is 
issued. Black-marketeers point out that, on the arrival to the 
Montenegrin side of the lake, they can only deliver oil to 
certain authorized persons, otherwise the permit "is gone." The 
permit means so much, among other reasons, because its holders 
enjoy the protection of both the police and the army. 
  The busiest spot on the Montenegrin side of Lake Skadar is 
at the "Plavnica" motel. The former favorite weekend resort of 
Podgorica inhabitants, which, in the past couple of years, has 
been more frequently closed than open, has taken on a new life 
thanks to oil. The motel was leased for DM1,200 per month. The 
lessee rigged up a wharf and every cistern's approach to the 
so-called loading pad is charged DM200. Motel "Plavnica" also 
has an entertainment program featuring Russian strippers. As 
many as 10 cisterns with Serb and Bosnian license plates are 
filled up here every day. Some of them belong to a Belgrade 
firm "Pizon," whose owner is famous former soccer player for 
"Zvezda" [Belgrade soccer team] Vladimir Petrovic Pizon. Oil is 
being smuggled on the Bojana River, which connects Lake Skadar 
with the sea, as well as in Ulcinj, by means of a specially 
designed raft cistern that is towed by boat along the sea border 
between Montenegro and Albania. 
<H5>  Plastic Tube at the Bottom of the Bojana </H5>
  However, the oil warehouse at Plavnica has recently burned 
down. Some five acres of land was burned then, two cisterns, 
several hundred tons of oil, a dozen cars, and two tractors were 
destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Soon after 
that, the Albanian police, in collaboration with the World 
Organization of Customs Officers, discovered a plastic tube at 
the bottom of the Bojana River that was used to carry oil from 
Albania to Montenegro. The Ulcinj connection was also 
"unearthed." All those events, just as the recent confiscation 
of a tanker transporting oil for Montenegro, which was 
redirected to Brindisi by NATO and Western European Union 
forces, indicate that the "Skadar connection" is slowly running 
dry. Among others, the Albanian police have also been 
instructed by the international community and organizations that 
supervise the embargo imposed on "the FRY" to cover the entire 
area of Skadar and prevent further black-marketing of oil. It 
is an open secret that Montenegrin and Albanian black-marketeers 
have easily found a common ground in the business, and we must 
point out that every black-marketeer caught on the Albanian side 
had to pay a fine of DM10. 
  Those relations were soon strained as a result of the 
mentioned haggling over the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption between Serbia and Montenegro, and there is no doubt 
that Montenegro will be getting the worst of it for a while. 
And so, the Belgrade economic circles will again start working 
on "dividing Yugoslav petroleum products from Serbia," but 
according to the already known principle. In other words, 
Montenegro should offer a certain amount of money to be used for 
research and production "of the very Yugoslav oil in Vojvodina." 
The thesis says that at least one part of the Montenegrin 
tourist pie will have to end up in the oil fields of Vojvodina, 
for it is senseless to demand federal rights without accepting 
federal obligations. Alleged equal status of Montenegro in the 
joint federal state is, therefore, still an ideal and the cry of 
Milo Djukanovic, one of the architects of "Zabljak Yugoslavia," 
[the meeting in Zabljak was held to confirm the preservation of 
Yugoslavia] does indeed seem grotesque. Oil problems are just 
the tip of the iceberg of the "joint" economy. The Serbian idea 
of a joint market is described by the case of importing 50,000 
tons of salt for the needs of Serbia. Meanwhile, there are more 
than 35,000 of tons of salt at the Ulcinj salt-works, so the 
amount of unsold salt threatens to have serious repercussions on 
the harvest this year.... In a nutshell, Montenegro is 
suffocating more and more every day.
