  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, Feb 2 (TANJUG) -- Italian 
Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta says that Italy has 
acquiesced in Montenegro's request to intercede with the U.N. 
Sanctions committee for stepping up the procedure for issuing 
permits for aid deliveries to that Yugoslav Republic. In a 
letter to his Montenegrin counterpart Miodrag Lekic, Andreatta 
said Italy had upheld also Montenegro's request for permission 
to export aluminium and use the proceeds for humanitarian 
imports. Andreatta said that Italy was already investing 
efforts for the reopening of the ferry line between Bari, Italy, 
and Bar, Montenegro, being aware of its importance to Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) and its communications with the rest of the 
world. 
  Although humanitarian goods are supposed to be exempt from 
sanctions clamped on Yugoslavia by the United Nations in May of 
1992 for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. sanctions committee has often been 
deliberately slow in issuing the necessary permits for the 
import of even the most essential articles, which are in 
extremely short supply because of the embargo, making life 
difficult both for the Yugoslavs and the 700,000 refugees 
accommodated in the country.
