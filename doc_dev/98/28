    [Editorial Report] South Slav media have been carrying 
reports that the Yugoslav military leadership has become 
increasingly worried about troop morale. Fewer and fewer 
soldiers are going to war voluntarily, and the authorities in 
Serbia and Montenegro have had to resort to forceful 
mobilization of Serb refugees. Commenting on this issue in a 3 
February interview on Sarajevo radio, Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic said that the Yugoslav military may be suffering a 
"shortage of manpower" and having problems with "the morale of 
that manpower." 
  In the 17 March issue of the Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK, the 
Slovene Press Agency [STA] reports that few conscripts are 
responding to call-ups in Montenegro. Many of them obtain 
medical certificates attesting that they are physically 
incapable of serving in the armed forces. Quoting the Podgorica 
weekly LIBERAL, STA states that such false medical certificates 
are sold by draft officers at a high price, adding that many 
reservists prefer going to jail to enlisting for the "defense of 
the fatherland." According to the report, the military police 
are quite active, picking up draftees on the streets and 
delivering them to military barracks. 
  STA reports that the "action" is supposedly coordinated by 
Major Veselin Sljivancanin, a "man on the wanted list" and the 
"hero of Vukovar." As commander of the 5th Motorized Brigade of 
the Podgorica Corps, he is also in charge of all Montenegrin 
draft boards. According to "well-informed sources," he was sent 
from Belgrade to Montenegro to "put military affairs in order 
and raise the morale of the military." "Other sources" claim 
that his assignment is to prevent the possible secession of 
Montenegro from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, if necessary 
by utilizing the "methods he employed in Vukovar." Examining his 
role in Montenegro, the 5 November issue of the Podgorica 
opposition weekly MONITOR concludes that Sljivancanin, "a lover 
of the Socialist Party of Serbia" and a proven fighter for the 
"Serbian cause," had been sent to exert "federal" pressure on 
the Montenegrin Government. Although he was allegedly received 
"cooly" by his immediate superior, General Milorad Obradovic, 
MONITOR reports, many people feel that Sljivancanin might remain 
in Podgorica permanently, while others believe that his 
assignment must be viewed as a "temporary solution" within the 
context of personnel changes in the Yugoslav Army.
