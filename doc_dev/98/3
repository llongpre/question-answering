  [Text] Podgorica, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Government of 
Montenegro has no official reports on or evidence of the 
mobilization of refugees, TANJUG was told today by Rade Perovic, 
deputy prime minister in the Montenegrin Government. The 
parliamentary Social-Democratic Party of Montenegro was the 
first to voice its opinion in reaction to reports on the alleged 
mobilization of refugees claiming that "with the blessing from 
the republic's bodies and the support of military authorities, 
refugees from the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina are issued 
call-ups to be mobilized into the army of the republic of 
Srpska." 
  The issue was also raised at a session of the Montenegrin 
parliament, held last week, when deputy Savo Jablan asked: "Who 
is behind the forced mobilization of refugees in Montenegro, and 
what is its aim?". Stressing that the government of Montenegro 
has no official reports on the alleged mobilization, Perovic, in 
charge of that ministry, claims that the UN convention on the 
status of refugees is honored in Montenegro. 
  "A decree on the care for refugees, passed in July 1992, 
regulates their position and status, and they are exempt from 
mobilization," Perovic stressed.
