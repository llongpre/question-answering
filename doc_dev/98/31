Montenegrins"] 
  [Text] Podgorica -- "Where are those who threatened me not 
to come to Montenegro?" Dr. Vojislav Seselj asked the members of 
the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and its sympathizers, who 
gathered to hail their leader on Saturday evening. To support 
his claim that there are no obstacles for him in "Serbian 
Montenegro," the leader of the Serbian Radicals quoted his visit 
to Plav, which is mainly inhabited by Muslims. "I strolled 
through Plav yesterday, and nobody dared utter a word," boasted 
Seselj who was received in the Budo Tomovic youth hall in 
Podgorica with chants Serbia! Serbia! and well-known Chetnik 
songs (Who is the second, I am the first to drink Turkish blood). 
  Seselj spoke mostly about the progress that has been made in 
the creation of a greater Serbia, calling on the Muslims and the 
Croats in the Republic of Croatia to "accept the peace on the 
front lines as this is the most fair. If they do not want this, 
the Serbs will conquer even those territories that they lost 
because of the betrayal by the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army." 
For this reason, the Serbs have lost Dubrovnik, Zadar, Sibenik, 
Karlovac, Virovitica, and Osijek ("all Serbian towns"), however, 
"one must be realistic" now and form a unified Serbian state 
with one parliament and one president on the territories that 
the Serbs "have managed to liberate." 
  "The SRS is a sword hanging over the heads of enemies of the 
Serbs," Seselj stated and added that "the Muslims in Sandzak are 
preparing for an uprising," however "let them, as several tens 
of thousands of SRS members and the Serbian Chetnik movement 
members are ready to go to these territories at any moment to 
prevent the fragmentation of the Serbian lands." The revenge 
will be bloody and there will be no mercy, Seselj added. 
  Dr. Seselj also reviewed the efforts of individual 
Montenegrin parties (the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and the 
Social Democratic Party) to separate Montenegro from the Serbian 
lands, which he described as "the betrayal of Serbianhood by 
foreign mercenaries," who would not have entered the Assembly 
had the Albanians, the Muslims and the Catholics in Boka 
Kotorska not voted for them.
