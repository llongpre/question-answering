    [Editorial Report] Three articles in two recent issues of 
the Belgrade weekly VREME discuss the public admission by Nikola 
Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of internal affairs, that Serb 
and Muslim refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina had been deported 
from Montenegro to Serbian-held territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  VREME's 4 April issue published a letter dated 18 September 
1992 written by Pejakovic in response to an inquiry by Daniela 
Stupar-Titoric, a Bosnia- Herzegovina refugee in Montenegro, 
about the fate of her husband. In the letter Pejakovic admitted 
to Stupar-Titoric that her husband, Alemko Titoric, from Novo 
Sarajevo, had been arrested in Herceg Novi, Montenegro, on 26 
May 1992 together with 34 other persons, and, at the request of 
the republic of Srpska [RS], the self-proclaimed Serb state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, handed over to Srebrenica Secretariat of 
Internal Affairs [SUP] officials, who in turn handed the 
refugees over to Bosnian Muslim military police at the 
Territorial Defense headquarters in Bratunac in exchange for RS 
prisoners. Pejakovic stated in the letter that he had no other 
information on the fate of the deported individuals. 
  The 11 April issue of VREME contended that Pejakovic's 
letter 
finally confirmed the suspicions of the Montenegrin opposition 
that what is at issue are "acts that have the character of war 
crimes against a civilian population." The weekly noted that 
opposition delegates in the Montenegrin Assembly had been 
demanding an investigation of the deportation of refugees since 
the "first half of 1992." These demands contributed to the 
"satanization" of the opposition in the Montenegrin press, VREME 
said, adding that the press viewed the arrested individuals as 
"Alija's fighters and perpetrators of diversionary tactics" who 
"came to Montenegro disguised as refugees" intending to "provoke 
a war in this area." In talks with opposition party delegations, 
however, Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic gave his 
assurance that the deportation of refugees would cease and that 
each case would be investigated, VREME reported, adding that a 
parliamentary commission had been formed to conduct an 
investigation. VREME listed the names of 85 ethnic Muslim and 
Serb deportees who it said were identified by Pejakovic in his 
April 1993 official response to the parliamentary commission. 
According to the information provided by Pejakovic, groups of 
refugees were turned over to the republic of Srpska on 19, 24, 
25, and 27 May 1992. 
  The same issue of VREME criticized the deportation of 
refugees and cited a statement by Nebojsa Vucinic, professor at 
the law faculty of the university in Podgorica, that "what is at 
issue is the violation of the Convention on the Status of 
Refugees, which Yugoslavia signed and ratified.... The basic 
right of refugees is that they not be returned to the state from 
which they escaped and in which their lives are in danger.... 
The basic duty of a state is to offer protection to the 
refugees, and if someone among them has committed a war crime or 
a crime against humanity, he is to answer before a regular court 
and through regular court proceedings." 
  VREME also quoted Stevan Lilic, professor of constitutional 
law at Belgrade University, who viewed Pejakovic's letter to 
Daniela Stupar-Titoric as "proof of the clinical death of a 
legal state." Lilic stated that the police violated both the 
Constitution of Montenegro and the Constitution and Criminal 
Code of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. He cited 
Article 23 of the FRY Constitution, which maintains that no one 
should be deprived of freedom except persons who have committed 
criminal acts; Article 154 of the Criminal Code of Yugoslavia, 
which calls for a five-year prison sentence for persons who 
violate human rights on the basis of ethnic, racial, or other 
differences; and Article 142 of the Code, according to which the 
taking of hostages is considered a war crime. Lilic asked: "Is 
the Montenegrin Ministry of Internal Affairs in the service of 
the republic of Srpska, and is Montenegro conducting on its 
territory a manhunt for people of another state and on behalf of 
that state? Thus, a state is violating its own constitution in 
order to do a service for another state.... This act is not only 
unconstitutional, it is totally immoral." 
  VREME maintains that Pejakovic's "cool public admission" of 
the deportation amounts to an attempt to institutionalize 
lawlessness and to proclaim the manhunt for refugees a normal 
police procedure. Thus, the weekly concludes, this kind of 
lawlessness could be repeated again and again.
