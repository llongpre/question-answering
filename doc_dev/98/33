Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 20 February edition of the Belgrade 
daily POLITIKA, on page 9, attacks an article that appeared in 
the Podgorica, Montenegro, daily POBJEDA "the day before 
yesterday" calling for the secession of Montenegro from the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. POLITIKA states that the POBJEDA 
article's author, Dragan Hajdukovic, a resident of Switzerland, 
is remembered for his pamphlets, published in Switzerland, 
calling for "the bombing of Belgrade" and requesting the 
"imposition of sanctions against his own country." Now he "makes 
an appearance in the domestic press," and, "at a time of paper 
shortages," publishes on "two entire pages" of POBJEDA a 
political program for the "renewal of the Montenegrin state," 
instructing the Montenegrin people "to secede from Yugoslavia." 
Hajdukovic disregards the fact that the large majority of the 
inhabitants of Montenegro declared themselves in favor of a 
joint state, POLITIKA remarks, adding that the editorial staff 
of POBJEDA has already disassociated itself from the article, 
calling it a "glaring error."
