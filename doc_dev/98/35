  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, June 7 (AFP) -- The only 
road link between Albania and Montenegro has been closed to 
traffic for five days, a local daily reported Tuesday. The 
Albanian authorities have forbidden any vehicles from crossing 
into or out of Montenegro -- which together with Serbia forms 
rump-Yugoslavia -- at Bozaj, said Lazar Jankovic, spokesman for 
the Yugoslav Commission for Border Incidents, quoted Tuesday by 
the local daily POBJEDA. The road is open to pedestrians. 
  The Albanian authorties apparently took the action after 
Albanian truck drivers had blocked the border because, Jankovic 
said, they were "unhappy at the changing criteria imposed by 
Yugoslav customs officials." Since a total embargo was imposed 
on Yugoslavia two years ago, the Bozaj border-control post has 
become the focus of traffic in oil and other supplies for the 
Yugoslav market. Several Montenegrins were arrested recently by 
Albanians for trafficking oil, according to rumours which 
Montengrin authorities refuse to confirm. 
  PJOBEDA said it had learnt from unoffical sources that six 
policemen and a Montenegrin customs officer were being 
questioned for their role in the trafficking.
