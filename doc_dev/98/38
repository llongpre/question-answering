  [Text] Podgorica, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- The latest situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina indicates that the most critical stage of 
the crisis has not ended and that the war threatens to spread. 
So says a statement sent to TANJUG by Montenegro's Foreign 
Minister Miodrag Lekic. In his opinion, these are the latest 
tragic consequences of the proclamation and recognition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina without securing a consensus of all three 
constituent peoples beforehand, a principle that was explicitly 
defined in the constitution of that republic at that time. 
  Lekic, however, notes that the fundamental causes of the war 
do not exonerate the warring adventurers belonging to the sides 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina from responsibility for the activities 
which not only continue to cause further suffering among the 
innocent population, but also further diminish the possibility 
of finding a peaceful solution. To unquestioningly give in to 
everything that comes from the top brass cannot be in the 
national interest. This particularly refers to those things 
which irresponsibly undermine the efforts aimed at restoring 
peace. True patriotism, he adds, can be seen in those who, in 
addition to promoting national interests, advocate peace and 
respect for the rights of others and an end to the suffering of 
the population. [passage omitted]
