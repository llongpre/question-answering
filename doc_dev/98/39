<F P=106> [Article by Milenko Pesic: "Concerning Support for </F>
Strengthening the Federal State: Is Centralization Possible in 
the FRY?"] 
  [Text] Slobodan Rakitic, DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
Serbia]: "The federal state has too few authorities"; 
academician Miodrag Jovicic: "A two-member federation has no 
chance of succeeding"; Dr. Pavle Nikolic: "For a unified state 
of Serbs and Montenegrins." 
  Time will tell what the future of Djindjic's idea on the 
need 
to centralize Yugoslavia is. The opposition offered in 
Montenegro to his support for strengthening the federal state 
was more than vehement. 
  Responding to charges by the Montenegrin political public, 
Zoran Djindjic said: "I do not challenge the fact that 
Montenegro has its own statehood and its own symbols and 
sovereignty. However, some questions concerning money and the 
economy must be separated out. There is no equality if someone 
gives 10 dinars and someone else gives 20 dinars, and then they 
have an equal voice in deciding how that money is going to be 
used." 
<H5>  Djindjic in a Rush </H5>
  Many people feel that the disintegration of the SFRY 
[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] first began in the 
monetary sphere. As soon as the stories of who was exploiting 
whom and who was making decisions about money began circulating, 
post-World War II Yugoslavia signed its own death sentence. 
  Two years in the life of the third Yugoslavia as a 
two-member 
federation have been enough to show that not everything in the 
new federal state is functioning smoothly. 
  Slobodan Rakitic, leader of the DEPOS caucus in the Federal 
Assembly, agrees that the federal state has too few authorities. 
  "This is evidenced by the fact that sessions of the two 
chambers of the Federal Assembly are very rare, while 
announcements that the federal government has not prepared bills 
for the legislature are very common. Legislative activities have 
been sharply curtailed, to the benefit of the 
member-states--Serbia and Montenegro," says Rakitic. 
  Rakitic feels that Djindjic was right when he raised the 
question of the competence of the federal state and its 
influence on the political and economic life of the citizens, 
"if one does not want this present-day state to resemble the one 
portrayed in the 1974 Constitution." 
  "Nevertheless, I think that Djindjic has rushed the whole 
story. It would be nice if we as a state could deal with these 
problems now," the head of the DEPOS caucus in the federal 
parliament warns. 
  The current federation has no chance of succeeding, 
academician Miodrag Jovicic believes. 
  "There are three reasons why the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] cannot be effective as a federative state," this 
expert in constitutional law explains. 
  First, the theory and practice of federalism show that 
two-member federations have no chance of succeeding. As his 
second argument, Jovicic cites the differences between Serbia 
and Montenegro in terms of size and economic power; finally, 
there is the Zabljak Constitution, which contains a number of 
weaknesses and numerous confederal elements that were present in 
the former SFRY. 
<H5>  Way Out of Current Situation </H5>
  As a strong critic of the current constitutional solution 
for 
the FRY, Jovicic warns that the supreme legal document grants 
privileges to Montenegro in a number of regards. 
  "There are two ways out of the current situation. One is to 
abolish the current republican and provincial borders and form a 
state of regions. Such a solution would be somewhere between a 
unitary and federal structure for the state," Jovicic 
emphasizes, adding that he is opposed to a unitary state. 
  Jovicic sees another possibility for overcoming the current 
discord between the two members of the federation in granting 
Montenegro special autonomous status, so-called corpum 
separatum, like what the Banovina of Croatia gained in 1939. 
"That means that Montenegro would no longer have its own 
constitution and president," says academician Jovicic. 
  Dr. Pavle Nikolic, a professor at the School of Law and 
federal deputy, also says that the current two-member federation 
is untenable as a solution, because it does not ensure the equal 
rights of the federal units and the equal rights of its citizens. 
  "The two-member federation is fertile ground for sovereignty 
disputes and rivalries, which always bring forth aspirations 
toward confederalism on the one hand and centralism on the other 
hand," Nikolic stresses. 
  Despite the unification of Serbia and Montenegro in 1918, 
the 
post-World War II arrangement, and the constitutional solution 
of 1974, these two states have grown apart over the course of 
time, emphasizing their statehood and sovereignty. 
  "I support a unified state of Serbs and Montenegrins with 
divided democratic-political territorial autonomy, as a 
community of the Serbian and Montenegrin states. Through this 
sort of renunciation of statehood by Serbia and Montenegro, the 
basis for creating a unified statehood of the entire nation 
would be created," Nikolic believes, adding that this would 
avoid centralism, which is inherently undemocratic.
