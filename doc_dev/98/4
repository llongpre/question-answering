  [Excerpts] Budva, 22 May -- After almost two years everyone 
knows that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY] are absurd and unjust. However, even if they 
were just, they need to be more flexible, at least enough to 
acknowledge the basic humanitarian needs. Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic said this at a news conference today 
with a group of international journalists who have been in 
Budva, Montenegro, for three days. They go to Serbia on 23 May. 
  Djukanovic said that the negative consequences of the 
sanctions on the Montenegrin economy have caused more than $5 
billion in damage, with the greatest repercussions on the 
humanitarian situation because Montenegro is supporting about 
50,000 refugees, 20 percent of whom are Muslim. He said 
Montenegro has been coping with a serious humanitarian crisis 
for months. UN bodies have not yet aproved a single request for 
the import of certain goods which would ease humanitarian and 
other problems. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister was frequently asked about 
the 
effects of the sanctions and how long Montenegro will be able to 
endure them. Djukanovic said that the international blockade 
has been a complete fiasco, but if someone is interested in 
testing our ability to suffer, the nation is resilient and can 
endure the imposed hardships. 
  Illustrating the deadly effects of the sanctions, the 
Montenegrin prime minister said the government had already sold 
several vessels from the republic's relatively opulent fleet. 
However, a number of vessels are in danger because they are 
trapped in foreign ports, and the costs of their anchorage are 
growing alarmingly day by day. [passage omitted] 
  Djukanovic was also asked repeatedly about Montenegro's 
position in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic said 
that most citizens of Montenegro would be in favor of a joint 
state with Serbia; others are iin favor of that, but only with 
absolute equality between the federal members. Montenegro will 
not back up on that position by a millimeter, the prime minister 
said. He added that there are secessionist and unitaristic 
political forces in both Montenegro and Serbia. In this context 
he mentioned certain political trends from within the Serbian 
Academy of Science and Arts and certain political views voiced 
at the recent congress of Serbian intellectuals. However, he 
stressed that official policy does not support those views, 
either in Serbia or in Montenegro. 
  Any denial of Montenegro as a separate entity and the denial 
of its equality has a very destructive and destabilizing effect 
on the FRY, Djukanovic warned, and said that the overall 
constitutional commitments do not threaten Montenegro's position 
in any way. [passage omitted]
