  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister 
Radoje Kontic and the premiers of the Yugoslav Republics of 
Serbia and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, on 
Wednesday evening [12 January] backed up an economic recovery 
programme drawn up by a team of Yugoslav experts and agreed to 
start implement the measures contained in it as of next week. 
Yugoslavia desperately needs such a programme to counter the 
effects of an airtight international blockade and monster 
inflation which in December alone reached one million percent. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions on 
Yugoslavia in late May of 1992 for its alleged involvement in 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Kontic, Sainovic and Djukanovic were agreed that the 
anti-inflation and stabilization programme, due to be launched 
on January 17, would ensure an economic independence to the 
country and open prospects for recovery on the basis of 
market-economy principles, the Yugoslav Information Ministry 
said in a statement. The Yugoslav Government on Wednesday 
generally upheld the programme but insisted on some corrections 
and amendments, the statement added. The programme focuses on 
curbing hyperinflation and ensuring monetary stability as a 
precondition for reviving production and improving the living 
standards of the population, the Yugoslav Government said. It 
also said that in the conditions of international sanctions, 
financial backing for the programme should be primarily ensured 
from domestic sources rather than from foreign ones. This 
should not stop actions, however, for deblocking Yugoslav assets 
frozen in foreign banks, settlement of claims that Yugoslavia 
has towards other countries and conclusion of credit and other 
financial arrangements to support the programme, the Federal 
Government said. 
  The government of Serbia on Wednesday backed the programme, 
while the government of Montenegro said on Tuesday that it 
should be used as a basis for seeking how to surmount the 
present economic difficulties and suggested a series of 
alterations. In a letter to the Federal prime minister whose 
content was published on Wednesday, Montenegrin Premier 
Djukanovic said that the programme did not fully take into 
account the effects of the blockade, that it was better suited 
to an open economy and that it implied backing of foreign 
capital. 
  Another shortcoming of the programme, the Montenegrin 
Government said, is that it offers no complete answer as to how 
to revive production and the commodities' market and how to 
mitigate the acute social problems.
