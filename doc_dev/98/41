  [Text] [Announcer] Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic is paying an official visit to Great Britain. We 
have established a direct link with London where Mr. Prime 
Minister [Djukanovic] is. Good day! 
  [Djukanovic] Good day! 
  [Announcer] To get right to the point for the listeners of 
Argument Vise [An Argument More] program -- what is the 
objective of your visit to Great Britain, have you had any 
concrete meetings and talks? 
  [Djukanovic] Together with the deputy prime minister and 
Montenegrin foreign minister I am visiting London at the 
invitation of one of the members of the foreign affairs' 
committee of the lower chamber of the British Parliament. This 
afternoon I am supposed to present my vision of the current 
situation in Yugoslavia in this lower chamber committee. 
  [Announcer] I presume that we will obtain some concrete 
information about your talks there later in the day. 
  [Djukanovic] Hello? 
  [Announcer] Yes, we can hear you. Rather optimistic 
assessments have been coming from Albania, to which you paid an 
official visit beforehand -- that is, mutual satisfaction with 
this visit. Could you say anything more about it for our 
listeners? 
  [Djukanovic] I took the opportunity of the fact that I was 
travelling to London via Albania to hold talks with the Albanian 
Government. We held talks with Prime Minister Meksi, naturally, 
in the presence of the foreign minister and other government 
officials. We discussed the need to intensify mutual relations. 
We took the opportunity to tell Mr. Meksi that the overall 
foreign affairs' goal of the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] is to establish good relations with its neighbors 
and that, within this context, Montenegro has an explicit need 
to establish good, that is to say, better relations with 
Albania, with whom it borders directly, than we have had in the 
past. On that occasion, we discussed some essential issues that 
represent the most important segments of the improvement of 
mutual relations -- the rights of minorities in both countries 
and some vital issues that we perceive as a possibility to 
promote economic and other cooperation. 
  I received assurances that, in accordance with the 
democratic 
changes that are underway in that country, the rights of the 
Serbs and the Montenegrins who live in Albania will receive 
appropriate treatment parallel to a demand that such a policy be 
pursued for the Albanians in the FRY. 
  Naturally, as always, special interest was shown in the 
problem of Kosovo. It seems that there have been some ambiguous 
statements by some diplomatic representatives of some 
superpowers -- I am primarily referring to the statements that 
have been coming from London recently -- which have contributed 
a lot that Albania abandoned the aggressive attitude toward the 
FRY regarding Kosovo, acknowledged that Kosovo is an integral 
part of Serbia and Yugoslavia, and that this issue can only be 
discussed at the level of rights that must be guaranteed to the 
citizens of Albanian ethnicity in Kosovo. 
  I would say that for me all together this was a sign that a 
new leaf has been turned in the attitudes toward this issue and 
in the general FRY-Albanian relations. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much. We wish you all success in 
you visit and activities in London.
