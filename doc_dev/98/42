  [Text] [Vukovic] There is almost general consensus that 
despite the optimism that seemed never to have been greater the 
talks in Geneva and Brussels last week yielded "meager results." 
Does this assessment also apply to Montenegro's vital need for 
the lifting or at least the suspension of the sanctions? 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the diminishing number of 
controversial, although complex issues, it is true that 
optimistic expectations prevailed, and even possibilities for 
the signing of an agreement. In the introductory speech at the 
plenary session, Lord Owen said that very little stood in the 
way of the agreement. The three sides that actually represent 
the three nationalist structures of the authority are more or 
less continuing with their maximalist demands for the time 
being, lacking the readiness to strike a decisive compromise. 
For this reason the pressure of the international community is 
at the moment on all three sides. The Muslim side is now 
assuming greater responsibly for the rejection of the 
Serbian-Croatian agreement, which, formally speaking, reflects 
the opinion of the majority in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the moment. 
True enough, this is a majority born out of a suspicious 
alliance like the earlier Croatian-Muslim alliance that sufficed 
for the international community to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
by which the fire in this republic was definitely lit. 
  However, an agreement of the three sides, a principle that 
should have been respected from the very beginning, can be 
reached in the coming rounds of the talks. As is known, the 
signing of the peace agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina parallel to 
the favorable development of other elements of the peace process 
will open a perspective for the progressive suspension, that is 
to say, lifting of the sanctions, which gives rise to certain, 
naturally, moderate optimism. 
  [Vukovic] My impression is that certain "sub-questions" are 
unexpectedly (in light of the assurances by the state 
leadership) getting complicated or perhaps this is merely 
becoming evident now. I am primarily thinking of Prevlaka. 
  [Lekic] A part of the so-called European Union position 
paper refers to the demands that the Muslim and also the Serbian 
side gain access to the sea. The actual circumstances of these 
efforts are hypothetical for the time being. 
  Throughout the entire course of diplomatic activities, 
including this latest one, the position and insistence of our 
republic was that Prevlaka belongs to Montenegro. The present 
compromise solution for Prevlaka, as perhaps the only 
observation of the conclusions of the London conference, has 
brought no serious incidents, which was noted with satisfaction 
at the last plenary conference. However, a fair and definitive 
decision will be reached when Prevlaka formally falls to 
Montenegro. 
  [Vukovic] What about the demand that the blockade of Bar 
harbor be lifted to receive humanitarian aid? By the way, to 
what degree did the "assistance" of Radovan Karadzic [president 
of the Serbian Republic] and [FRY Foreign Minister] Vladislav 
Jovanovic help this initiative? 
  [Lekic] The committee for sanctions at the demand of 
incumbent Montenegrin authorities and the FAO [UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization] on 11 June 1993 passed a general 
decision to open Bar harbor for the humanitarian aid to the 
former Yugoslav republics. The renewed operation of this harbor 
has been postponed. It is only left to us to analyze why this 
decision is not being put into effect and, naturally, to fight 
for its alteration. 
  [Vukovic] Immediately upon their return from Brussels, 
[Montenegrin] President Bulatovic said that "in normal times 
there would be much less need for Montenegro as well as Serbia 
to have independent diplomacy," and that "it is much better that 
we strive toward observation of the federal Constitution and 
leave this activity to the federal organs." Many understood 
this statement as characteristic of the president's laying of 
the ground for the abolition of your ministry? 
  [Lekic] I have no knowledge of preparing the ground for the 
abolition of the ministry nor that this issue is topical. I 
know that so far the Montenegrin president of the republic and 
the prime minister have favored the normal functioning of the 
ministry, among other reasons, to adhere to the Constitution. 
  [Vukovic] Until recently your departure to the post of 
ambassador in Rome has been "topical" in the corridors and 
lately there has also been some talk that you might take the 
post of federal foreign minister. I presume that you have heard 
about both options and my question is: Is there any substance 
in either of them? 
  [Lekic] Between Rome and Belgrade I would give priority to 
Podgorica, naturally for as long as I enjoy the trust of the 
public and the authorities in power. Within my decisionmaking 
domain I shall give priority to what I judge to be in the 
interest of our republic. 
  [Vukovic] To sum up -- even when Montenegro's 
international status normalizes, is there a reason for 
Montenegro to remain without its own diplomacy? 
  [Lekic] In any form of normalization you speak of there will 
be no serious arguments for Montenegro's remaining without its 
own diplomacy. On the contrary, valid historic and state 
interests exist for the continuation of this important attribute 
of Montenegrin statehood. 
  [Vukovic] The Peoples' Party and the Serbian Radical Party 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with your work and believe 
that you are pursuing a "separatist" diplomacy for Montenegro. 
Please comment. 
  [Lekic] I strive for the reputation, the interests, and the 
international recognizability of Montenegro by acknowledging 
reality, naturally, all this not at others' expense. Those who 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with such efforts at the 
same time do not conceal their attitude or intentions toward 
Montenegro. 
  Regarding the Peoples' Party, I would not judge it on the 
basis of the statements and moves by some of its 
representatives. In other words, I would like to believe that 
there are many among its members and sympathizers who respect 
Montenegro and its state and henceforth support the state 
activities that are in its interest. 
  [Vukovic] In the Montenegrin opposition block there is also 
certain mistrust in you. 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the outlined principles we are 
striving for, I have some difficulty in identifying my 
antagonism to all the forces that truly and rationally work for 
the interests of Montenegro. If you are referring to the 
mistrust of those who in the foreign affairs sphere constantly 
champion foreign military intervention against the Serbs in 
Bosnia and the extension and tightening of sanctions, thus, for 
something that does not significantly differ from, for example, 
the official views of Turkey, then I would not comment, for, I 
hope, wholly rational reasons. In any case, all political 
forces perfectly legitimately strive to gain power and personal 
aspirations should be treated as normal. 
  [Vukovic] It seems to me that the so-called Serbian block of 
parties in Montenegro is irritated by the manner in which you 
conduct the Montenegrin foreign policy, as well as your clear 
identification as a Montenegrin in a national sense. Has 
somebody from the ruling party (among those who claim that 
"Montenegrinhood [crnogorstvo] without Serbianhood [srpstvo]" is 
not possible) reproached you for anything in this sense? 
  [Lekic] I am not aware of anyone reproaching me for anything 
like this. 
  [Vukovic] What is, therefore, your attitude toward 
Montenegrinhood with or without Serbianhood, especially in 
concrete contemporary political events? 
  [Lekic] I was always repulsed by the mythologizing of the 
intolerant idea of ethnocentrism. I must admit that we perceive 
terms like Serbianhood and Montenegrinhood, which otherwise 
frequently cause people intellectual and other excitement, as 
expressions of romantic rhetoric and old-fashioned pathos. I 
have never heard, for example, the terms Englishhood or 
Frenchhood although these are big and old nations. 
  Aspirations of individual political factions that are based 
on the past and the attempts to accomplish the mythical and 
mystical variant instead of the sober and contemporary option, 
give rise to big errors. Political demagogues are transforming 
the mythical variant into altogether lowly political goals. 
Instead of controversies and mystification of Serbianhood and 
Montenegrinhood, the question of the Montenegrin-Serbian state 
interests is the one that rationally poses itself. I favor the 
search for rational state relations, economic, and cultural 
cooperation, by which historic alliances as well as state and 
legal peculiarities (of Montenegro and Serbia, two old counties) 
would be reinstated at the same time. 
  [Vukovic] The elections in Serbia are over. The electoral 
campaign has shown that literally all the parties there consider 
the present Yugoslavia to be a transitional solution on the way 
to the final goal -- the alliance of the Serbian lands. Do you 
keep to the position you stated in POBJEDA this April that such 
an initiative is unacceptable for Montenegro because Montenegro 
has an established state and national awareness, and the recent 
one in THE INDEPENDENT that Montenegro has its own tradition of 
statehood and does not wish to embark upon an adventure by which 
it would risk the loss of its own identity? Can you imagine 
Montenegro in such a state formation and yourself as the foreign 
minister in the republican government, if Montenegro were to 
have one at all then? 
  [Lekic] I can immediately answer that I do not see myself 
as foreign minister in such a formation. I would also like to 
state my opinion that all peoples have a legitimate right to 
self-determination, the Serbs included. I am not familiar with 
the concept of such an alliance but I presume that it is 
necessary to respect the will of all who are envisaged for such 
an alliance. 
  I did not change my opinion regarding Montenegro as a civic 
state and the alliance of the Serbian lands, which I have 
clearly explained in POBJEDA and recently in London's THE 
INDEPENDENT. In any case the Montenegrin state is not for sale. 
I believe that its centennial continuity will continue in the 
forms on which the majority of its citizens will decide and 
which the minority will democratically respect. Faced with the 
new historic challenges and experiences, Montenegro, an old 
state, that is to say, the Montenegrin people with recognizable 
state and national identity, will know how to chose their 
historic ways. In these bleak historic times we are all again 
sitting the test of historical maturity and ethics. If we are 
worthy of Montenegro and its pure and exalted idea, we will not 
make a wrong choice. 
  [Vukovic] What kind of Montenegro would you by no means wish 
to see in the future? 
  [Lekic] I would not like our political, cultural, and 
religious differences transformed into clashes that would later, 
depending on the winner, lead into Manichaean division into 
heroes and traitors. In this century alone our ancient 
divisions have left sorrow and scars on the Montenegrin people, 
who live with history, bearing it as a tragic burden. 
  For this reason it is our duty to reach a political and 
cultural consensus regardless of all the differences so that by 
collective responsibility we meet the present challenges.
