  [Text] Podgorica, May 24 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions 
have almost completely destroyed the merchant fleet of 
Montenegro which accounted for about 20 percent of the 
republic's annual foreign currency revenue and five percent of 
its entire earnings. Estimates are that the two-year isolation 
has caused damages exceeding 200 million dollars to two major 
maritime companies: `Prekookeanska Plovidba' of the Adriatic 
part of Bar and `Jugooceanija' of Kotor. A total of 37 
Montenegrin ships, totalling 977,000 dwt, have been stranded in 
various ports throughout the world. 
  Cargo transport, port reloading and shipbuilding activities 
have ground to a complete halt, said Radomir Mugosa, the 
secretary of the Association of Maritime Economy in the 
Montenegrin Chamber of Economy. He added that the 1993 
maintenance costs of ships belonging to `Prekookeanska Plovidba' 
and `Jugooceania' and which are stranded in foreign ports 
exceeded 50 million dollars. In order to preserve the bulk of 
their fleets, the two companies were in 1993 forced to sell two 
ships with a dwt of over 80,000. 
  The port of Bar, which is capable of reloading five million 
tonnes of goods, has not had any earnings because no ships have 
entered it over the past two years, Mugosa said. He added that 
the shipbuilding yard `Veljko Vlahovic,' in Bijela, has also 
suspended its activities although it used to overhaul between 
80-100 ships before the sanctions.
