<F P=106> [Commentary by Frane Plancic: "Montenegro Under Military </F>
Management?"] 
  [Text] Serbian plans for Montenegro have long been known, 
and they have long been implemented without any great problems, 
in cooperation with [President of Montenegro] Bulatovic and 
[Prime Minister] Djukanovic, the duo in power. What is not known 
are the Serbian plans for solving the expected secessionist 
crisis in Montenegro. However, there are certain indications of 
these plans, such as the deployment of the means for a 
preventative solution to this crisis by force, which have 
already been carried out. Naturally, the matter involves the 
Yugoslav Army (the Serbian armed forces), whose troops are on 
the alert because of the "constant danger from Croatia and 
Albania." 
  Belgrade is prepared to solve this "secessionist crisis" 
either by introducing martial law or by war. In either case, 
what Serbia must have is the following: territory clear of 
Albanians and Croats, a short period to apply armed force, 
achieved by deploying force on the crisis territories at the 
appropriate time, and, finally, to keep the situation on the 
borders with Albania and Croatia politically unstable, so that 
"internal intervention" could be covered and justified by 
external reasons. 
  The plans for the additional militarization of the Lustica 
peninsula (the Boka Kotorska bay), Valdinos cove (near Ulcinj), 
and Krnjicko Oko (on Lake Skadarsko) thus assume a clear 
political and military meaning. Belgrade's plan is accompanied 
by a request for building apartments for about 10,000 officers 
and their families. 
  Most of all this is being planned in eastern Herzegovina, 
densely populated by autochthonous Albanians. It clearly 
follows that "cleansing" is being planned. At the same time, 
Serbs are being settled in the area, so with additional 
militarization a favorable "balance of power" in relation to the 
Montenegrin "secessionists" is being achieved. The 
militarization of Lustica and the advanced cleansing of the 
autochthonous Croats in Boka is being guided by the same 
principle. 
  The decision to turn the Lustica peninsula into a military 
range and the construction of a naval port (base, stronghold) at 
Valdinos is primarily an open threat to Montenegrin sovereignty, 
and indirectly also to Croatia and Albania, since it is assumed 
that these countries will act aggressively toward Montenegrin 
territory. 
  The naval port of Valdinos does not only have a "land" 
purpose (threatening the Montenegrin secessionists), but its 
primary task is to hold the Serbian fleet that needs to secure 
for Belgrade a part in controlling the sea and the traffic in 
the wider Otranto area, especially when the lifting of the 
sanctions or a laxer regime of navigation and traffic is 
expected, as is constantly being announced in Belgrade. A more 
acceptable explanation has been put forward in the Montenegrin 
public -- that all this is a question of defense measures. 
  Viewed more passively, this represents the redeployment of 
the fleet from Boka, where the ships are within the range of 
Croatian weapons. Moreover, it would be difficult for the many 
different ships and submarines to sail out on time, fast, and in 
an orderly manner. 
  Valdinos Cove offers much better opportunities for active 
defense measures, at least insofar as it is further from Croatia 
and as it is easier to sail out of. However, all the other 
conditions are less favorable than those at Boka. This cove is 
only a mile long, the water 5 to 15 meters deep, and it is 
surrounded by hills that are, on average, two to three times 
lower than those at Boka, and open to strong winter winds. When 
one sails out of the cove, as is the case with Boka, the ships 
are in the open, at the mercy of a superior opponent from the 
air, the sea, or under the sea. Particular drawbacks are the 
fact that all the work has to be done from scratch (where will 
this kind of money come from?), that it will take a long time, 
and then there is also the hinterland with which Valdinos has 
very weak traffic and other connections. 
  After all, is the best indication not Belgrade silently 
overlooking the fact that Valdinos is not the best choice? 
There are several coves more appropriate for the purpose, but 
the "trouble" is that there is no Albanian or Croatian 
population there. 
  While talking to several senior Croatian Navy officials, we 
agreed that Montenegro (when it truly is Montenegro) will have 
the legitimate right to establish its own navy, in accordance 
with its defense needs, and also to take all passive and active 
security measures. However, they stated that the warships at 
Boka are neither Montenegrin property (but Serbian, while they 
are waiting for the division to be legally resolved), nor a 
factor of legitimate defense. Moreover, it is not such a bad 
thing that the Serbian fleet has been moving further away from 
our border. 
  It is quite another matter as to what will happen when 
Montenegro becomes the Republic of Montenegro, and when it has 
to defend itself on all sides against a spreading Belgrade 
aggression. The Slovenes, Croatians, Muslims, and Albanians had 
no other solution. It is therefore probably not necessary to 
point out that we are not dealing with fools and politically 
illiterate megalomaniacs such as Admiral Isakovic -- who 
addresses the people from The Galeb [formerly Tito's ship] in 
the manner of Tito -- but with clear-headed criminals who could 
be said to rank among the most notorious in the world.
