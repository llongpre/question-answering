  [Text] Tirana, May 26 (ATA) -- On May 22-23, 1994, the 
financial police in cooperation with the Ministry of Public 
Order and the Attorney General's Office exercised control in the 
border areas along the Buna River and the Lake of Shkodra to 
intercept Montenegro bound smugglers of fuel. Three tankers, an 
IFA [expansion unknown] vehicle, and a van which had transported 
fuel as well as three persons filling barrels with fuel to be 
moved across the border were intercepted in the area of Kamice 
village. 
  Four motor boats coming from Montenegro, five Montenegrin 
citizens and an Albanian, who had come to get fuel from barrels 
along the Lake of Shkodra, were intercepted in the area of the 
Kasan village. Another 14 Albanian citizens, who were making 
ready to ship the fuel by motor boat were intercepted as well. 
Among them was a person armed with a hunting rifle. 
  Barrels of fuel and three Albanian citizens, smuggling 
fuels, 
were intercepted in the Samrish village along the Buna River. 
Also, Montenegrin motor boats which has crossed the Albanian 
water frontier for fuel contraband were intercepted. 
  In the area of the Murriqan village, again along the Buna 
River, three Albanians were intercepted while smuggling fuel 
across the frontier in collaboration with Montenegrins, who fled 
immediately on a motor-boat as the Albanian order forces 
intervened. 
  In the end of the control on contraband and violation of the 
embargo imposed by the United Nations, acts which run counter to 
the laws of the Albanian state, 24 Albanian and five Montenegrin 
citizens were denounced for criminal prosecution, and five 
vehicles, about 160 barrels of oil as well as large quantities 
of empty barrels were intercepted. 
  It is not the first time that the financial police bodies 
and 
those of the public order have exercised unexpected controls to 
prevent smuggling of fuel into Montenegro. Over the recent 
months, pipes were discovered in the Lake of Shkodra, which 
served the transportation of these fuels into the Montenegrin 
territory. Several tankers have also been intercepted recently 
in Malesia e Madhe, which had transported fuel out of the 
Albanian frontiers. For this reason, customs officials as well 
as public order employees of the border crossing point were 
detained.
