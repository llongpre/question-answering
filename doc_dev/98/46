  [Text] Podgorica, Jan 20 (AFP) -- More than 100 Bosnian 
Serb refugees in Montenegro have been drafted by Bosnian Serb 
forces, with the complicity of local authorities and the rump 
Yugoslav army, an opposition official said Thursday [20 January]. 
  Movement orders addressed to the refugee "reservists" began 
arriving by mail 10 days ago, Montenegro Social Democratic Party 
official Milorad Raznjatovic said here. The call-up is being 
carried out in collaboration with the rump Yugoslav army and the 
Montenegro police, Raznjatovic said. Movement orders received 
by one refugee, sent by the "defence ministry" of the 
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, instructed him to report 
to a Yugoslav army barracks in Tivat, Montenegro, "in order to 
fulfil his military obligations in the Serbian republic army," 
he said. 
  Should the draftee fail to report, he will be "questioned," 
the orders specify. Bosnian Serb authorities are apparently 
well-informed about the refugees in Montenegro, Raznjatovic 
said, as the movement orders were correctly addressed to each 
refugee. The head of the Montenegro Refugee Commission, Djordje 
Scepanovic, denied any collaboration with Bosnian Serb 
authorities. "The forced call-up of refugees by the country 
they fled from is forbidden by the Geneva Convention on 
refugees," Scepanovic told AFP. 
  The Bosnian Serb forces have often called on the refugees to 
enlist, but "on a voluntary basis, not by call-up orders and 
warnings," he said. The movement orders call on the refugees to 
serve in Herzegovina, in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the 
Bosnian Serb army is fighting to take control of Olovo, a 
strategic site north of Sarajevo on the route to Tuzla 
[geographical information as received].
