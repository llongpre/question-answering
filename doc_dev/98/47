<F P=106> [Commentary by Dragoljub Vukovic: "Montenegrinhood Virus </F>
Activated"] 
  [Text] At the recent extraordinary session of the Peoples' 
Party of Montenegro in Kotor, the amendment to the statute, 
which was supposed to emphasize the Serbian dimension of the 
party, was not passed. In connection with this precise 
amendment, a senior party official, Vice President Dr. Bozidar 
Bojovic, remarked that the excessive display of Serbian 
sentiments has done more harm than good to the party. Not long 
after this, a split within the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] of 
Montenegro, the second strongest Serbian party in the republic, 
unexpectedly took place when a group of three federal deputies 
(Dusan Boskovic, Radovan Vukcevic, and Slavoljub Scekic) 
renounced their loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj [head of the SRS 
in Serbia] and opposed the decision to make the SRS "unitarian," 
thus negating the autonomy of the Radicals in Montenegro. This 
opposition has been portrayed as defense of "the honorable state 
of Montenegro," to which the untouchable leader of the Serbian 
Radicals responded with an accusation that those who were until 
recently his assistants have verged toward "Montenegrin 
separatists." 
  Under the leadership of Dr. Novak Kilibarda, who has proved 
to be a much more skillful politician than many thought, the 
Peoples' Party of Montenegro has been suspected of 
insufficiently emphasizing its Serbian nature and not showing 
enough concern for Serbian interests on several occasions. It 
has transpired, however, that those who left the party because 
of these suspicions and formed new ones, have done a service to 
Dr. Kilibarda and his "populists [members of the Peoples' 
party]" and condemned themselves to the political wilderness. 
Without abandoning the realm of the national, Dr. Kilibarda, 
with the support of younger and more emancipated people around 
him, has tried (and to a great extent succeeded) to spare the 
Peoples' Party of being the exporter of Serbianity to 
Montenegro. Unlike some others, "the populists," have realized 
that there is no great number of Serbs in Montenegro who would, 
in place of their Montenegrin caps, stick a Serbian cap 
[sajkaca] on their heads. Even though they do not accept the 
Montenegrins as a separate nation, their support for the 
preservation of the Montenegrin state's integrity within the 
federal association with Serbia (and other Serbian lands) makes 
them a potential partner of those political forces in Montenegro 
that care about this statehood, too, but add national autonomy 
of the Montenegrins to it. The very fact that the Peoples' 
Party of Montenegro does not question Montenegro being a state 
("with Serbia always, under Serbia never") points to the 
acknowledgement of a special Montenegrin political subjectivity, 
independently of whether a clear idea about this exists with 
"the populists" or not. For the Serbian nationalists, prone to 
unitarist ideas and amalgamation, such a Peoples' Party is 
potentially "separatist" and their side uses the slightest hint 
of proximity between "the populists" and the Liberal Alliance to 
produce direct or indirect accusations in this sense. 
  Speaking of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro attempts to 
emancipate itself from romantic and rudimentary nationalism and 
emphasize its democratic and civic traits, it is also worth 
bearing in mind that its leaders wish to place the party within 
the framework of Western political culture. "Gentlemen, there 
is an association of the democratic parties of the world, or 
rather of the Euro-American civilization, and many parties tried 
to profile themselves so that they could enter this association 
in as inconspicuous a manner as possible. Because when one 
joins, you know, one wins many favors," Dr. Kilibarda emphasized 
at the party convention in Kotor. 
  Unlike the Peoples' Party, which had the hallmark of an 
authentic Montenegrin display of Serbian sentiments from the 
outset, the SRS entered Montenegrin territory as an echo of 
Seselj's nationalist and chauvinist uproar, and has more or less 
remained at this political level. 
  Suddenly, the unexpected unity has given way to discord, 
while the loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj has transformed itself 
into accusations about dictatorship and the like. When Milika 
Dacevic, better known as Ceko, whom Seselj had made a war lord 
and then stripped him of the function, introduced him to the 
Federal Parliament and then chased him out, says: "We are not 
peasant Serbs from Serbia, we are Serbs from Montenegro," then 
it is not improper to conclude that the incubation period of the 
Montenegrinhood virus is over even among some Radicals. It may 
be true what Vojislav Seselj has been saying about Boskovic, 
Vukcevic, and Scekic, namely, that they turned against him 
because he dismissed them as not capable enough; however, the 
seriousness of the warnings by Dusan Boskovic about the risks of 
a policy that ignores Montenegro's specific status cannot be 
overlooked. 
  Departing from the assumption that one can equally display 
Montenegrin and Serbian sentiments in Montenegro, based on the 
example of the Peoples' Party and the SRS, one can conclude that 
it is more difficult for the Serbian political parties to 
resolve this paradox than for the Montenegrin ones. The 
political parties that do not question the ethnic specifics of 
the Montenegrins naturally also appear as the firmest guarantors 
of Montengrin statehood. Their dilemma can only be: Should the 
state be independent or integrated in a sort of border 
community. The Serbian political parties, however, are torn 
between Serbian integrationist tendencies and a Montenegrin 
specificity that they cannot circumvent. Their defense of 
statehood can be sincere, but it lacks sufficient basis, while 
their blatant negation of this statehood is plunging them from 
the heights of Mt. Lovcen among "the common" Serbs, to which 
most of them would agree only with difficulty. However, by 
staying at these heights, regardless of the fact that they might 
nationally feel Serbian, they are subconsciously becoming 
Montenegrins in a political sense.
