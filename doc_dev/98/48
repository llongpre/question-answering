  [Text] Podgorica, 18 May (TANJUG) -- Talks were held today 
between Momir Bulatovic, Montenegrin president and member of the 
Supreme Defense Council, and top Yugoslav Army officers. At the 
talks, they concluded that officers and commands of the Yugoslav 
Army have displayed a high degree of responsibility for the 
overall combat readiness of their troops under very complex 
circumstances. 
  As it has been announced, the commanders of the First, 
Second, and Third Armies -- Generals Jevrem Cokic, Bozidar 
Babic, and Dusan Samardzic respectively -- General Ljubisa 
Velickovic, commander of the Air Force and anti-aircraft 
defense, and Navy Commander Admiral Dojcilo Isakovic informed 
Bulatovic about the level of combat readiness of the strategic 
formations under their command, the implementation of measures 
set by the Supreme Defense Council relating to the security of 
the state territory under present conditions, further 
transformation of the Yugoslav Army, and other issues. 
  Stable financing, in line with the capabilities of the 
state, 
will enable the speedier resolution of problems in supplying 
units with state-of-the-art equipment and in securing better 
living standards for the Yugoslav Army.
