Montenegrin Energy Officials: 19 Million Dinars for Power Plant 
Repairs"] 
  [Text] The governor requested a precise specification 
of costs; national income must double over the coming months; 
demand that petroleum be exempted from all duty. 
  Niksic, 6 Jun--In order to perform essential repairs on 
Montenegrin electric power plants--at Perucica, Pivo, and 
Pljevlja--19 million dinars must be secured in the shortest 
term. The electric power industry does not have the money, and 
if all the deposits in Montenegrin banks were devoted to the 
repairs, the electric power installations would barely be put in 
order. But the demand that prices be increased will not be 
popular with the government. 
  The governor of the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia], Prof. 
Dragoslav Avramovic, listened politely to energy officials and, 
wielding figures, he "slightly lowered" their demands as he 
went. Because the repairs must be made to the installations, 
Avramovic and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Krunoslav 
Vukcevic said that the energy officials should precisely 
calculate the costs and send those figures to the government and 
governor so that this work, which cannot wait, is done solidly 
and on time. 
  The energy officials also mentioned the possibility of 
paying 
off debts by increasing the price of electricity. However, 
Avramovic said that his program looked at the infrastructure as 
a whole, but that it is now obvious that there are major price 
imbalances in this area. Although prices of electric power are 
low (one-third of the world price), the prices of 
telecommunication services and railroad transportation are 
equally above prices in the world, and something must be done in 
that sector. 
  One of the sore spots in Montenegrin economic life is 
petroleum. Energy officials are seeking to secure from the 
national energy pool the quantity of petroleum provided for 
Montenegro, while "Jugopetrol" director Nikola Dragomanovic put 
forward the demand that petroleum derivatives, which we import 
at prices two to five times higher than the price on the world 
market, be exempted from customs duty and that the market for 
petroleum in our country be free. 
  "If we got rid of customs duty, excise taxes, and controls 
over petroleum, what would happen then?" the governor asked. 
  "The supply would probably be better, with lower prices," 
Dragomanovic responded. 
  In response the comment by some of the participants in the 
meeting that food is expensive in our country, more expensive 
than in the world, Avramovic said that those calculations are 
not accurate, which does not mean that food cannot be cheaper. 
  There was also discussion of wages, whereby the governor 
said 
that it is inexplicable that wages have risen enormously for 
some structures in Serbia, even though they are still low 
compared to world levels.
