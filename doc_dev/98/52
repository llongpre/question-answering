  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 24 Jan (TANJUG) -- The new dinar has 
not yet arrived in Montenegro, Todor Cicmil, director of the 
Treasury Department of the Montenegrin National Bank, told a 
TANJUG reporter this morning. According to him, the first 
delivery of the "super" dinar is expected during the day, in 
sufficient quantities for the pensions of about 70,000 
Montenegrin pensioners. [passage omitted] 
  Mirko Paroski, the manager of the central post office in 
Novi 
Sad, has said that postmen could not distribute pensions to more 
than 15,000 pensioners today because the Financial Transaction 
Service has not yet sent out the new dinars. The service should 
have sent out 585,000 new dinars today and tomorrow. 
Consequently, Paroski says, the post office will only start 
delivering pensions tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  The new dinars have not yet appeared in the busiest post 
office in Belgrade either, and the payment of pensions has been 
postponed until further notice, a TANJUG reporter was told today 
by Milan Radulovic, the manager of the Belgrade-3 post office. 
According to him, transactions in old dinars function as 
normal. [passage omitted] 
  The initial implementation of the federal government's new 
measures failed to meet the expectations in eastern Serbia too. 
This is the inevitable conclusion resulting from reports from 
commercial banks in Zajecar, Bor, Pozarevac, and Smederevo, 
which stress that this morning they could not pay part of 
January pensions due to a shortage of cash. [passage omitted]
