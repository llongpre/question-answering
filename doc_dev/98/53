<F P=106> [Report by Dragan Djuric: "To the Last German Mark"] </F>
  [Text] The debate on the set of acts by which the program 
of reconstruction of the monetary system has been brought into 
operation was held in a half-empty conference hall of the 
Assembly. Thanks to the deputies of the Democratic Party of 
Socialists [DPS], the hall was filled only during the voting. 
This time, the quorum was ensured in time, and all 11 acts have 
been adopted without any major problems. Even Federal Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic performed his role of a cog in the voting 
machinery honestly, making no efforts to help his republican 
colleague and party comrade [Milo Djukanovic] in the 
argumentation and defense of the program, the main supporter of 
which is actually Kontic himself. It seems as though the 
silence of the DPS during the hot debate on the latest 
anti-inflation program was calculated. The entire activity of 
the ruling party's deputies boiled down to occasional attempts 
to irritate the opposition. This time it is the party's 
professional, Milutin Ojdanic, who was particularly active in 
such attempts, together with the usual Beba Dzakovic and Danilo 
Vuksanovic. 
<H5>  Prime Minister in Clinch </H5>
  [Montenegrin] Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic was not 
particularly convincing. Which is no wonder. It is difficult 
for anybody, except Sveto Marovic, to talk convincingly about 
something that he or she does not believe in. As for the 
long-term effects of Avramovic's program, nobody intelligent -- 
except, perhaps, Professor Mile Markovic -- believes in them. 
While he was retelling the contents of that program, he 
irresistibly reminded us of the good old days when he elaborated 
the party doctrine in communities. The DPS deputies did not 
react to the competent expert and political remarks by the 
opposition to the proposed program. They left Djukanovic to 
fight alone. The prime minister was courageously getting into a 
clinch, but it was also clear to him that he was giving a 
lecture on a very general topic. 
  Basically, the game was quite clear. The authorities were 
making efforts to use the Assembly as a cover, and to water down 
the responsibility for the imminent failure of the program by 
telling stories about a political consensus. Thus the members 
of the opposition were told in advance that it would be resented 
if the program failed to succeed as a result of their 
obstruction. 
  Milos Radulovic clarified the meaning vividly. When 
engineers plan a plane, it will certainly fly, which cannot be 
said for the planning of economic programs. And that is 
precisely because of the limitations that cannot be influenced 
by the government, since they are brought about by people and 
their conduct. Such a mechanism for creating enemies did not 
remain unrecognized. Though everybody competed in exposing this 
mechanism, still, the most convincing were populists and 
liberals. "The ruling party cannot demand our absolute and 
unconditional support for the program, and if that support fails 
to come, to declare us traitors," Dragan Soc said. 
  "The program is yours, you adopted it without asking for our 
opinion, and you are implementing it without our participation." 
The radicals were less eye-catching this time. They did not 
demand any consciousness-raising [osvestavanje] regarding the 
program this time. 
  The populists tried to refrain from any detailed discussion, 
and to toss the hot potato of responsibility into the hands of 
the DPS. Their general attitude is: "Why did you not adopt this 
program earlier? May the ruling party take all the credit for 
the program if it succeeds, but if it fails, it ought to take 
the consequences." Misko Vukovic took upon himself to explain 
the populists' unprincipledness by asking: "How could the party 
whose minister in the Federal Government, that is the actual 
architect of the program, is in charge of one of the most 
important departments -- employment and social care -- how could 
that party possibly dissociate itself from the program? In 
response, Djukanovic made efforts to show the people that the 
People's Party is unprepared to responsibly take part in dealing 
with the burden that the current period is bringing about. 
<H5>  Refreshment of Mind </H5>
  The liberals tried the impossible, to force the DPS into 
assuming responsibility for the implementation of the program: 
"If the program fails, can you, gentlemen from the DPS, bind 
your fate to it, and will you, in that, case announce early 
democratic elections?" "The DPS is ready to assume the 
responsibility, because the program has been elaborated by 
experts, and it has won, if not an absolute, then a dominant 
support of the economic intelligentsia of this country," 
Djukanovic responded. 
  Nevertheless, the Montenegrin prime minister put the key 
responsibility for the implementation of the program on the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia and the Office for Monetary Traffic 
[Sluzba za platni promet] that are supposed to protect the 
program from misuse. Petrovic's polemics referred to the 
elections: "All your projects have failed. If I had been you, 
I would have resigned as early as after the first failure, while 
you, you do not even allow elections after so many failures." 
The leader of the liberals adequately disturbed the atmosphere 
in the Assembly by efforts to refresh the memory of the regime 
representatives, reminding them of their countless "optimistic 
starts." The essence of his performance would be: Montenegro 
is looking more and more like Enver Hoxha's Albania because of 
the projects are based on great deceptions, while the latest 
program regarding the super-dinar is actually a super-swindle, a 
preparation for the introduction of a state of emergency. 
  Djukanovic made sure that each question received a proper 
answer. He connected the liberals with the odious West "that is 
mercilessly starving our children," and thereby "morally 
identified" the liberals' treason, as the, this time, quite 
reticent Marovic would say. However, in polemics, one 
frequently blurts out some quite important things. Djukanovic 
maintained that the lifting of the sanctions does not depend 
solely on Yugoslavia, and even explained that the government 
elaborated the program because it can no longer wait for the 
international community to recognize its mistake and lift the 
sanctions!? The Montenegrin prime minister also explained that 
the program actually means a return to the elementary economic 
alphabet, which will do away with the sweet illusion of the 
primary issue of money. Still, while saying that, he forgot his 
own statement that it is precisely the government that 
(independently from the elementary economic alphabet) 
consciously and deliberately went for that sweet illusion, and 
functioned with it quite well for a long time. 
  The social-democrats were particularly straightforward in 
their critique of the program. Zarko Rakcevic pointed out that 
everybody is aware of the necessity of endorsing such a program, 
since the further rise of the inflationary spiral will lead 
directly into an abyss. The cut was inevitable, but the 
question is still open: Whether it was a real cut, and whether 
it was made in the right place. The real causes of the existing 
situation are in the sphere of politics, and they cannot be 
eliminated by an economic program. Therefore the ruling party is 
wrong when it claims that the program has no alternative. It 
has, but for that alternative one has to change the trend in 
politics. The planned expansion of the monetary union to both 
Krajinas [in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina] means, actually, 
financing the war in a different way. "Such a manifestation of 
imperialistic policy will not find any support abroad," Rakcevic 
said. The crucial problem that exists in the program is the 
deficit of the public spending. The possibilities for that 
deficit to be really covered are quite unclear and doubtful. 
The fear that the pressure might be so great that in two months 
the printing of fake money would start again is quite justified 
as it happens, some extraordinary measures can be expected. 
"Let us not allow the last remaining reserves of the citizens 
to be exhausted in a fruitless battle," Dragisa Burzan warned. 
<H5>  Disobedient Dealers </H5>
  All in all, the opposition acted as an opposition, while the 
authorities acted as authorities. For the Montenegrin political 
circumstances even that is a considerable step forward. The 
program has been adopted without the accord of the opposition, 
who made great efforts, particularly the liberals and the 
social-democrats, to state their own views of how to get out 
from the civilizational blind alley. The way out is in a change 
of the overall political atmosphere. "It is necessary that 
Montenegro finally and resolutely dissociates itself from the 
policy of violently tailoring and destroying our former 
fatherland, and that the authorities finally stop disintegrating 
the state-making and national being of its people, and 
disturbing the cultural, religious, and national balance that 
has always existed in this part of the world," Dragan Ivancevic 
said. 
  Regardless of certain interpretations of the program that 
allege it is to buy time for the government, the set of 11 
taxation laws, by which the implementation of the program 
(regarding public revenues, employment, contributions to 
welfare, the tax on profit, the tax on property, the tax on 
citizens' incomes, the turnover tax, the tax on private firms) 
has been brought into operation, was adopted in a very short 
time. 
  That same evening, with the Assembly debate still going on, 
the street dealers in Podgorica were already exchanging 10 
German marks for 11 super-dinars.
