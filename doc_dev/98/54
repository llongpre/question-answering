  [Excerpt] Geneva, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- This year's first 
round of peace negotiations began in Geneva's Palace of Nations 
shortly before 1300 today. Lord Owen and [Thorvald] Stoltenberg 
invited the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia as 
well as the leaders of the three warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to find ways of communicating and eventually 
to sign a peace agreement. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said on arrival at 
Geneva Airport that "the Serbian side has fulfilled its share of 
obligations" and that "now it is the Muslim side and the 
international community which should fulfill their share of 
obligations regarding the adoption of a peace plan and an end to 
sanctions." 
  Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic expressed the 
following hopes: "The EC should make its move and fulfill what 
it should fulfill -- this means lifting the sanctions." 
  Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic stressed: "In all our 
work so far and all our results, as well as in the commitments 
expressed by the Assembly of the Serbian republic yesterday, we 
have repeatedly displayed our commitment to finalizing the peace 
process. This requires agreement on the part of the Muslims and 
the Croatian side. I hope that the Muslim side will stop 
obstructing and I believe that the international community will 
bring pressure to bear on the Muslim side, if not today then in 
the near future. This is the sole matter to be addressed to 
have a peace agreement signed." 
  According to Bulatovic, head of the Montenegrin state, the 
lifting of sanctions has been included in the mainframe of a 
general agreement. He also said that the situation in the 
country precludes it from staking everything on the 
international community's words and trustworthiness. [passage
