<F P=106> [Report by Novak Vulic: "From Loser to Accomplice"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The merchant navy is in agony! We reported 
this almost eight months ago, yet the spasm and fear of losing 
the fleet is increasingly great. The immense effort of the 
Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidba companies and the state 
to improve the position of the shipping trade with loans 
essentially boils down to buying time. Chances of the fleet 
surviving until the end of the year are realistic only if the 
government decision on a $30 million loan is implemented. In 
addition to the loan, saving the installations that are of 
strategic interest for Montenegro (and therefore, for the 
federal state) also call for the immediate end of the embargo. 
Since chances for a change of policy are slim, there remains 
only a glimmer of hope that perhaps one day at least a part of 
the vessels of the current fleet will sail under our flag. 
  On the eve of the second anniversary of UN Security Council 
Resolution 820, the Montengrin fleet is poorer by four vessels, 
while the threat of a mortgage and auction is looming over the 
bow of the remaining 37. Ships age faster than people, they 
diminish in value, sailing ability, and the ability for equal 
market competition. Debts, on the other hand, like all 
misfortunes, progressively multiply and oppress. It was warned 
long before the first results of the international isolation 
were apparent that a moored boat was the most expensive for its 
owner. It was also warned that a loss of sailors would ensure. 
And that the moorings in the Bar harbor and the docks of the 
Bijela Shipyard were already too quiet, even without boats. In 
the course of last year, the amount of goods that passed through 
the "southern gates of the Balkans" corresponded to the amount 
that in normal circumstances is unloaded in a matter of 15 days. 
For the sake of not completely forgetting work after the 
overhaul of the Sumadija [name of vessel], in Bijela nowadays 
they keep themselves busy with occasional interventions on 
smaller vessels. The majority of employees are on compulsory 
leave. Since there is no way of charging fees for services 
rendered, the shipyard regularly applies for assistance with 
payment of the minimal salaries. All development programs have 
been postponed and are already covered with a thick layer of 
dust. [passage omitted]

<H5>  The Effect of the Sanctions </H5>
  Up until the sanctions, the maritime economy contributed to 
a 
fifth of the foreign currency revenue in the republic. 
  The information on losses accrued under sanctions still 
treats results achieved after surveying the situation at the end 
of October as current. The amount involved is $217 million, but 
only for maritime companies. However, we need at least to add 
to this the $60,000 for daily maintenance of vessels and loans 
from domestic sources, which also need to be repaid. 
  In line with a decision of the Montenegrin and Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia's governments, by the end of October and 
on various bases, the maritime economy was granted almost $15 
million. 
  It is interesting, for example, that former Montenegrin 
companies Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidbva (in the 
meantime they changed their flags, reregistered, and changed 
their mooring port), in addition to calculating losses on 
freight which amounted to almost $100 million, also registered 
and calculated losses incurred by devaluation of property. The 
result can only surprise the uninformed. By the end of October 
1993, it surpassed $35 million. This will rapidly increase, 
because after two years of being moored, vessels are more ruined 
than if they had been in use for five years.
