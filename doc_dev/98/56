  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- A group of 17 
opposition deputies to the Federal Assembly's Chamber of 
Citizens today called on Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic to 
dismiss Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic in connection 
with the withdrawal of accreditation from AFP and CNN. 
  The signatories of this initiative are from the Serbian 
Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party [of Serbia], the Social 
Democratic Party of Montenegro, and the People's Party of 
Montenegro. They maintain that the ban on AFP and CNN causes 
inestimable damage to the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
and its citizens, and ask that this decision be revoked. 
  Explaining their proposal, the deputies say that the FRY is 
in this way coming into direct confrontation with the most 
powerful information media and indirectly with the United States 
and France.
