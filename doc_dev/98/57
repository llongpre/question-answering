   Eight leaders of Montenegro's
government resigned Friday, two days after the central republic's
Communist Party leaders were forced out by growing unrest over the
region's faltering economy.
   It was the first time the entire government and party leaderships
of one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics had stepped down.
   The Montenegrin Parliament on Friday accepted the resignations of
the six-man state presidency but voted to keep it in a caretaker
capacity until new elections were held.
   It also accepted resignations of the republic's representative in
the collective nine-man federal presidency and of its speaker,
Velisav Vuksanovic.
   The state news agency Tanjug reported later that the Parliament
also decided to call early elections in Montenegro. A final decision
on that matter will be made Jan. 26, Tanjug said.
   On Wednesday, the party's central committee formally accepted the
resignation of its ruling Politburo and named a interim leadership
to prepare for an extraordinary party congress.
   Yugoslavia's federal government, six republic governments and two
autonomous provinces each are run by a party presidium, a state
presidency and a government. The presidencies, headed by chairmen,
mostly have formal functions subordinate to the party.
   Montenegro's government, in charge of implementing economic
policies, already resigned after mass protests last October.
   The ouster of the entire Montenegrin ruling elite came after more
than 120,000 people demonstrated earlier this week in Titograd, the
region's capital, demanding the leadership step down because of the
disastrous state of the region's economy.
   ``The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students
and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced
by the country as a whole,'' said Bozidar Tadic, vice-president of
the Montenegrin Parliament, in his keynote speech which was
broadcast live on national television.
   Montenegro's representative on the federal presidency, Veselin
Djuranovic, said his decision to step down ``was motivated by a
sense of responsibility for the economic situation ... and in the
expectation that it will help alleviate the crisis.''
   Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smallest republic and one of its
poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the protracted national
economic crisis, characterized by a 250 percent inflation rate, a
$21 billion foreign debt and 12 percent drop in living standards in
1988 alone.
   The average monthly salary in the republic amounts to the
equivalent of $80, and unemployment has soared after the closing of
several unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized through
federal funds.
