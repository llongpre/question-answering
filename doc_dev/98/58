<F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Zhirinovskiy: There Will Be No </F>
Bombing of Serbian Towns"] 
  [Text] "Do you believe that NATO will indeed attack the 
Serbs from the air?" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was asked today at a 
news conference. 
  "This will not happen. They only want to affect the morale 
of 
the Serbs by threatening them. And if that should happen, there 
is a group of Russian officers in Europe who support me. They 
would use a secret weapon, unused thus far, which destroys any 
force in the air and on the ground, in order to cool off the 
Western heads that threaten attacks on peaceful towns in Bosnia. 
There will be no bombing whatsoever because they know very well 
how Napoleon and Hitler fared, and if they do not know we will 
once again show them," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Asked what he thought about independent Montenegro, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy stated that he believes that there should be two to 
three Orthodox states in the Balkans and that he opposes the 
creation of small states. "The West wants to introduce this in 
the Balkans in order to partition them. Because it wants to 
divide the Balkans: With Catholicism from the west and Turkey in 
the east, and the Germans would arrive from the north, Turkish 
and German would be spoken in the Balkans by the middle of the 
21st century. It will not be able to do so because the Balkans 
are the land of Orthodoxy, where Serbian and Russian will be 
spoken," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy predicts. Speaking about the 
strategy of the West, Zhirinovskiy also said the following: "The 
time will come when the Western politicians will be standing in 
line so that I may receive them." 
  Otherwise, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who came to Montenegro at 
the invitation of the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society, the 
Serbian National Renewal, and the Social Democratic Party of 
Montenegro, also talked this morning with a group of 
representatives of some opposition parties and was received by 
the secretary of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), 
Svetozar Marovic. According to the information issued by 
Marovic's office, the guest was informed of the DPS efforts to 
resolve the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
in a peaceful and democratic way, because the people are tired 
of wars and conflicts. 
  "We must fight for our religion, our spirit, and our mind in 
order to survive in this area. This is why we do this today as 
well, in spite of all the injustices, pressures, and decisions 
of the West. We remember that the Russian people were with us in 
the past, and they are with us today in spite of all the 
tribulations, and we expect to be together in the defense of 
what is ours," Marovic said. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, strongly praising the contribution of 
the DPS in the resolution of the crisis in the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, stressed that "the Russian policy in this 
respect did not always correspond adequately to the expectations 
of the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro," that the policy of his 
party consists of supporting the Slavs and resolving problems 
through peaceful means, and that his party will actively 
participate in the resolution of the crisis and do everything in 
order for the sanctions to be lifted as soon as possible. 
  At exactly 1300 hours in Ivan Milutinovic Square in 
Podgorica, a large assembly was held at which more than 1,000 
citizens were present. Greeted enthusiastically with shouts 
"Russians, Russians" and posters, saying, for example, 
"Priyekhal Petr Velikiy" [Russian for "Peter the Great has 
arrived"], Vladimir Zhirinovskiy addressed the citizens: "We do 
not threaten anyone, but one should know what Russian tanks and 
Russian airplanes are and who was the first to fly into the 
cosmos. Brother Serbs, Montenegrins, be proud to be Orthodox. We 
are both spiritually and economically richer. If they are 
forming the European Gommunity from London to Vienna, we will 
form the Eastern European Community from Knin to Crimea." 
  Offering all possible aid, as he said, to the heroic Serbian 
people, Zhirinovskiy added: "On Saturday, 5 February, I will 
personally organize a meeting in support of the Serbian people, 
and I will ask in the sharpest way in the Russian parliament for 
the resignation of minister-traitor Kozyrev." 
  "Only a short time remains before the leadership in Russia 
is 
removed. We will force it to remove the blockade in Yugoslavia 
and find a way to compensate the Serbs for the material losses 
they have suffered. We are obligated to take care of you more 
than anyone else. Let the war move on to Latin America, Africa, 
and the Far East," Zhirinovskiy said, among other things, at 
today's meeting in Podgorica, which was in a way spontaneous, 
because it was announced only late last night.
