  [Text] If Montenegro secedes from Serbia, the Convention of 
Boka is determined to start the process of unification with the 
other Serbian lands. This would be done first with Herzegovina 
and therefore with Serbia, and would provide Serbia with access 
to the sea. This would in fact represent the reassessment of 
the decision on the unification of Boka with Montenegro. 
  These are the first words of the Declaration of the Boka 
Convention, which was distributed to the media yesterday, 
bearing the signature of Convention chairman Slobodan Panovic. 
The Convention demands that the ruling party, the Democratic 
Party of Socialists, put a stop to separatist forces -- as the 
declaration says -- first in their own ranks. 
  Serbian Boka will follow and cooperate with the conventions 
of Vasojevici, Zeta, old [Stara] Herzegovina, and the Raska 
region [Sandzak] on the achievement of the Serbian national 
program. We demand that the Montenegrin bodies inaugurate 26 
November 1918 as a public holiday, the date of the unification 
of Serbia and Montenegro. The Boka Convention demands a change 
in the attitude of the Republic of Montenegro toward this region.
