   Communist authorities put more
police on the streets and imposed unspecified ``urgent measures''
in Montenegro's capital Monday, but protests kept up, fed by
economic crisis and ethnic tension.
   Protest has swept much of southern and eastern Yugoslavia in
recent weeks. Police used violent tactics for the first time over
the weekend to disperse Montenegrin students and workers demanding
dismissal of local Communist Party leaders.
   Several Yugoslavs reported that civil defense units in Belgrade
were put on a higher level of alert Saturday. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No sign of trouble surfaced in Belgrade.
   President Raif Dizdarevic appealed for calm on national
television Sunday night, warning of unspecified emergency measures.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and Communist Party
structure.
   Unrest persisted Monday in Titograd, the capital of Montenegro
280 miles southwest of Belgrade, and the regional party leadership
held an emergency meeting, the official news agency Tanjug reported.
   About 15,000 people at Niksic, 30 miles north of Titograd,
joined 2,800 striking steelworkers Monday for a street rally,
Tanjug said. Twelve demonstrators were detained there Sunday night.
   Police used clubs and tear gas to break up weekend crowds in
Titograd and to disperse marchers in Niksic who were on their way
to Titograd.
   The Titograd rally was an explosion of anger over hardships
resulting from the austerity program imposed by the government in
May because of a $21 billion foreign debt and an annual inflation
rate of 217 percent. The unemployment rate is about 15 percent.
   Concern for Montenegrins in southern Serbia's troubled Kosovo
province also has stirred passions. Serbs and Montenegrins in
Kosovo, most of them Christians, are a minority to the mainly
Moslem ethnic Albanian population.
   Tanjug reported, without details, that ``urgent measures'' were
imposed Monday in Titograd. It said later 1,000 construction
workers called off a strike after local party leaders promised to
consider their demands.
   An official reached at the government information office in
Titograd reported more police patrols in some parts of the city and
said civilian defense units were told ``to display special
vigilance and prevent any repetition of the unrest of the past
weekend.''
   He said steps would be taken to ease shortages of meat, bread
and cooking oil.
   In Belgrade, the federal government said it was rescinding a
28.5 percent increase in electricity prices announced Oct. 1.
   Workers in Titograd blame local party leaders for the economic
troubles and demand they be dismissed.
   The party leadership in Vojvodina, an autonomous province of
Serbia, was dismissed last week after a similar public outcry.
   Protesters in Niksic demanded Monday that Montenegro's police
chief be fired because of the weekend violence, dramatizing their
point by hoisting a man wearing a gas mask on the shoulders of the
crowd, Tanjug reported.
   ``We are not demanding the gallows for those who ordered the
beating up of our comrades, we are only demanding their sacking,''
the agency quoted worker Miloslav Michunovich as saying.
   Monday's rallies in Montenegro were largely the work of those
who support Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Communist Party leader
who is popular among Serbs and Montenegrins for his defense of
their fellow Slavs in Kosovo.
   Two of Yugoslavia's six republics _ Slovenia and Bosnia
Herzegovina _ issued statements supporting Dizdarevic's
denunciation of nationalist protests.
   But the leadership in Serbia defended its drive for more control
of its two provinces, which are nominally autonomous.
   That indicated a showdown between rival politicians and
republics at a key meeting set for Oct. 17 to decide changes in the
national Communist Party leadership.
   Stern response to protests could work against Milosevic, who
opponents fear will ride the wave of ethnic emotion to greater
national power.
