  [Text] London, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) is vitally interested in an immediate end of 
war in its neighbourhood and will support every solution that 
might be freely agreed upon by the nations of former Yugoslavia, 
Serbian Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic and Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic told British members of Parliament on 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The Serbian and Montenegrin officials were conferring in 
London with members of the British-Yugoslav parliamentary group 
which comprises representatives of all British parliamentary 
parties. 
  The international community must support political talks and 
not war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Tomic and explained that 
Yugoslavia upholds the latest European plan for [word 
indistinct] wracked Bosnia, as it provides for a countrywide 
cessation of hostilities as a precondition for a political 
settlement. 
  The world must, however, exercise its influence primarily 
with the Moslem side which is obviously seeking ways to prolong 
the war, said Tomic. 
  He informed the group that the U.N. Security Council's 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed because of the country's 
alleged involvement in the Bosnian war, have cost the country 
$45 billion and are a threat to the region as a whole. 
  Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanoviv said that with the 
sanctions, the world is punishing only those who wished to 
protect their country. The sanctions are impermissible also 
because they are based on the policy of force and threats, which 
cannot be the foundation on which to build the new world order, 
he said. 
  He explained that the sanctions are being implemented more 
strictly than the United Nations intended, and in illustration 
mentioned the problem of importing medicines, which are supposed 
to be exempt from the sanctions. 
  Djukanovic said it is paradoxical that Yugoslavia is being 
ignored by the world at a time when very powerful democratic 
processes, deeper than ever before, are under way in the country. 
  Tomic and Djukanovic condemned war crimes and those who have 
committed them. [words indistinct] vowed Tomic. 
  The hosts agreed with the Yugoslav officials that there is 
still no readiness in the world to help create the conditions 
for lasting peace by according equal treatment to all warring 
sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
