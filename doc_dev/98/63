<F P=106> [Interview with Sulejman Ugljanin, chairman of the Muslim </F>
National Council for Sandzak, by Amir Hodzic; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Ugljanin, due to the communications 
blockade and other blockades in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we are not 
in a position to found out more about the real state of affairs 
in Sandzak. This is a chance to find out from you about what is 
really going on there. 
  [Ugljanin] The situation in Sandzak is identical to that in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina before the war. There are mass arrests of 
Muslims, Muslim houses are searched, criminal charges are 
brought against them. Generally, this is a form of a refined 
state terror. It is nothing new, since with the start of the 
war, that is, the Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a campaign of terror was launched 
simultaneously against the Muslims in Sandzak. 
  You know that since the start of the aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina some 74,000 Muslims, women and children, 
adults who were expelled from Bosnia have passed through 
Sandzak. Some stayed a month, some two months, some stayed a 
year, and there are still some 16,000 of them there in Sandzak 
in our homes, who live with us. Apart from everything that 
happened to them [changes thought] their fears are doubled 
because they have experienced something terrible and now they 
are expecting even worse to come. 
  Serbia and Montenegro, you know, planned the ethnic 
cleansing 
of Muslim and Croatian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic 
cleansing of the Muslim people of Sandzak, and the ethnic 
cleansing of the Albanian people of Kosovo. They are doing just 
that now. It is obvious. Now it is up to us to prevent that 
and have our status justly resolved. You might have heard, the 
whole world knows, that we as the national council called on the 
people to boycott the elections because of the 
Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on Bosnia- Herzegovina, and not 
one of our people voted in the Serbian and Montenegrin elections 
on 31 May 1992 or 20 December 1992, and the third time [words 
indistinct] that we do not have to participate in elections in 
the country that has attacked our mother state 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people completely boycotted the 
elections for the third time on 19 December 1993. After that, 
when Serbian-Montenegrin authorities realized that the people 
are united and determined, that they are nationally aware -- the 
people stuck by the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] -- then the 
police was sent by the politically defeated Serbia and 
Montenegro, and -- you must have heard -- the entire political 
leadership of the SDA was arrested. Hamo Hadzic, SDA chairman 
for Montenegro, was arrested, so was Rasim [words indistinct]; 
the entire leadership was arrested between 25 to 31 January this 
year. 
  We have been publishing the statements of the lawyers who 
defend them -- a group of Montenegrin lawyers is defending them 
-- and the statements issued by the lawyers, the statements 
about the arrests given by our people in those prisons: that is 
a tragedy -- one can barely comprehend how a man can be such an 
animal toward another man. In this case, it has gone even 
beyond inhumanity. The attitude of the Serbian and Montenegrin 
authorities toward the Muslims in Sandzak is identical to the 
attitude in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only difference is that we 
do not have the shelling.
