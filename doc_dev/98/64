<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Serbian Radical Party of </F>
Montenegro -- `Real Leaders of the Serbian People Think 
Differently'"] 
  [Text] "We harshly condemn the unmeasured statement by FRY 
President Lilic. It is clear to everybody who has read the text 
that the leader mentioned there must be in the Srpska republic 
as it is at war," it is said in the statement by the Serbian 
Radical Party of Montenegro. 
  ``Is it possible that the Yugoslav president does not know 
the reasons for the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
reasons for not ending the war and for not establishing peace? 
He clumsily expressed his annoyance, as well as the annoyance 
of millions of Yugoslavs, with the fact that the civil war in 
Bosnia, because of which people are still being killed and 
suffering, is still going on. 
  ``When it is known what the world wants from the Serbs in 
general and particularly from those in the Srpska republic, it 
is particularly inappropriate that the head of the Yugoslav 
federation directly accuses heroic Serbian leaders, saying that 
the war continues due their leadership ambitions. An insult to 
them is also an insult to the suffering and decimated people of 
the Srpska republic. 
  "Serbian leaders can immediately decide to end the war, 
albeit to do so means accepting the blackmail and giving 
Bosnia-Herzegovina over to Alija Izetbegovic. The sanctions on 
Yugoslavia would then be lifted, but the Serbian people would 
also end the centuries-old dream of a joint state, which has 
already been created. However, the Serbian people would also be 
left without respect and dignity, and the future generations of 
Serbs would be ashamed of our generation for deciding on a road 
of humiliation out of selfishness. We hope that this was only a 
momentary weakness of Mr. Lilic's and that the real leaders of 
the Serbian people think differently," the Montenegrin Radicals 
point out.
