<F P=106> [Article by Slobodan Rackovic: "All of Sandzak Stands </F>
Accused"] 
  [Text] The prisons in Sandzak could get overcrowded, for 
the Montenegrin-Serb police are very eager to arrest all 
"suspicious Muslims," regardless of which party they belong to, 
although, at the very beginning, the action to "preserve the 
territorial integrity of the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia]" was directed exclusively at the SDA [Party of 
Democratic Action] or, to be more precise, toward its 
leadership. (The Montenegrin MUP [Ministry of Interior] 
reported several days ago that they had arrested the 13th 
"Muslim extremist" -- another four are still at large -- but did 
not say which party he belongs to.) Practically every Muslim is 
a suspect here in Sandzak and some municipal assemblies, such as 
that of Bijelo Polje and Berani, publicly gave the police "the 
green light" to continue hunting them down. It is no longer a 
secret that they are after all the Muslims, who have suddenly 
also lost the right to their nationality (in their reports, the 
MUP of Montenegro refers to them as people "of Muslim religion," 
ignoring their nationality!), for they allegedly did not 
disassociate themselves from "those who want to break up 
Yugoslavia." Radonja Zekovic, the famous Serbian chauvinist and 
member of the militant National Party, uttered the following 
threat to all Muslims at the session of the Bijelo Polje 
Municipal Assembly: "The only thing you do is to demand rights 
and you do not fulfill your obligations to your native country, 
with which there is no bargaining." His words met with wide 
approval of committee members of the ruling DPS [Democratic 
Party of Socialists], who say they are a civic party. 
Naturally, in that tub-thumping atmosphere, which has nothing 
to do with parliamentarianism, the proposal to ban the SDA, as 
well as the Liberal Union and the Social Democratic Party, was 
accepted with loud cheers. The same scenario was realized even 
more easily in Berani, which was a well-known Greater-Serbian 
chetnik stronghold during World War II. 
  The Muslims will, therefore, continue to be persecuted 
wherever they are and it would not be surprising if "honest 
Muslims," who (out of fear or naivete) are now hiding in the 
ruling DPS, will be treated in the same way. If it is any 
consolation to them, it will not be much easier for those who 
associate with them either, whether in parties or privately, 
those who are, as a rule, authentic Montenegrins who do not 
admit to be "of Serbian origin" at all and advocate an 
independent state for Montenegro. It is precisely those people 
and professionals like Vladan Djuranovic, Ranko Vukotic, Vesna 
Rajcevic, and Velibor Markovic, as well as Velija Muric and Agil 
Nasufovic, who have engaged in futile efforts to represent the 
13 arrested Muslims from Pljevlje, Bijelo Polje, Rozaj, Berani, 
and Petnjica, who are now in prison (almost all of them since 26 
January this year) and the four others who are on the run, all 
accused of "breaking up Yugoslavia." However, they are almost 
helpless and, in a month of pretrial detention, which has now 
been illegally extended, they saw their clients once for half an 
hour while the latter did not manage to see their families at 
all. 
  Defense attorney Ranko Vukotic said the following: "This is 
an unprecedented violation of all the defense rights in the 
legal system since the time of Cominform. The television 
spectacle in which the suspects presented hidden weapons was 
arranged specially for that occasion, and was carefully aimed at 
preparing the public. Every voice that demands that the 
Constitution be respected, is, regarding this case, treated as 
belonging to traitors or to the enemy." His colleague Velija 
Muric claims that human rights were not denied in this way even 
to the most notorious war criminals. Both attorneys point out 
that it is now most important to end this unconstitutional 
investigation that which denies the accused's rights to have 
defense attorneys and that defendants should be given a public 
trial. 
  The situation is the same in Novi Pazar, where a trial of 
25 Muslims, most of them SDA activists, is under way; they are 
accused of the same "crime" -- "having weapons and breaking up 
Yugoslavia." Those people, most of them from Novi Pazar, have 
already endured the worst -- beating and police pressure in 
pretrial detention. Owing to the lack of evidence, the trial, 
which has unprecedented security measures, is very sloppy: It 
is often interrupted, and the accused deny everything that they 
admitted during the pretrial investigation, claiming that they 
did so under duress. 
  "The investigation was a scandal and a travesty of justice 
as 
it was arranged to make the our defendants look guilty. This is 
a purely political process," says a well-known Belgrade 
attorney, Rajko Danilovic, and attorney Azem Vllasi agrees with 
him and is optimistic about the outcome of the trial. 
  "It is good that the trial was open to the public, so the 
domestic and international public will be able to find out what 
this is all about. People who sympathize with the accused know 
the truth, but the authorities, which want this trial, are 
creating more tension and distrust, although that is another 
unpleasant factor for them," says Vllasi. 
  However, with regard to the domestic public, it seems that 
Mr. Vllasi has no good reason for his optimism. Admission to 
the court house in Novi Pazar (and it will be like this in 
Bijelo Polje too) can only be gained by regime journalists of 
Podgorica and Belgrade's state media, who have already passed 
judgment on the accused. We know how the international public 
will, on the other hand, find out something more about the 
motives and goals of those trials through its journalists, who 
are hard to find indeed, and through diplomats in Belgrade who 
are following the trial in Novi Pazar and will certainly be 
following the one in Bijelo Polje as well, which is bound to 
have higher ratings because of the higher "ranks" of the 
arrested SDA leaders. 
  The Yugoslav authorities will, no doubt, realize their goal 
-- they will definitely destroy the SDA in Sandzak as they have 
all the state instruments necessary to do so. It will be the 
first time since 1946 that a legitimate and legally registered 
party is banned in Yugoslavia, this time significantly broken 
up, which shows that there is actually a quasi-pluralism in the 
deeds of the Montenegrin-Serbian federation, just as there was 
right after World War II.
