<F P=106> [B.I.M. report: "Revision of Osimo Agreement"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Podgorica -- At yesterday's news conference Dr. 
Novak Kilibarda, president of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro, 
upheld the demands of individual political parties in Italy for 
the revision of the Osimo Agreement. Kilibarda said that "one 
needs to compensate the Italian citizens who used to live in 
Dalmatia and had their possessions there" especially "because 
they did not work on the side of the occupier but were loyal to 
the Yugoslav authorities." 
  The president of the most numerous Montenegrin opposition 
party emphasized that the sympathizers and members of his party 
"will not defend Dalmatia from the Italians," and that they 
would rather see "the Italians living in Split and Dubrovnik 
than the Croats." [passage omitted]
