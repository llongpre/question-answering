  [Text] Tirana, March 12 (ATA) -- "Montenegro militiamen 
were too hard on us. They kept us for 68 hours in a cell deep 
under the ground without electricity, in the middle of urine, on 
a cement floor, without food and blankets. We have been beaten 
with batons," said the socialist deputy Moikom Zeqo in a 
statement made yesterday to Albanian TV. 
  The deputy Zeqo and the chairman of the Party of the 
National 
Unity, Mr. Idajet Beqiri, were arrested two days earlier in 
Montenegro accused of illegal entry into the country. The 
accused have denied the charge. After a staged trial in 
Montenegro, the two Albanians were sentenced to twenty days in 
prison, which was reduced to ten days upon appeal. 
  Mr. Zeqo has addressed a protest against the acts of 
Montenegro police to the European Parliament, President Clinton, 
and the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania.
