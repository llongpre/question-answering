<F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, leader of the Liberal </F>
Association of Montenegro, by Slobodan Rackovic; place and date 
not given: "Montenegro Is Occupied!"] 
  [Text] Slavko Perovic -- founder and leader of the Liberal 
Association of Montenegro [LSCG], 38-year-old lawyer from 
Cetinje, 100 percent Montenegrin, one of the most frequently 
denounced politicians in former Yugoslavia, robust and 
courageous as a lion, eloquent as Demosthenes -- is a man whom 
you do not have to like or agree with, but you have to respect 
him. The same is maintained by many of his political opponents, 
even enemies, who breathlessly listen to his debates in the 
Montenegrin Assembly and other state bodies. Journalists flock 
to his news conferences, while those who dare not do that are 
most happy to have the opportunity of interviewing him.... This 
is the first time he has given an interview to DANAS, which, to 
his regret, is not on sale in Montenegro, but he manages to get 
hold of a copy through Slovenia from time to time. 
  [Rackovic] What is the argument the LSCG uses to justify the 
attitude that the LSCG is the strongest opposition party in the 
republic? The pro-Serbian National Party in the Montenegrin 
Assembly holds one seat more than your party (the liberals have 
12 out of 85 seats). 
  [Perovic] We have 20,000 registered members, an enviable 
figure for a state with 630,000 inhabitants, and some 400,000 
voters. Our membership is still growing, and that is a rather 
puzzling fact for us. Besides, at the latest undemocratic 
elections in December 1992, the ruling Democratic Party of 
Socialists [DPS] literally arranged the votes in the way that 
best suited it -- 16 percent of votes to us, 17 percent of votes 
to the National Party -- in order to build its central position 
on the unprecedented grounds -- on the national [word 
illegible]. The LSCG now holds 26 to 30 percent of the 
Montenegrin political market, which is an extraordinary 
advancement. Besides, I remind you that in Montenegro it is 
only our party's members who have been facing the street 
barricades, it is only our rallies that have been undermined. 
The police and the press have been paying most attention to our 
party, which clearly speaks for our objective strength, rather 
than the advantage in the Montenegrin Assembly. However, if it 
comes to the extraordinary elections, like those that happened 
in Serbia, we do not expect a victory of the Montenegrin bloc. 
The DPS still has its secret police, spies, the media... 
through which it can easily control public opinion. However, 
the next time the DPS will have to agree to give more number 
seats in the Assembly to the LSCG, so that no government can be 
formed without the liberals. 
  We would not go for forming any coalitions in the elections, 
we simply want to contribute to the stratification of the 
so-called Montenegrin opposition bloc. All of us who belong to 
that bloc see Montenegro as a Mediterranean, European country, 
as an open society with unlimited private ownership, which is to 
say, we see it as a modern, liberal capitalist country. Our 
allies in the Assembly -- the Social Democratic Party of 
Montenegro -- vary in their orientations, ranging from the model 
of confederation up to the model of sovereign Montenegro with 
the social-democratic system, by which they are hopelessly 
trying to manipulate the feelings of the Montenegrin citizens, 
who are still pining for the former, socialist Yugoslavia, not 
realizing that the former Yugoslav leadership actually planned 
and brought about the bloody disintegration of the union of the 
south Slavs. 
  [Rackovic] If you attain power, what will be your attitude 
toward the former Yugoslav republics? 
  [Perovic] We will recognize all the states that have 
developed from the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia], within their AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of 
National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders. The principle of 
the unchangeability of borders is undisputable for us, and if 
that principle happens to be annulled, the region of former 
Yugoslavia will be open for war and catastrophe. As for the 
reintegration of Yugoslavia in terms of as it used to be, we do 
not even think about that, because we think it is hypocritical 
even to use that word. Simply, former Yugoslavia cannot be 
restored upon hundreds of thousands of graves. We think that 
each former Yugoslav state should be recognized, international 
recognition should be made possible for them, and we should 
leave it to time and the will of each of those states to decide 
whether they will go for the reintegration following their 
interests, or not. I would like to stress once more that I 
refer to the reintegration in terms of joint interests, rather 
than reintegration into a joint state. 
  [Rackovic] Belgrade simply does not allow Montenegro to 
cooperate with Croatia, Italy, and Albania. Some incidents have 
even been fabricated, like the one near Debeli Brijeg, by the 
border with Croatia. 
  [Perovic] Well, it is well-known that Montenegro is an 
occupied state in which there are 60,000 Serbian soldiers, while 
the lovely Montenegrin coast has been the place with the 
greatest concentration of naval forces and equipment.... Which 
is to say, we have been definitely under occupation. However, 
within that occupying force there is a lot of people who in 
their hearts support the policy of the LSCG. That trend in the 
Yugoslav Army is still active. That is not so great a surprise, 
because it is obvious that the entire state mechanism is falling 
apart, that is, a metastasis of the idea of the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. Nobody can halt that process, not even 
Slobodan Milosevic, and his tanks and aircraft. In the entire 
situation Montenegro has a great chance to accomplish its 
historic goal in a peaceful way -- the independence that 
Montenegro enjoyed for centuries. 
  [Rackovic] Jevrem Brkovic [Montenegrin poet, opponent of the 
Montenegrin regime] claims that Montenegro cannot accomplish 
that goal without bloodshed. 
  [Perovic] Using the opportunity to express my sincere 
regards to my friend Brkovic, I pray to God that he is not 
right. I think that weapons should be put aside. We must not 
allow bloodshed in Montenegro, because in the first place it 
would be directed against the interest of the Montenegrin 
people, regardless of who would eventually win. That victory 
would do to us much more harm than good, so we are doing 
everything we can to convince our members and supporters that 
the way to the sovereign and independent state of Montenegro 
leads only through a referendum. We are absolutely convinced of 
our success. 
  [Rackovic] Belgrade, however, is constantly putting pressure 
on Montenegro by inciting the chauvinist Serb circles in Boka, 
Zeta, and Vasojevici, which reminds one very much of the prewar 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Perovic] In Montenegro there are no such tensions as were 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The great Serbian design has been 
politically defeated in Montenegro. Simply, it takes time for 
that defeat to reflect itself among the people. It is precisely 
those pitiful rallies in Boka, Zeta, and Vasojevici, having 
amassed a miserable number of troublemakers, that best speak for 
my being right. These are desperate moves, a consequence of the 
fact that the supporters of the great Serbian policy are losing 
their hold on Montenegro. Those rallies are organized by people 
whom the locals call Montenegrins from Terazije [a district of 
Belgrade]. Those are Belgrade's hirelings, and the interest of 
Belgrade is much more important for them than their own interest. 
  [Rackovic] Your old theory is: Not an inch more of 
Montenegro, not an inch less. 
  [Perovic] That is right. We accept Montenegro within the 
existing borders, with which we are completely satisfied. For 
us the issue of Prevlaka has never been a problem. It is a 
fictitious problem that was supposed to justify the shameful 
raid on Dubrovnik. The issue of our borders with Croatia can be 
settled only through negotiations between the sovereign states 
of Croatia and Montenegro, provided, of course, that both states 
are interested in that. As early as at the beginning of the war 
in Dubrovnik, a delegation of the Croatian Parliament came to 
Podgorica, and proposed the settlement of the Prevlaka issue 
through bilateral talks, but the Montenegrin officials, being 
Milosevic's marionette, went for the option that was supposed to 
settle some mythical relations of theirs, rather than some real 
Montenegrin relations, because of which Montenegro is still in 
such a difficult position. I repeat, the issue of Prevlaka was 
invented as a justification of the great Serbian territorial 
claims. However, that does not justify those Montenegrins who 
set so many houses on fire in the region, and killed the people 
there. Behind every single crime there stands a concrete 
person. And one day they will have to take the consequences for 
what they did. For a long time Montenegro will be paying for 
its thoughtlessness, for its having attacked Dubrovnik and its 
people, who were our friends for centuries. When the 
Montenegrin borders were proclaimed administrative, we protested 
against that, because we understood that is the introduction to 
a war. We did not manage to influence the course of events, but 
we still did a lot to make the Montenegrin citizens understand 
in time what a ploy it all was, and to diminish in this way the 
immense tragedy of Dubrovnik. 
  [Perovic] We are now making efforts to improve relations 
with Croatia, and to make the border crossing at Debeli Brijeg 
completely open, which also applies to all the border crossings 
to the neighboring countries. Being occupied in such a way, 
fettered, driven into this quasi-state, we have no chance. We 
have to find a way to apologize to Dubrovnik and Croatia for 
what we did there. After all, even before the war started we 
had established excellent relations with the Croatian 
Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], then with the Slovene liberals, 
with the Muslim Bosniak Organization and the liberals led by 
Rasim Kadic in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the liberals led by 
Stojan Andov in Macedonia, and in Serbia with the parties of 
Nenad Canko, Vesna Pesic, while we still cooperate with Vuk 
Draskovic, regardless of his nationalism.... Despite the war, 
we have managed to maintain those relations, to my great 
pleasure, while with Drazen Budisa's HSLS we have even managed 
to improve those relations. 
  [Rackovic] You do not recognize the FRY, and you call it the 
so-called FRY. 
  [Perovic] I feel about the FRY that it is a result of a 
great deceit, and war-mongering policy. From the point of view 
of law and politics, it is a farce, which is best shown by the 
fact that even last year we celebrated the Day of the Republic 
on 29 November [the day when AVNOJ Yugoslavia was established in 
the Bosnian town of Jajce], a holiday of the republic that does 
not exist any more! Jajce is not to be found in that state any 
more, it is devastated and burnt down. That is an example of 
hypocrisy unprecedented in the history of mankind. The 
authorities in Montenegro announced a referendum (which was 
boycotted by the democratic opposition), at which the citizens 
had to state their opinion about the future of their fatherland. 
Let me not remind of the fact that only seven days passed from 
the day when the decision on the referendum was made, to the day 
when the referendum eventually took place. The question was so 
ambiguously formulated that the government could not but win. 
Or, for instance, one man voted for entire families, or even 
for his entire village. It was an incredible farce, so today 
many people come up to me and apologize for having voted for the 
federation of Montenegro with Serbia, that is, for the FRY. 
  We do not want to live in that state, because when we look 
at 
Belgrade, we understand that Serbia is politically contaminated, 
that it will take decades for it to be politically 
decontaminated. For a long time it will be impossible to 
establish Serbia as a lawful, democratic state with a European 
orientation. We want to leave the union, because Montenegro 
still has a considerable chance to get away, and to win 
international support. Of course, we do not demand the life of 
a single soldier for Montenegro, we do not demand intervention 
by either NATO or anyone else. We also do not want our people 
to get killed for Montenegro, but we have to clearly express our 
political will, and to bring Milosevic to a halt: either he will 
send tanks to kill us, or he will eliminate the most 
distinguished Montenegrins with the help of his secret police. 
Yet, tyranny will solve nothing here, and I am happy to assess 
that the movement for independent Montenegro has grown so strong 
and huge that nobody can halt it any more. The situation is 
exactly the opposite: The greater the pressure that Belgrade 
puts on us, the stronger the people's awareness of the need for 
the Montenegrin state to become independent. 
  We are proposing to the authorities that they examine public 
opinion now, precisely two years after the referendum, but they 
persistently refuse to do that, fabricating with the help of the 
media a monstrous lie that, in the case of the liberals' 
victory, a civil war will break out. We say that there will be 
no war, because for a war two parties are needed, whereas for 
carnage a single one will do.
