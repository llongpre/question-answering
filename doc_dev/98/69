    [Editorial Report] A leading Belgrade economic weekly has 
predicted that it will be difficult for the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (FRY) to sustain the record level of energy 
production reached in the past two years. An article in the 11 
April issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA said that the "achievements" 
of the past two years will be difficult to repeat even though 
the FRY has assigned the highest priority to energy production. 
<H5>  Assessments of 1993 </H5>
  Maintaining such a high level would be a very tall order for 
the economically impoverished energy producers, which incurred 
huge losses in 1993 as a result of inflation and the 
government's price policy, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA analysts reported 
in the journal's 25 April issue. Oil companies lost tens of 
billions of dinars, with the exception of Beopetrol, formerly a 
branch of the Croatian oil company INA, which, besides earning 
243 billion dinars from the sale of oil derivatives, made a 
profit of 2.6 trillion dinars from financial transactions in 
1993. 
  Analyzing the performance of the Serbian electric power 
industry, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA assessed 1993 as "the most 
difficult period" for the Republic's power companies "since 
electricity first arrived in Serbia," with losses amounting to 
884 million German marks (DM). When domestic and foreign debt, 
depreciation, "and so on" are added, the losses approach DM2 
billion. EKONOMSKA POLITIKA blamed the government policy of low 
energy prices for this "dismal" result, explaining that "sales 
contributed only 1.56 percent of total revenue, with everything 
else coming from the consumption of raw materials and capital." 
Therefore, the weekly maintained, companies lacked funds for 
spare parts and maintenance, resulting in frequent malfunctions, 
outages, reduced productivity, and safety violations. 
Electricity production, for example, declined from a record 
high 37 billion kwh in 1989 to 30 billion kwh last year. It 
should be noted, said the weekly, that during this period the 
structure of consumption changed, with industrial usage 
declining 48 percent while household use rose by almost 50 
percent. 
<H5>  Seasonal Demand </H5>
  Another problem mentioned by EKONOMSKA POLITIKA was the 
seasonal fluctuation in energy demand, which ranges from an 
average daily consumption of 60 million kwh during the warmer 
months to a surge of 130 million kwh in the peak winter season 
when electricity, as the cheapest source of energy, is used for 
heating. At present price levels, the electric industry will 
experience additional losses and be unable to "repeat the 
success of the last year" in satisfying high consumer demand. 
While the government works on a new, more rational pricing 
structure and the reorganization of the energy sector, EKONOMSKA 
POLITIKA warns, a "crisis" looms. 
<H5>  Diesel Fuel Shortage </H5>
  A shortage of D-2 diesel fuel has already affected spring 
sowing, reported the same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, citing 
figures from a study conducted by the Yugoslav Chamber of 
Commerce. According to the study, the agricultural sector needs 
105,000 tons of fuel for the March to June period -- 25,400 tons 
of that total in March and 40,000 tons in April. In March, 
however, domestic oil producers delivered only 5,400 tons. 
Between 1 January and 21 March, the government imported 13,000 
tons of the fuel. Taking into account existing fuel reserves 
estimated to amount to 15,000 tons, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA concluded 
that the agriculture sector is short 71,600 tons of D-2 diesel 
fuel for the first half of 1994, with only 32 percent of its 
requirements covered. Therefore, the sector will have to receive 
increased allocations from domestic suppliers and from imports. 
<H5>  Fuel Supplies </H5>
  The same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA dismissed reports that 
Serbian firms were testing so-called "eko-mer," a new, 
environmentally friendly fuel "made from domestic agricultural 
raw materials employing domestic technology," as "nice 
news...which unfortunately will not solve our problem." It also 
reported that the Pancevo oil refinery and the Belgrade firm 
Jugopetrol had decided to stop producing and selling 98-octane 
premium gasoline because they cannot import the additives needed 
to produce it. Beginning 11 April, the refinery was to produce 
only 95-octane gasoline containing 0.4 percent lead. 
<H5>  Serbia-Montenegro Discord </H5>
  The shortage of oil has had an impact on relations between 
Serbia and Montenegro, according to the 29 April issue of the 
Belgrade daily POLITIKA. Montenegro is demanding that oil 
produced in Serbia be sold not only in Serbia but also in 
Montenegro, which is otherwise entirely dependent on imports. 
POLITIKA reported that Montenegro needs 300 tons of gasoline 
and 1,800 tons of diesel fuel per month to satisfy the demands 
of its priority consumers: hospitals, schools, health centers, 
the police, and farmers. The Federal Crisis Center has proposed 
that Montenegro receive 6 to 7 percent of the total oil supply 
-- too much, judging by Serbian reactions, and too little, 
according to Montenegrin demands, the paper reported. 
  POLITIKA believes, however, that Serbian and Montenegrin 
leaders will conclude an agreement and that Montenegro will be 
receiving Serbian oil derivatives by June. In return, the paper 
noted, Montenegro will be expected to invest some of its tourism 
income in oil production in Serbia's Vojvodina Province, because 
Montenegro cannot "seriously make claims on the federation and 
at the same time ignore its obligations to the federation." 
POLITIKA contrasted the discord over the oil supply to the 
"exemplary" cooperation between the Serbian and Montenegrin 
electric power companies, which function as an integrated 
electric-energy system.
