  [Text] Podgorica, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Montenegro 
Government submitted a written notice today to the republic's 
assembly to the effect that, following the adoption of a federal 
law on defense, there is no longer any need for Prime Minister 
Milo Djukanovic to perform the duty of minister for defense. 
  When the Montenegrin Government was being formed in March 
last year, it decided that the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, 
would perform the duty of minister for defense until a federal 
law on defense was passed which, the government explained, would 
specify constitutional arrangements in this sphere and create 
conditions for a uniform discharge of this duty at federal level. 
  Given that the Montenegro Ministry for Defense has been 
dissolved following the adoption of the federal law in this 
sphere, the government suggests that the republic's assembly 
should relieve Deputy Defense Minister Veljko Vukovic of his 
duty.
