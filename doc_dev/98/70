  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- As reported financial 
police has discovered cases of contraband fuels to Montenegro 
through Shkodra Lake. Recently the police detected cases of 
smuggling fuels into Montenegro through Buna River flowing from 
Shkodra Lake into the Adriatic. Major Muhamet Gradeci, head of 
Shkodra Financial Police, told ATA that the police in 
cooperation with police of order, discovered December 21, 1993 
in the coastal village of Pulaj near Buna, 30 kilometers from 
Shkodra, pipes which were used for smuggling fuels from Albania 
into Montenegro. The pipes were some 20 meters long and 
connected the coasts of Buna. 
  The pipe line is larger than the one discovered a month ago 
almost in the same place, Major Gradeci said and added that the 
other pipe line was some 10 centimeters broader and operated 
through pumps which carried fuels from tankers into Montenegro. 
Mr. Gradeci said he had suspicion that other pipes might exist 
in other areas of Buna River and added that financial police has 
been working to discover them. 
  The pipe lines have been installed by peasants of nearby 
zone 
who transport fuels which is provided to them by smugglers. The 
pipes were destroyed right after they were discovered but this 
was done only in the Albanian territory. 
  Smuggling with fuels is result of cooperation among Albanian 
and Montenegrin smugglers. Financial police is working to cut 
the threads of fuels smuggling. 
  A private fuels station in Velipoja, near Buna River flow, 
has been a good shelter for smugglers for a long time. 
Financial police has already blocked the station and every 
tanker which passes this way is suspicious of smuggling. Mr. 
Gradeci explained that 50 per cent of condraband fuels is 
carried out through the fuels station in Velipoja. 
  Attempts to smuggle with fuels increased especially by the 
end of last year and the beginning of the new year. Financial 
police and that of public order blocked December 30 evening 11 
tankers loaded with oil and the amount of fuels was not usual. 
After verification of documents the police controlled the 
destination the fuels were headed to. 
  On January 4, 1994, the police took possession of lorries 
and 
cars carrying 130 barrels of fuels. Half of the barrels carried 
kerosene which is not allowed to be transported by citizens but 
only through vehicles having the authorization of the government.
