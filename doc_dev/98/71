   Several thousand striking workers and
university students demonstrated today in Montenegro's provincial
capital, Titograd, to demand the ouster of local communist leaders,
Tanjug state news agency said.
   About 10,000 demonstrators gave the entire Communist Party
leadership of southern Montenegro ``a two-hour ultimatum'' to
resign, ``or they will break into the republic's parliament building
by force,'' state television reported. Police violently broke up a
similar Titograd protest in October.
   Tanjug said flag-waving protesters ``in a crowd which was
constantly growing'' gathered this morning in front of Montenegro's
Parliament building chanting ``We want resignations!'' and ``The
people are hungry!''
   They also demanded Montenegrin leaders take responsibility for
police force used to halt Oct. 7-8 demonstrations.
   ``Who dares to beat the workers!'' Tanjug said the crowd chanted.
   Police injured at least 10 people when they fired tear gas and
wielded rubber truncheons to disperse crowds in the October
disturbance. It triggered one of the worst political crises in
postwar Yugoslavia.
   Yugoslavia is facing its worse social and economic crisis in
history, with annual inflation hovering at about 250 percent and
unemployment at 15 percent.
   Last year, 388,000 workers staged a record 1,720 strikes,
officials said. Montenegro, one of the country's most underdeveloped
regions, has been particularly hard-hit, with thousands of workers
losing jobs through closures of money-losing enterprises.
   As in October, today's demonstration was led by workers of the
Radoje Dakic machine tool factory who went on strike to demand the
resignations.
   Montenegro's government, which is chiefly responsible for
economic matters, gave in to the protesters last year and resigned.
However, the communist leadership in charge of formulating policies
did not.
