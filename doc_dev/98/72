<HEAD>Thousands of Montenegrins Protest Inflation</HEAD>

   An estimated 30,000 people rallied
Sunday in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro to protest inflation
and growing poverty.
   Speakers at the demonstration in the town of Niksic criticized
the government of Premier Ante Markovic that has sought to revive
Yugoslavia's stagnant economy by encouraging market-oriented reforms.
   Ljubisa Stankovic, a member of the presidency of Montenegro, told
the crowd that ``incomprehensible inflation is blocking Yugoslavia's
progress.''
   ``The people of Montenegro cannot support a government that
threatens its existence,'' he said in remarks carried on national
television.
   Markovic, who took office in March, has been denounced in Serbia,
Yugoslavia's largest republic, and in neighboring Montenegro for his
economic reforms.
   But he has received support in Slovenia and Croatia, the most
prosperous of the country's six republics.
   Another speaker at the Niksic demonstration, steel-plant worker
Aleksandar Roganovic, said the rally was the last time the people
would assemble peacefully to draw attention to their demands. ``We
cannot go on like this ... we are hungry,'' he said.
   In January, the entire Montenegrin Communist Party leadership was
removed and replaced after more than 120,000 people demonstrated in
Titograd, the region's capital, protesting economic conditions.
   Yugolavia is struggling with an annual inflation rate of nearly
800 percent.
