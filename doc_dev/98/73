<F P=106> [Report by Miodrag Vukovic from Podgorica] </F>
  [Text] Ivan Milutinovic Square in Podgorica was too small 
to hold all those who wanted to welcome Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. After talks 
with Svetozar Marovic, secretary general of the Democratic Party 
of Socialists, and meetings with the Montenegrin opposition 
parties -- only the pro-Montenegrin bloc did not attend -- 
Zhirinovskiy held a rally in the capital of the republic. The 
fervent atmosphere during the meeting did not result in trouble. 
After being addressed by the Russian leader, the crowd of over 
50,000 people dispersed peacefully and enthusiastically. 
  This enthusiasm was caused by Zhirinovskiy, who greeted them 
with the words that a great Serb had come to his brother Serbs. 
With the victory of his party, Zhirinovskiy said, the Russian 
people had determined a new course in policy, particularly 
toward the events in the former Yugoslavia. No one must strike 
against Serbia, as that would be a strike against Russia. The 
world wants to divide the Balkans into many little statelets, so 
that the West can catholicize half the peninsula, and islamize 
the other half, Zhirinovskiy said. 
  They are trying to destroy our Orthodox religion, and your 
only fault, Zhirinovskiy said, is that you are on the border 
with the West, and therefore the attacks on you are all the 
fiercer. The Russian Army, some 300,000 troops, is still in 
Germany, but if need be it will be moved to the Balkans so as to 
protect its brother Serbs. As for the sanctions, Zhirinovskiy 
said, they can keep them in force. Russia has all you need, and 
will buy everything you can offer. As for defense, if there is 
an attack, you should not give it so much as a thought, 
Zhirinovskiy said, and added that Russia had not only 
state-of-the-art weapons, but also a secret sonar weapon -- as 
it is called -- which it will use for its own defense and for 
the defense of her Orthodox brothers on the territory of the 
present Yugoslavia. 
  Russian might has to be displayed to the world, so as to 
force it to leave the Slavs to live in peace. Russia will make 
it clear that Serbia should not be taken lightly.
