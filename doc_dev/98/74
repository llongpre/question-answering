  [Text] (STA) Podgorica -- The accusation leveled by the 
Belgrade Center for Antiwar Activities against the Montenegrin 
state leadership for war crimes committed against civilians, 
specifically refugees, no doubt seriously endangers the security 
and stability of that state. The accusation is plausible, based 
on documents signed by Nikola Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of 
interior affairs. The documents state that scores of Muslim 
refugees arrested by the Montenegrin police last May were handed 
over to the Serbian police, after which they vanished without a 
trace.
