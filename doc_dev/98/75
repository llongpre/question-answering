  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--Serbia's Deputy 
Commissioner for Refugees Slobodan Popovic said on Monday that 
Germany's decision to expell refugees who hold Yugoslav 
passports was uncalled for, in view of the fact that the refugee 
status is regulated under international law which protects 
refugees everywhere in the world. 
  In a statement made to TANJUG, Popovic specified that, since 
the outbreak of war in former Yugoslavia, between 17,000 and 
20,000 refugees from the breakaway Yugoslav Republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have transited through Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) on their way to Germany as well as to 
America, Asia and Australia. 
  "German authorities appear to see the refugees in only one 
light--viz, as Yugoslavs," Popovic said. 
  Germany has announced its intention to begin expelling the 
refugees from Serbia and Montenegro in three days' time. The 
local press estimates that the decision will affect about 
200,000 refugees, mainly Bosnian Serbs and ethnic Albanians from 
the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija -- holders of Yugoslav 
passports. 
  The Serbian commissioner for refugees believes that this 
unprecedented move on the part of Germany is meant to provoke a 
reaction from Yugoslavia which would then be taken as a pretext 
to continue to pursue the present anti-Yugoslav policy. 
  The German weekly DER SPIEGEL estimates there are about 
350,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia in Germany, 230,000 of 
whom have come from Serbia and Montenegro. This number 
obviously includes Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who 
have refused to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship at the time 
of the disintegration of the Balkan federation and take the 
citizenship of the newly-proclaimed states.
