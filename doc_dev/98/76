   The remains of Montenegro's last king
were returned to his homeland Saturday for a ceremonial reburial
representing the first time Communist authorities have officially
recognized Yugoslavia's royal past.
   The ceremony will entail pageantry unseen in this former Balkan
kingdom since the 1860 coronation of the king, Nikola
Petrovic-Njegos. Royal family members scattered across Europe by
decades of turmoil received enthusiastic welcomes as they arrived
for the reburial.
   Nikola ruled Montenegro, today the smallest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, until 1916, when he was forced into exile by advancing
Austro-Hungarian troops.
   His state funeral and that of his queen, Milena, are scheduled
for Sunday. Her remains were returned with those of Nikola.
   The event represents a milestone in the official stance toward
the nation's history. Until recently, the king was regularly
denounced and ridiculed.
   ``If you had so much as mentioned the king 10 years ago, you
would have landed in jail,'' remarked a bus driver, Luka
Garlasevic, in an interview.
   Remaining in exile after World War I, Nikola died in Italy in
1921, and his mountain domain was incorporated into the
newly-established south Slav kingdom by his nephew, Serbian monarch
Aleksandar I Karadjordjevic.
   Montenegrin and Serbian media have given prominence to the
arrival of members of the former Yugoslav royal family and their
Italian relatives, who will attend the reburial.
   Members of Europe's aristrocracy not seen in Yugoslavia since
the abolishment of the monarchy and the Communist takeover in 1945
were at hand to observe the arrival of the king's remains Saturday.
They were brought to the southern Adriatic port of Bar in
Montenegro on an Italian military boat.
   Prince Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia of Italy, Prince Dimitri
Romanov of Russia and other relatives from elsewhere in Europe were
given warm welcomes on their arrival.
   Hundreds of onlookers crowded around three princesses of the
Karadjordjevic dinasty, which ruled Yugoslavia until the Communist
took power.
   However, Princess Jelisaveta Karadjordjevic told The Associated
Press that Crown Prince Aleksandar, pretender to the Yugoslav
crown, could not come from London ``because of unresolved political
questions.''
   She did not elaborate but apparently was alluding to
Communist-imposed restrictions on all male members of the
Karadjordjevic family.
   Over 20,000 people gathered at the harbor of Bar to welcome the
Italian warship ``San Marco'' with Nikola's remains. Several
Montenegrins in traditional caps ringed the cortege as the coffins
of the king and queen were driven off the ship by Yugoslav navy
vehicles.
   The reburial of the remains in nearby Cetinje, which served as
capital of Nikola's realm, was organized by Montenegro's Communist
authorities. They will be granting his last wish.
   The ceremony will be conducted by priests of the local Orthodox
church, which Nikola headed as bishop during his reign.
   Under Yugoslavia's Communist rulers, the Orthodox church, though
allowed to carry on its activities, has not been permitted any
voice in public affairs.
   The involvement of the church in the reburial appears to reflect
a desire of the new Montenegrin Communist leadership to gain broad
popular support after ethnic and economic protests last winter
forced the entire ruling elite to resign.
   Nikola's achievements still evoke pride among Montenegrins. In a
series of battles against Ottoman Turks, Nikola managed to triple
the area of his small realm and keep it independent.
