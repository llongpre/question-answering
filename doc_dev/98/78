YUGOSLAVIA'S President Dobrica Cosic has been forced out of office by the
federal parliament, through a no-confidence motion brought by radical
Serbian deputies.
The sudden departure of Mr Cosic, accused in the chamber of having held a
secret meeting with Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's
constitutional future, raises fresh doubts about political stability in the
rump state of Yugoslavia, which consists of just Serbia and Montenegro.
In a vote early yesterday, rushed through at the final session of parliament
before the summer recess, deputies from the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical
Party, headed by Mr Vojislav Seselj, were backed by the ruling Serbian
Socialist Party of President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Seselj claimed in parliament that the federal president had also held
secret negotiations with Croatia over the Serb-held region of Krajina, and
was willing to carve up the Serbian province of Kosovo - where 90 per cent
of the population are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring Albania.
Mr Cosic, a leading Serbian writer who used to promote the idea of a Greater
Serbia, was not present in parliament to defend himself. He did not issue
any statement after the vote.
Political analysts said that Mr Milosevic appeared to have sacrificed Mr
Cosic, once a close political ally, in the hope of ensuring his government's
survival in another no-confidence vote, due to be held this month by the
Serbian parliament.
Without the support of hardline Serbian deputies, the minority socialist
government, accused of failing to address a disastrous economic situation,
could be toppled.
Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a
fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, and from other
extremists, by adopting a more conciliatory position.
Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's
border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to prevent the Bosnian Serbs from
being supplied through Serbia with fuel and weapons.
However, Serbian petrol tankers are still to be seen rumbling over the
bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a
result of ousting Mr Cosic.
Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in favour of Mr Cosic during the
debate.
The Montenegrin government, already resentful because United Nations
sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than that of Serbia, is
taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it is willing to accept
UN monitors along its border with Bosnia.
'This vote is to be interpreted as a victory for the hardliners. It has
opened the way for very dangerous developments in Montenegro,' says Mr
Dragoslav Micunovic, a democratic opposition leader.
