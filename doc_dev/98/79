  [Text] The Democratic Action Party has sent a letter to 
diplomatic and consular representations in Belgrade requesting 
that they inform the governments of their countries about the 
latest events in Sandzak, so the "further arrests and 
persecution of Muslims would stop." The letter starts with the 
following words: 
  "Since 25 January of this year, Serbian-Montenegrin police 
have been making mass arrests of Muslims in the area of Sandzak 
and particularly in the Prijepolje, Rozaje, and Bijelo Polje 
communes. In most cases they are arresting the very top leaders 
of the of the Party of Democratic Action. This series of arrests 
started in Urozaje when a group of well-armed members of 
Montenegro MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] arrived in six 
Land Rovers, surrounded the house of the secretary for 
Montenegro, Mr. Rasim Sahman, and took him to some unknown 
location." 
  The letter further states that "despite all our attempts to 
learn the reasons for these arrests, the police authorities have 
not given us any explanation. In the aftermath of these events 
the tense situation in Sandzak has acquired dramatic 
proportions. By means of these and other similar actions, 
Serbian and Montenegrin authorities hope to intimidate the 
Muslim population and create pressure that would accelerate the 
process of their migration from Sandzak. The direct attack on 
the political representatives of Sandzak Muslims is designed to 
repress any form of political expression by these people."
