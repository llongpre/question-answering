  [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia [FRY], created two years ago, is no new state; its 
creation merely confirmed the will of the Serbian and 
Montenegrin people to set up their own state in a new way, FRY 
President Zoran Lilic stated today in an interview to Radio 
Montenegro. He said the current Yugoslavia "emerged under 
domestic and international conditions of general chaos." The 
creation of the FRY was a rational response by the Montenegrin 
and Serbian people to this chaos, Lilic stressed on the occasion 
of two-year anniversary of formation of the common state of 
Serbia and Montenegro. According to him, the founding, 
preservation, and strengthening of the FRY are values of such 
importance that their full meaning will only be able to be 
assessed in retrospect. Lilic also said that it is very 
important to preserve continuity in relation to the former 
Yugoslavia "both because of specific international rights, which 
will have to be recognized, and for the sake of the interests of 
parts of the nation outside the FRY." 
  Most political parties, according to Lilic, have understood 
that they cannot disregard the will of the people when it comes 
to the reasons for the founding and preservation of the FRY, and 
its prospects. The FRY president stated that "sporadic 
disagreements" between the two federal units are only a 
consequence of the difficult economic blockade and other 
unfavorable circumstances. According to him, "the Montenegrin 
people have stoically suffered many trials and tribulations" 
over the past two years. Lilic said the harsh blockade had 
interrupted many positive processes in the FRY. However, even 
in these conditions many changes for the better have been 
achieved. "During two years of condensed history the hardened 
forces have maintained themselves and will be ready for the time 
when the sanctions are lifted," Lilic stressed, expressing the 
hope that this would happen soon. 
  The FRY president on this occasion also repeated his view 
that a peaceful resolution of all the conflicts on the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia remains the only constructive option 
and firm orientation.
