  [Text] Novi Sad, March 12 (TANJUG) -- President of 
Montenegro Momir Bulatovic has stated that the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) is the factor that cannot be bypassed in 
establishing peace in the Balkans so the respect of its state 
and national interests would help stabilize the region. 
  "Policies which do not respect the real state and national 
interests of Montenegro and Serbia, or the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), cannot secure peace and stability in the 
Balkans," said Bulatovic in an interview to the NOVI SAD DNEVNIK 
weekly published in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. 
  Hoping in a soon end of the "isolation, sanctions, and 
international oppression being applied to the F.R.Y.," Bulatovic 
said that "those wanting to exhaust ourselves totally can no 
longer justify to their general public the senselessness of 
everything that has been undertaken against the F.R.Y." 
  In May, 1992, the U.N. imposed comprehensive rigorous 
sanctions on the F.R.Y. for its alleged involvement in the civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, however, there have never been 
any Yugoslav soldiers. 
  "Today it is clear to everybody that the Bosnian question is 
being used in an attempt to solve the fate of NATO, relations 
between America and Russia, global unity within the European 
Union (E.U.), and open pretensions of Japan and Germany to 
become permanent members of the U.N. Security Council," said 
Bulatovic. 
  He pointed out that the road now followed by the Yugoslav 
republics Serbia and Montenegro was neither easy nor entirely 
certain, but this was the only possible road "in keeping with 
the historical, state and national interests." 
  He reiterated a joint stand by Montenegro and Serbia that 
the 
Serb people outside the F.R.Y. were entitled to exercisinig 
their freedom and equitable position that presumed also the 
right to self- determination which had already been used by 
other nations in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Denying the right to self-determination to the Serb people 
in 
the forcibly seceded ex-Yugoslav republics was one of the 
principal causes of the current war in the areas of former 
Yugoslavia.
