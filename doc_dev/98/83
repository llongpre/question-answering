   More than 400,000 voters in the
republic of Montenegro on Sunday elected their representative to
Yugoslavia's nine-member collective presidency.
   It was the first time the election was by secret ballot by the
eligible voters in the republic. Previously, the presidency member
was elected by the republic's Parliament.
   Results were expected Monday in the contest between three
candidates: Nenad Bucin, Mijat Sukovic and Dimitrije Baucal.
   The Montenegro voting was only the second election by secret
ballot in communist Yugoslavia.
   A week ago voters in the republic of Slovenia chose Janez
Drnovsek in a two-candidate race. On May 15 he will become the
federal president and serve for 12 months under the system of
rotating the top post among the members of the nine-man presidency.
   The parliaments of Slovenia and Montenegro still must approve
the results of the elections in their republics.
   The nine-member collective presidency includes representatives
from all six of Yugoslavia's republics, its two autonomous
provinces and the country's Communist Party chief. It was devised
by Yugoslavia's post-World War II leader, President Josip Broz
Tito, who died in 1980.
   ``Now, indeed, everything is in the hands of the working people
and citizens,'' Bozo Stijovic, a Montenegrin Supreme Court judge,
said of Sunday's balloting in an interview with the Politika
Ekspres newspaper.
