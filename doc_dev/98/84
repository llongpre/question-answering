  [Text] The group of French humanitarian aid workers 
belonging to the Premiere Urgence organization who were taken 
into custody by Serb authorities in Bosnia last month, under 
accusations of attempted arms smuggling to the Muslims, were 
released in exchange for several members of a Montenegrin 
militia, according to the Montenegrin Montanafax agency, which 
cites police sources in Podgorica. The seven police officers 
belonging to Montnegrin Ministry of the Interior were on board 
the Lido-2 oil tanker which tried to break througb the 
international blockade last month by attempting to dock in 
Montenegro. The attempt was thwarted by NATO ships.
