Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 2 February issue of the Podgorica, 
Montenegro, daily POBJEDA on page 4 reports that an "original 
map of the so-called state of Sandzak" was found on members of 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] who had been arrested on 
charges of planning an armed rebellion in northern Montenegro. 
According to POBJEDA, the map was printed in the Republic of 
Croatia. The text accompanying the map, the paper notes, states 
that the borders of Sandzak were historically and 
internationally recognized by the decision of the Congress of 
Berlin and the Treaty of Constantinople. The "creators of this 
creation" specify that the state of Sandzak will cover over 
8,687 square kilometers and have a population of 440,000. Among 
the "propaganda material," POBJEDA adds, were brochures printed 
in Iran in Arabic. Pictures of fully equipped fighters in 
"combat poses" illustrated the text of these brochures. 
  According to POBJEDA, Harun Hadzic, president of the SDA for 
Montenegro, and Rifat Veskovic, president of the Bijelo Polje 
SDA municipal committee, were in possession of military staff 
and command organization plans when arrested. The paper adds 
that Hadzic and other SDA leaders had purchased 11 radio 
receivers in Germany and planned to conduct surveillance of the 
Yugoslav Army and police and to destroy communications lines and 
radio stations.
