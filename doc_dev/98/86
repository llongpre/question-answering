<F P=106> [Article by M. Drobnjak: "Terrorists Trained in Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] Details of a dark scenario to organize an armed 
rebellion in northern Montenegrin municipalities and to create a 
so-called state of Sandzak have been slowly reaching the public. 
They all indicate that the key player was Harun Hadzic, 
president of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) for Montenegro 
and vice president of this party for Sandzak. However, his 
closest collaborators, who were assigned subversive-terrorist 
activities, are of no less importance. 
  Thus, Isad Skenderovic, a 29-year-old biology teacher by 
training from Berane, commander of the security sevice for this 
municipality, had one of the more important roles in the plan to 
organize an armed rebellion. He already went far ahead in 
performing his task and formed terrorist groups and a crisis 
headquarters for operations in a state of war. 
  According to the most recent findings of the investigation, 
Isad Skenderovic, together with Hamdija Latic and Muarem 
Skrijelj and an additional 80 persons of Muslim nationality from 
northern Montenegrin municipalities, completed a 
subversive-terrorist course in the Turkish town of Urla. The 
training was conducted by Turkish officers to whom the students 
gave information on locations and organizations of airfields, a 
weapons factory, military barracks, and other significant 
facilities in Montengro and Serbia. After the completion of the 
course, Skenderovic was paid 5,000 German marks in cash for the 
construction of dugouts for the storage of weapons, food, and 
people. 
  According to the statements given during the investigation, 
the training in the Turkish army was very specialized and 
rigorous. It started with the taking of an oath in which the 
terrorists vowed to liquidate without mercy those persons in 
their ranks who were hesitant. Groups of three men, dressed in 
special uniforms, were tasked with tailing and, in the event of 
an immediate danger of war, liquidating prominent personalities 
in northern Montenegrin municipalities. The investigation 
further showed that they planned to destroy bridges and block 
roads, and that, what is most important, they wanted through 
these actions to draw the attention of the West to the allegedly 
threatened position of the Muslims in Yugoslavia. 
  Otherwise, it has been learned that 10 more people from the 
Pljevlja and Rozaje region were imprisoned yesterday and today. 
It has also been learned that the public prosecutor will submit 
a request tomorrow to conduct an investigation of them.
