  [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will sell out 
cheaply at least 20,000 apartments, summer homes and other 
facilities worth over three billion U.S. dollars, whose owners 
are nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the 
president of the Association for the Equitable Treatment and 
Protection of the Property of Yugoslav Citizens, Mirko Lalovic, 
said on Monday. 
  That such a sale will take place is also evident from the 
fact that the Croatian Fund for Privatization announced in March 
the placing on sale of 18 holiday complexes, which are the 
property of firms from Serbia and Montenegro (federal units of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the president of the 
Belgrade Association told TANJUG. 
  Croatia has usurped the facilities, following its forcible 
secession from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991 under the 
pretext that they were public property and has entered them into 
the land register as state property. 
  In order to usurp the private property of FRY nationals, 
Croatia introduced an exorbitant tax on the private property of 
non-Croatian nationals, 15 German marks per square meter 
annually. 
  The same tax for Croatian nationals is 3.75 marks, proving 
that it was a well thought out plan to coerce property owners 
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to give away or sell 
them to Croatians at bargain price. 
  Since payment operations between Croatia and the Federal 
Repubic of Yugoslavia is non-existant, citizens from Serbia and 
Montenegro, Republics making up the Yugoslav Federation, are not 
able to pay their taxes. 
  The Croatian legislator has thus provided, when 
indedebtedness exceeds a third of the value of the taxed 
property, for selling it. The beneficiary will be the state. 
This will happen soon due to the accumulated interest (two 
percent daily), so that summer homes, houses, apartments and 
other facilities, property of FRY nationals have already been 
put on sale, Lalovic said. 
  Such an usurpation of assets contributes to the creation of 
an ethnically clean Croatia, because Serbs and Montenegrans will 
lose their properties in that republic, thus denying them the 
right to return once relations are normalized, he added. 
  Stressing that the Croation attitude towards real estate 
owners from Serbia and Montenegro is unprecedented in 
international law, Lalovic added that they acquired the property 
at the time when Croatia was part of the former Yugoslavia, 
which means under the same conditions as Croats have so that 
they should be treated equally, regardless of the fact that in 
the meantime they have become foreigners. 
  The usurpation of property in Croatia has been recordered by 
over 16,000 Yugoslav nationals. 
  It is assessed however that 25 to 30 percent of owners have 
not done so, expecting that the situation will sort itself out, 
so that it is certain that the total value of properties exceeds 
three billion dollars, Lalovic said in conclusion.
