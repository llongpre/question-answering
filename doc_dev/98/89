  [Text] (HINA) Belgrade -- The "super yugodinar" has begun 
to lose its glow. Alarming news has arrived from Montenegro that 
the exchange rate in transactions between banks and businesses 
is one German mark to 1.5 dinars. 
  Since mostly Serbian firms have been involved in grey hard 
currency transactions, panic has spread in Montenegro that large 
amounts of hard- currency would be taken out of the country. 
Since the introduction of the new "yugodinar," the Albanians in 
Kosovo have disregarded the official exchange rate of one dinar 
to the German mark and demanded two to three dinars to one mark. 
  The spreading instability has raised the possibility of the 
beginning of an end to the economic stabilization program. 
Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic met hurriedly with the 
Serbian and Montenegrin prime ministers and Dragoslav Avramovic, 
architect of the program, who in the meantime had become 
governor of the National Bank. They have decided that the 
official exchange rate must be strictly enforced. They have also 
agreed that high prices for utilities and services present a 
threat to the anti-inflation measures and will therefore have to 
be reduced. 
  Avramovic has still faith that the new dinar, called the 
"avram," will maintain its value and that he will be able to 
resist the pressure to print more money. Some people suspect 
that the dinar has lost value because new money has been printed 
out of fear of strikes, including a strike by workers at an arms 
factory in Kragujevac. Street dealers, who for the time being 
are engaged in smuggling cigarettes, say that they will soon 
return to a more profitable business -- buying and selling 
foreign currency in the black market.
