  [Text] Podgorica, 16 May 1994 -- Owing to a project made 
possible by the OTE, the Greek Telecommunications Organization, 
Montenegro and Yugoslavia will not remain a desert island in the 
"sea" of international telecommunications. A part of the $3.5 
million equipment for digital radio-relay connections, which had 
been bought by Montenegro from the Italian company 
"Alcatel-Teletra" before the sanctions were introduced, will be 
delivered to Montenegro via Greece. Beginning from September 
1996, Montenegro should have an underwater connection from Bar, 
through Durres and Corfu, to the whole world. 
  This is the result of the agreement achieved in Salonika and 
Athens between the Yugoslav and Montenegrin PTT and the 
representatives of the Greek telecommunication service. In 
Salonika, Vucic Cagorovic, the Yugoslav PTT general manager, 
Milorad Jaksic, the Serbian PTT general manager, and Jusuf 
Fetahovic, the Montenegrin PTT general manager, concluded the 
work of expert groups from both countries. 
  There followed a meeting of expert groups in Athens, led by 
Jusuf Fetahovic and Petros Labron, the OTE general manager, in 
which the agreement was reached that Montenegro should be 
included in every project for optic cables planned for the 
Adriatic. 
  Experts consider that the $30 million investment in the 
radio-relay and optic cables project will be the most profitable 
investment in Montenegro. Therefore it is considered that this 
historic endeavor will be fervently supported by the Montenegrin 
Government, especially if we know that both Montenegro and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would profit from it because this 
would enable them to become linked to the international 
communication network. Otherwise they would not only be cut off 
from the world and deprived of the possibility of following 
scientific achievements in this field, but they would also lose 
an important income in hard currency. 
  Taking into consideration all parameters, this will be the 
most profitable ecological and tourist undertaking in the 
ecological state of Montenegro [as published].
