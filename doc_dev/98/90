  [Text] Belgrade, Feb. 5, IRNA -- The Montenegrin Interior 
Ministry has announced charges against eight more Muslims from 
the Sandzak region according to the Belgrade press Saturday. At 
least 150 prominent Muslims have been arrested by the Serbian 
and Montenegrin authorities over the past two weeks and many 
more since Spring 1993, according to Sandzak sources. 
  The accused, according to the Ministry statement, are 
"members of the extreme wing of the (Muslim) Party for 
Democratic Action (SDA), who were preparing to create a republic 
of the Sandzak". Of the four arrested so far, the first, Umer 
Hadzic, is accused of "participating in the constitution of the 
Sandzak Republic on the instructions of Muslim National Council 
(MNVS) chairman, Sulejman Ugljanin." 
  The authorities hold a warrant for Ugljanin's arrest. This 
was carried out, the statement said, "with the help of legal 
experts from Croatia, Bosnia and elders of the Islamic community 
in Zagreb." 
  The other three are accused of forming a parallel "ministry 
of security" for the Sandzak and with possession and 
distribution of arms in Pljevlja, a Montenegrin town notorious 
for its harrassment of the Muslim population. 
  The MNVS has reported mass arrests of prominent Muslims over 
the past ten days, including the leadership of the Montenegrin 
SDA. Muslims are subjected to house searches without warrant, 
the confiscation of valuables and general police terror, MNVS 
said. 
  For two years now, countless attacks on Muslim people and 
property have taken place in Pljevlja and other places in 
Sandzak, a mainly Muslim area which stretches over parts of 
serbia and Montenegro, bordering on Bosnia. 
  According to the fund for human rights in Belgrade, 
harrassment has not been confined to Serb and Montenegrin 
nationalists, but also to large forces of the police and army. 
This has led to the emptying of Sandzak villages of their 
Muslim population and to a mass exodus from the region. 
  Opposition weekly VREME in its latest edition refers to the 
trial of 25 Muslims which opened on January 31 in Novi Pazar. 
According to Belgrade TV's reporting of the event, says VREME, 
"all the accused are guilty already. All that has to be done is 
to pronounce sentence." 
  "Not a word that they were questioned without the presence 
of 
a lawyer, that there was no legal proceeding, that the security 
around the court was of an unprecedented degree, that lawyers 
were searched before they entered the court, that large numbers 
of investigators were scattered about the court and that the 
press had printed parts of the accusation before the trial, 
thus, raising the temperature," says VREME. Ultimately, the 
court was obliged to accept the defence's contention that the 
trial had been prejudiced by advance publicity and to adjourn it 
for ten days. 
  Leading the defence is Kosovo Albanian lawyer, Azem Vllasi, 
himself the victim of a rigged political trial during the surge 
of Serb nationalism which followed the coming to power of 
Slobodan Milosevic in 1988.
