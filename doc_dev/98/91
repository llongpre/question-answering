  [Text] Belgrade, May 16 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President 
Zoran Lilic said on Monday that the visit of Russian Patriarch 
Aleksiy II to the people of Serbia and Montenegro was "a great 
contribution to the efforts being invested for peace and harmony 
in the lands of former Yugoslavia...which has been Yugoslavia's 
policy from the start." Lilic was speaking in a meeting with 
the visiting pontiff of the Russian church, Patriarch Aleksiy 
II, and his host, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy II said this was a difficult time for both 
Russia and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and said it was his 
dearest wish -- in his capacity as emissary of the Russian 
Orthodox Church -- to witness a reconciliation among the nations 
living in the former Yugoslav lands. He explained that his main 
task on this visit was to put into practice an initiative, moved 
jointly with Patriarch Pavle, to effect a meeting with the 
leaders of the Croatian Roman Catholic community and the Bosnian 
Islamic community -- Cardinal Franjo Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema 
Mustafa Ceric, respectively -- in an effort to show the people 
that conflicts should be dealt with through talks, not war. 
  President Lilic said that the two churches had every 
spiritual and moral right to embark on such a mission, and 
described Effendi Ceric's refusal to take part in such a meeting 
at this time as proof that the Moslems are still committed to 
the war option for settling the dispute in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Experience teaches us that, whatever compromises the 
Bosnian 
Serbs might make, the Moslems invariably upset all agreements 
and stage-manage incidents at crucial times, in which they kill 
innocent civilians," Lilic said. He added that the Moslems' 
chief objective was to keep up the campaign of satanising the 
entire Serbian nation in the global media, to which the Russian 
patriarch added that not even the Russian media had painted an 
objective picture of the position of the Serbs. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy II said the Russian church and people 
believed that sanctions against Yugoslavia were unjust and 
should be lifted, a position that had been supported by the 
State Duma (parliament lower house), which had asked that Russia 
lift the blockade of Yugoslavia. 
  The United Nations imposed draconian sanctions on Yugoslavia 
in May 1992, because of the country's alleged involvement in the 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Lilic 
said it was clear to the whole world that the sanctions had 
missed their target, and that the Bosnian war could be ended 
only if all Bosnia's warring nations -- Moslems, Serbs and 
Croats -- were treated equally, i.e. if the Serbs, too, were 
given the right to self-determination, just as the other 
Yugoslav nations. 
  Brotherly nations, such as the Montenegrins, Serbs and 
Russians, must be united on the basic questions of nation and 
state, said Lilic and added that these nations "should do their 
all to cherish their tradition, their spiritual orthodox 
culture, by living in peace and harmony with the other nations 
and confessions, as is the case in Yugoslavia where the 50 
religious communities practice their religious affairs 
unhindered."
