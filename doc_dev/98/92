POLITICAL turbulence in Belgrade boiled over into violence yesterday as
police fired tear gas at demonstrators trying to storm the federal Yugoslav
parliament.
The clash follows the ousting of federal President Dobrica Cosic through a
no-confidence motion brought by radical Serbian deputies backed by the
ruling Serbian Socialists. His departure has raised doubts about political
stability in the rump Yugoslavia, which consists just of Serbia and
Montenegro.
Up to 4,000 demonstrators were brought on to the streets by the head of the
opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, Mr Vuk Draskovic. Chanting 'Rise up,
Belgrade', they smashed windows in the parliament building and tried to
break in. Police wielding truncheons moved into the crowd, who threw stones
at them, and police responded with tear gas.
Mr Draskovic earlier called on his followers to prepare for combat. His call
came after one of his deputies was knocked unconscious with a single punch
by a radical Serb deputy outside the chamber, in the fraught aftermath of
the vote against the federal president.
Mr Cosic was voted out after being accused of holding a secret meeting with
Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's constitutional future. The
head of the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical Party, Mr Vojislav Seselj, also
claimed Mr Cosic had held secret talks with Croatia over the Serb-held
region of Krajina, and was willing to carve up the Serb province of Kosovo -
where 90 per cent of people are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring
Albania.
Political analysts said that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the socialist president
of Serbia, appeared to have sacrificed Mr Cosic, once a close political
ally, in the hope of ensuring his own survival in a no-confidence vote later
this month in the Serb parliament. Without the support of hard-line Serb
deputies, his minority socialist government, accused of failing to address a
disastrous economic situation, could be toppled.
Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a
fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, by adopting a more
conciliatory position.
Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's
border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to stop Bosnian Serbs getting fuel
and weapons via Serbia. But Serbian petrol tankers still rumble over the
bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a
result of ousting Mr Cosic. Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in
favour of Mr Cosic during the debate. The Montenegrin government, already
resentful because UN sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than
that of Serbia, is taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it
is willing to accept UN monitors along its border with Bosnia.
