   The Communist Party leadership of
Montenegro resigned Wednesday along with the southern republic's
collective presidency, a move demanded tens of thousands of people
in two days of protests.
   About 60,000 filled the streets of Titograd, the provincial
capital, Tuesday and 50,000 protested on Wednesday. The outcry
stemmed from continuing economic crisis in one of Yugoslavia's
poorest republics.
   ``The disposition of the workers is clear: to uphold all demands
for changes,'' Titograd television said in a live broadcast.
   Miljan Radovic, head of the Montenegrin party's ruling Presidium,
said: ``The dramatic economic situation has culminated in mass
political dissatisfaction,''
   Montenegro's government resigned last October during similar
protests, which police eventually dispersed with force, but party
leaders refused to step down.
   News of the resignations was wildly cheered by protesters who
chanted outside Parliament: ``Down with armchair leaders!'' ``Down
with scoundrels!'' and ``We want free elections!'' The crowd began
to disperse after the announcement.
   Montenegro, on the southern Adriatic coast, is Yugoslavia's
smallest republic and has a population of about 550,000.
   The average monthly wage has declined to the equivalent of $80,
and 10,000 workers have lost their jobs in shutdowns of industries
that were losing money.
   Wednesday's mass resignation was the first since the party
leadership of Vojvodina province stepped down after demonstrations
last October, a week before the Monetenegrin government resigned.
   On Dec. 20, the central government resigned because of the annual
inflation rate of 250 percent, high unemployment and other economic
problems. It was the first resignation of a national government
since the Communist Party under the late President Tito gained power
after World War II.
