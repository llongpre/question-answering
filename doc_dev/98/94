  [Text] The Albanian authorities have arrested 25 citizens 
of the FRY charged with organized smuggling of oil across Skadar 
Lake. Those arrested belong to a group of Montenegrins from 
Zeta who were shipping oil to Montenegro. The Albanian 
authorities arrested them after supervision of cross-border 
traffic was stepped up in line with UN observers' demands. As 
of Friday Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] had also stepped up customs control measures, 
especially concerning fuel.
