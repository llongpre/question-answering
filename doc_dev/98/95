   The Montenegrin Parliament today
accepted the resignations of the republic's six-man presidency. The
leaders quit following protests over the region's failing economy.
   Montenegro's representative in the federal presidency also
stepped down. The resignations marked the first time the entire
state and Communist Party leaderships of one of Yugoslavia's six
republics had stepped down.
   The ouster of the ruling elite came after more than 120,000
people demonstrated in Titograd, the region's capital, earlier this
week and demanded new leadership because of the disastrous state of
the economy.
   Montenegro's government resigned after mass protests in October.
   ``The current mass dissatisfaction among the workers, students
and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced
by the country as a whole,'' said parliament's vice president,
Bozidar Tadic, in a speech broadcast live on national television.
   The central committee of Montenegro's Communist Party on
Wednesday accepted the resignation of its ruling Presidium and named
interim leadership to prepare for an extraordinary party congress.
   The parliament, which decided that the republic's presidency will
act as a caretaker until new elections are held, also accepted the
resignation of its speaker, Velisav Vuksanovic.
   Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smallest republic and one of its
poorest, has been particularly hard hit by the country's economic
problems and a decline in living standards. The nation faces a $21
billion foreign debt and in 1988 alone inflation ran at 250 percent.
   The average monthly salary in Montenegro is the equivalent of
about $80. Unemployment in the region soared after closure of a
number of unprofitable enterprises previously subsidized by the
federal government.
