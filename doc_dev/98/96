  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 2/6/1994 -- Appreciative 
statements about Romania's position to the crisis in the 
Yugoslav space made by several high-ranking officials of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been clustered by the daily 
newspaper DIMINEATA in its today's issue. 
  Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, said that Romania's position relative to the complex 
situation in the area of former Yugoslavia, including its stance 
in the question of the economic sanctions instated against 
Serbia and Montenegro are remarkable by their being "poised, 
objective, and principled." Romania, he said, "has and is 
playing a realistic and constructive role in the crisis 
affecting former Yugoslavia," by making itself available any 
time to be one of the initiators of negotiated settlements 
pursuing the suspension of the economic sanctions and as a 
country which, after Yugoslavia, has been most affected by these. 
  Momir Bulatovic, president of the Republic of Montenegro, 
showed that between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which 
Montenegro is a constituent part, and Romania the relations have 
always been friendly and cooperative in various fields. "We are 
happy that now, in the difficult situation we are confronted 
with, we have found in Romania and its people feelings of true 
friendship and full understanding. We hope for an as fast as 
possible settlement of the crisis in our zone, so that we can 
resume these relations," Bulatovic said. 
  The prime minister of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, assessed 
that once the sanctions suspended, the conditions would be put 
in place for a direct Romanian-Montenegro cooperation, for the 
mutual benefit of the sides, in sectors like tourism, 
machine-building, ecology, and agriculture. 
  Under the current circumstances, as Milan Grubic, director 
of 
the press department of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry remarked, 
in its relationships with all states, Romania included, 
Yugoslavia makes efforts to reach a balance between each 
country's role and interest in the zone of former Yugoslavia. 
The best experience gained to this effect was in relationship 
with Romania, Grubic said, the ties with this country being "an 
example of communication between two good neighbors. We have 
never been in conflict, we have been bonded by true friendship. 
In our relations with Romania, we started from the principle 
that `ideologies are transient, peoples permanent.'"
