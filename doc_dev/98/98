  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, Feb 1 (AFP) -- A deadly 
Russian secret "laser" weapon which zaps its victims' brains 
will be tested Wednesday [2 February] in Serb-held northern 
Bosnia, Russian ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
said Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Zhirinovskiy told journalists in the Montenegrin capital 
that 
"my officers (soldiers of the Russian army close to 
Zhirinovskiy's party) will carry out a test of the weapon 
tomorrow in a confined space in Brcko." 
  Speaking after a meeting here with Svetozar Marovic, 
secretary general of the governing ex-communist Socialist 
Democratic Party, Zhirinovskiy said: "Russia has several types 
of secret weapon. Their two-pronged effect is impossible to 
survive." 
  The weapon to be tested Wednesday "acts directly on the 
brain, has the power of a laser and is not radioactive but 
ecological," he added. 
  The announcement echoed claims made by the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party in December that Russia possessed a 
secret weapon called the "Elipton" that was more powerful than a 
nuclear bomb and could wipe out the whole of humanity. 
  The claim was dismissed at the end of December by Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  News of the test raised eyebrows in Belgrade as even if the 
weapon existed, the Russian volunteers known to be fighting in 
the former Yugoslavia are generally young men rather than 
officers or technicians. 
  Zhirinovskiy later told a crowd of several thousand people 
gathered in the centre of Podgorica that "Russians and Serbs 
have two enemies, the Catholic religion in the west and Islam in 
the east." 
  Russia had therefore to "play the major role in liberating 
the Slav peoples who are under threat of being converted to 
Catholicism." 
  Zhirinovskiy, who is on a whirlwind tour of republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, was also due to meet with Montenegrin 
opposition representatives here. 
  He visited Serb-held regions of Croatia and Bosnia Monday 
and 
was expected to return to Trebinje, in the self-declared Bosnian 
Serb republic, later Tuesday. 
  Montenegro and Serbia, which form the present rump 
Yugoslavia, are subject to UN-imposed international sanctions 
for backing Serb forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
