  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic today held a meeting in the Palace of the 
Federation with the prime ministers of the republics of Serbia 
and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, the Federal 
Ministry of Information has announced. 
  The meeting was attended by Dragoslav Avramovic; Bozidar 
Gazidova, deputy governor of the Yugoslav National Bank; Zarija 
Martinovic, managing director of the payment transactions 
service, and a number of federal ministers. They examined the 
implementation of this year's economic policy and the program of 
reconstruction of the monetary system and Yugoslavia's economic 
recovery. 
  It was concluded that significant results beyond 
expectations 
have been achieved in the implementation of the anti-inflation 
program, primarily as regards the purchase of foreign currency, 
market supply, and the reduction of hyperinflation. The 
Yugoslav National Bank has up to today purchased foreign 
currency to the tune of 54 million new dinars, and at the same 
time has sold only 3 million German marks, which shows that the 
foreign currency reserves of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
have increased by 51 million German marks in 17 days of 
implementing the economic program. In addition, the level of 
prices over the past seven days dropped by 0.5 percent compared 
with the previous week. Some 150 million new dinars and 5 
million German marks have been deposited in business bank 
accounts. The Yugoslav National Bank has printed notes: 227 
million new dinars have been forwarded to the payment 
transaction service, and 271 million new dinars to business 
banks. [passage omitted]
