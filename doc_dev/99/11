A revised edition of Sir Paul Harvey's "Oxford Companion to Classical 
Literature," originally published in 1937, has long been overdue. The task of 
revision has been admirably carried out by Margaret Howatson in this second 
edition. The object aimed at is unchanged: to provide "a handbook of 
information for readers of the literatures of Greece and Rome, and of modern 
works which (touch) upon the classical world" (Howatson's preface). But to 
attain this object in 1989 requires taking account not only of the many new 
discoveries and reappraisals that have been made in the last half-century but 
also of the fact that the reader of today cannot be presumed to have the 
background of knowledge of the classical world that could be taken for granted 
in the reader of 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, in her revision of Harvey, Howatson not only has incorporated the 
archeological and other findings that have furthered and in some cases 
substantially altered our understanding of certain aspects of classical 
civilization, but also has added new articles and expanded others so as to make 
the book suitable "for any reader who is curious to find out about the 
classical world." All Greek and Latin quotations, which the reader of 1937 was 
expected to be able to read unassisted, are now accompanied by English 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the Oxford "Companions," this one is in dictionary format, consisting 
of alphabetically arranged articles of widely varying length and generality, 
some of them dealing with particular names and terms in a few lines, others 
taking up several pages to treat broad subjects such as philosophy, religion, 
and education. Each of the classical authors is the subject of an article under 
the name of that author that provides a general account of the author's works 
and his or her place in the literary and historical scene; important individual 
works are summarized and discussed in separate entries under the title of the 
work. Literary forms are covered under such headwords as epic, tragedy, comedy, 
historiography, oratory, and lyric poetry. The reader curious to know why the 
term classical often means "ancient Greek and Roman" (as in the title of this 
book) will find an explanation under "classic (classics, classical)." There are 
major articles on Athens and Rome, subdivided into sections on topography, 
history, administration, and economy. Sculpture, architecture, and painting are 
discussed under those words as well as in many related articles on particular 
artists, monuments, and genres (extensive cross-referencing helps the reader to 
find all that is relevant to the subject of interest). 
</P>
<P>
New articles added by Howatson include "astronomy," "Christianity in the Roman 
world," "gods" (dealing with the canonical 12 gods of the Greek pantheon), 
"homosexuality," "polis" (in which the meaning of Aristotle's statement that 
"man is a political animal" is explained), "postal service," and numerous 
others. Other articles have been substantially enlarged. The entries that 
summarize individual books, poems, and plays are still Harvey's (in the main), 
but in general very little has been left unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Companion" seems thoroughly up to date. Full account is taken of the 
decipherment in 1952 of the script known as Linear B and of the implications of 
that decipherment for our knowledge of early Greek civilization: Not only is 
there a new article "Linear A and B," but references to the decipherment have 
been added elsewhere as appropriate (in the articles on Crete, Greece, and 
Mycenae, among others). The "Riace Bronzes," two bronze statues recovered from 
the sea off Italy in 1972, are mentioned in "sculpture." The discovery of the 
tomb of Philip of Macedon at Vergina is discussed. Note is taken of the fact 
that Aeschylus' "The Suppliants," previously believed to be his earliest extant 
play, has been found to be of later date; the increasingly prevalent view that 
the "Prometheus Bound" is not by Aeschylus is referred to as well. A new entry 
is devoted to Menander's comedy "Dyscolus," which was found on papyri published 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate that a handbook to classical literature intended for the 
general reader should pay particular attention to matters that may be the 
subject of popular misconception. For example, the image of the priestess of 
the Delphic Oracle as delivering her prophecies while seated over a chasm from 
which "mephitic vapors" arose has a long history, but Howatson rightly notes 
that there is no good archeological or literary evidence for either the chasm 
or the vapors. She could have added that the notion that the Oracle's responses 
typically were equivocal or ambiguous (an idea so firmly rooted that among the 
senses of the English words Delphic and oracular listed in any dictionary one 
is likely to find something like obscure, ambiguous, enigmatic) is likewise not 
true of any of the Delphic pronouncements regarded as definitely authentic. 
Correcting Harvey, she explains that Pandora's Box was actually a large jar 
(pithos) and became a box only in later accounts through confusion with another 
story (Cupid and Psyche). As with Harvey, she makes it express that Cleopatra 
was Greek by descent, not "Oriental" or "African." 
</P>
<P>
One common misconception not adequately dealt with by Howatson concerns the god 
Apollo: She has retained unchanged Harvey's statement that Apollo was "the god 
of light, sometimes identified with the sun," but it has long been established 
that Apollo was not originally a light-god or a sun-god and that his 
identification with the sun was confined to the speculations of learned 
philosophers until the Hellenistic period at the earliest (Joseph Fontenrose 
has shown that not even in the words of Ovid and other Latin poets of his time 
is Apollo identified with the sun, as commonly supposed). Under "Paris, 
Judgment of," Howatson retains Harvey's view that the Judgment is not mentioned 
by Homer, but this view is based on the assumption that lines 25-30 of book 24 
of the Iliad are not genuine, an assumption not now generally shared (I owe 
this observation to Prof. Steven Lattimore of UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
The preface states that "some guidance is given in the headwords to their 
pronunciation in English," but the marking of vowel lengths is sporadic and 
sometimes erroneous (even allowing for differences between British and American 
usage). Those especially interested in the English pronunciation of classical 
names will find Catherine Avery's "New Century Classical Handbook" more useful 
for that purpose (out of print, but available in libraries). 
</P>
<P>
It should be remarked that Harvey's frequent citations of "interesting points 
of connexion between the classics and medieval and modern English literature" 
(Harvey's preface) have in this edition been substantially truncated or dropped 
altogether, evidently because of the need to make room for new material and 
presumably reflecting a judgment that today's reader is less likely than 
Harvey's was to be interested in references to classical allusions in Milton, 
Shakespeare, or Spenser. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the volume is a chronological table setting forth historical and 
literary events in parallel columns, and a set of maps of the classical world. 
This excellent new edition of an old standby can be highly recommended to 
anyone interested in classical civilization and its legacy.
