FT  16 DEC 93 / Technology: Troubled oil on Europe's waters - Greek worries
over tanker building controls

Greece's shipowners have already had to accept tough new safety regulations
for tankers as the price of keeping access to the US oil transport market.
They are now worried that the UK or even the European Union may adopt
equally stringent measures to prevent disastrous oil spills.
Greek owners control 15 per cent of the world's oil tanker tonnage,
including a high proportion of very large and ultra large crude carriers
(VLCCs and ULCCs). The international tanker fleet amounts to fewer than
3,000 vessels, but its advancing age alarms environmental groups.
Sixty per cent of tankers are more than 15 years old, while most of the
VLCCs and ULCCS operated by Greek concerns were built in the mid-1970s.
The Greeks raise technical objections to the US Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of
1990, the law that could become a model for European legislators. Under its
provisions, all ships sailing in US waters and built after 1990 must have
double hulls, and shipowners face unlimited liability for accidents
involving gross negligence.
John Lyras of Granicos Shipping says: 'We have to live with the double hull
requirement. But the evidence is that it is of limited use in improving
safety, and it's costly.'
The US law resulted from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 which poured more
than 25m gallons of oil into Alaskan coastal waters. Many Greek owners
believe another disaster on the scale of the Braer wreck off Shetland or the
grounding of the Aegean Sea, a Greek-owned supertanker, off a Spanish port -
both earlier this year - would mean the introduction of the double hull
requirement in European waters.
The Union of Greek Shipowners argues that double hulls, with a cushion of
air between the inner and outer steel plating, can reduce oil leakages only
if a collision or grounding occurs at low speeds.
If two ships collide at normal cruising speed, the cargo tanks are likely to
be ruptured and the tanker is more likely to sink. Also, an explosion is
more likely aboard a double-hulled ship in an accident, as the gap is filled
with oxygen which reacts with vapour from escaping oil.
'The fact that the Aegean Sea had a double bottom made things worse. When
the ship grounded, oil got into the space in between and triggered an
explosion. Damage to the ship was more extensive and more oil was spilled
than if it had a single hull,' says George Banos of Moundreas Shipbrokers.
Fitting a double hull adds at least 15 per cent to the Dollars 120m (Pounds
80m) cost of building a supertanker, and cuts its carrying capacity by about
20 per cent.
Several large Greek oil carriers, among them the Onassis, Niarchos and
Livanos groups, have invested in double-hulled vessels. However, with the
shipping industry still in recession, there is little incentive for smaller
owners to switch.
The compromise solution advocated by the International Maritime Organisation
calls for tankers built after 1994 to have double bottoms and a series of
ballast tanks along the length of the cargo deck. But this would not
necessarily cut the risk of explosion as a fully-laden tanker would have air
in the ballast tanks.
As 80 per cent of tanker accidents are caused by human error, there is some
weight in the Greek owners' claims that higher standards of training for
both tanker crews and port officials would be as effective as shipbuilding
regulations.
Also, technologically advanced navigation assistance in congested
international waters could reduce the possibility for collisions and
groundings. 'What is needed is a shore-based electronic system, similar to
an air-traffic control system, that takes account of the limited ability of
a ship to manoeuvre in difficult weather,' Lyras says.
