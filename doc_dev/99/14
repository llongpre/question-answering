   The most dangerous women in the ancient world
spent a fortune on perfume, and the vanity of at least one Biblical
king can be measured by the size of his bathtub.
   The lavishness of the ancients' royal boudoir and bath will be
on display starting Nov. 14 in an Israel Museum exhibition of a
1,000-piece collection of toiletries from ancient Israel.
   Blown-glass eyeliner kits, jewel-studded makeup palettes,
polished bronze mirrors, gold hairpins, faience cosmetic boxes.
   Among the collection is an ivory cosmetic spoon that once held
the eyeshadow of Queen Jezebel, the 9th century B.C. ruler who gave
makeup a bad name. There is also the only surviving juglet of
balsam, the favorite scent of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra.
   ``Cosmetics in antiquity appealed at first to both men and
women. Over the centuries, cosmetics became more used by women,''
said Michal Dayagi-Mendes, curator of Biblical archaeology and
organizer of the exhibit.
   She said cosmetics were used as a means to color the faces of
gods to make them appear less cold and remote. Soon, priestly
attendants adopted the colorings and ultimately so did ordinary
people.
   In the hot, dry climate of the Middle East, cosmetics also
served a medicinal purpose.
   ``Wearing makeup repelled the little flies that caused
inflamation of the eyes. Also, eyeshadow took the place of
sunglasses, reducing the glare,'' she said.
   Like their modern counterparts, ancients squandered vast sums on
pampering themselves, indulging in cosmetic fads that sometimes
were silly and harmful.
   Ancient Egyptians used a reddish ochre makeup over the entire
face. Romans lightened their faces with a powder made from
crocodile excrement. Greek women used a finely ground lead to turn
their faces white and spent hours in the sun to bleach their hair.
   ``The Greeks were aware that the lead caused great damage, but
beauty was above everything else,'' Dayagi-Mendes said.
   Roman women went to great extremes to braid and curl their hair
and many wore wigs.
   But the greasy look was in, mainly because oil was used to
combat lice. The pests and more than 80 lice eggs were found, for
example, on a 2,000-year-old wooden comb recovered recently from
the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea.
   Nero's wife, Pompaea, was especially extravagant.
   ``Every day she took a bath in asses' milk. When she was finally
banished from Rome, she was allowed to take 50 asses with her just
to make sure she could have her daily milk bath,'' said
Dayagi-Mendes.
   Her bath did not survive, but that of Herod the Great was
retrieved a few years ago from his ruined Kypros winter palace near
Jericho. The 1{-ton, six-foot-long alabaster bathtub is a monument
to the grandiose style of one of the ancient world's great builders
and architect of the Second Jewish Temple.
   ``The man obviously had good taste and enjoyed all the
luxuries,'' she said, pointing to the regal tray where oils and
lotions once rested on the side of the tub.
   The costliest luxury in the ancient world, however, was perfume,
and ancient Israelites made the most famous variety, balsam, from a
now-extinct tree that once grew on the edges of the Dead Sea.
   To please Cleopatra, the Roman general Anthony acquired a whole
orchard of the precious balsam trees near Jericho so she would
always have a supply of her favorite fragrance, which cost twice as
much as silver.
   Calling it ``serpent's poison,'' sages of the Jewish Talmud
recount that the daughters of Jerusalem put balsam in their shoes
and, on seeing attractive young men, clicked their heels to release
the fragrance as a lure.
   Today, the only surviving balsam is a 1{-ounce flask covered in
palm matting that has lost all its allure. Only a musty, oily scent
remains in the padded box where it is kept.
   ``It must have been sweet, heavy and oily. It was their taste,
but you can't say more,'' said Dayagi-Mendes.
   To give museum goers a whiff of the past, Dayagi-Mendes has
enlisted the help of experts in Holland and Israel to recreate a
fragrance similar to the ones in Biblical times.
   ``I used all the plants mentioned in the Bible in connection
with perfumes and scented ointments,'' she said, adding that
ingredients included cinnamon, myrrh and frankincense.
   The result is Avishag, a perfume named after a consort of King
David. A two-ounce bottle is being marketed at the exhibition for
$50.
   ``We thought it would be intriguing to smell something of
antiquity, and this way you can take something home to remember
besides a brochure,'' she said.
