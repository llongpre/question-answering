   Money never made up for Christina Onassis'
rootless childhood or the loss of the father she idolized. It could
not ease the pain after three members of her family died within two
years, or save any of her four marriages.
   ``The sudden death of Christina Onassis closes a circle that has
all the makings of a Greek tragedy,'' the daily newspaper
Eleftherotypia said in an obituary. It spoke of the ``tragic fate''
of the Onassis family, which it described as ``a dynasty of death.''
   Christina was 37 when she died on Saturday during a visit to
friends in Buenos Aires. Friends and relatives said she was happy.
Newspapers suggested she had a romantic interest in the brother of
her hostess.
   An autopsy report gave the cause of death as acute pulmonary
edema, accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Family members discounted
the possibility of suicide.
   ``A happy person could never commit suicide and Christina was
content and very happy,'' said Mary Onassis, an aunt. ``Christina
was in the best part of her life.''
   Mario Falak, president of the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos
Aires, said: ``She reserved a suite through Dec. 4. She had so much
baggage our employees had to make two trips to the airport.''
   Ioannis Georgakis, vice-president of the Alexander Onassis Public
Benefit foundation, dismissed suicide reports that arose when
medicine bottles were found on Christina's bedside table.
   ``She had no health problems and it just seems her heart was too
tired to overcome the attack,'' he said.
   Greek newspapers quoted friends as saying the bottles probably
contained diet pills. Christina experienced wild swings in weight
throughout her life, often caused by alternating crash diets and
food binges.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City and spent her
childhood shuttling from there to London, Paris, Monaco, Switzerland
and Greece.
   The three members of her immediate family died in only two years.
Christina's brother Alexander was killed in a plane crash in January
1973, her mother Athena died of a heart attack in October 1974 and
her father Aristotle died of bronchial pneumonia in March 1975.
   ``She could never escape the consequences of a rootless
upbringing,'' according to a ``Aristotle Onassis,'' a 1977 biography
of the Greek tycoon. ``Never an eager student, she learned dancing
under Margot Fonteyn and was educated at a series of expensive
finishing schools. ... She emerged a good linguist but with no sense
of place.''
   Its authors, five investigative reporters on the staff of London
Sunday Times, described Christina's relationship with her father as
``complex and self-contradictory.''
   Onassis women ``had to be satisfactory vehicles for
self-promotion and adoring females; and they had to simultaneously
accept his engulfing protectiveness and withstand his massive ego,''
the biographers wrote.
   Christina was 25 when her father died, and the event had an
enormous emotional impact. News reports said she spent the last two
weeks by his bedside and had to be sedated for more than two days
after his death.
   The biographers quote her as remarking that she found
relationships with men difficult ``because, how can I fall in love
when I have a father like mine?''
   Her love life was as turbulent as her father's.
   She married Joseph Bolker, a Los Angeles real estate broker, in
1971 and they were divorced nine months later. The second marriage,
to Greek shipping heir Alexandros Andreadis, lasted only until 1976.
   Husband number three, Soviet shipping executive Sergei Kauzov,
came on the scene in 1978 and departed two years later.
   Last was Theirry Roussel, a French pharmaceutical heir, in 1984.
Divorce proceedings followed eight months later. They have a
daughter, Athena, now 3.
   Aristotle Onassis married Athena Livanos, daughter of a wealthy
Greek shipowner, in 1946 and she bore him two children, Alexander in
1948 and Christina.
   They separated in 1960 after his highly publicized affair with
opera star Maria Callas.
   He married Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in 1968 and Athena later
became the wife of his business rival, shipowner Stavros Niarchos,
who was married to Athena's sister, Eugenia, until her death in 1970.
   Reports at the time indicated Christina and her father's new wife
did not get along, and the relationship worsened after Aristotle
Onassis died.
   In April 1975, Christina ordered the personal belongings of
Jacqueline Onassis removed from Skorpios, the Ionian Sea island the
family had owned since 1963.
   ``The hate that developed between Christina and Jackie Onassis
determined her future,'' the newspaper Eleftherotypia said in its
obituary.
   Christina plunged into her father's business.
   ``For two years she sat behind a desk learning every phase'' of
it, Apostolos Zambelas, an aide, said in a 1983 interview.
   He said her business training had begun soon after Alexander was
killed.
   ``Alexander was being groomed as the natural heir, something
Christina sort of resented,'' Zambelas said. ``Eventually she got
more than she bargained for.''
   Her brother's death was a turning point in Christina's life.
   Eleftherotypia said in its obituary: ``They shared the same
distress over Jackie _ the widow, as she called her _ who
monopolized their father's attention.''
   Ta Nea, another Athens paper, said: ``Alexander's death left her
inconsolable. It was the moment she understood that her apathy was
over and that she would have to run the fortune.''
   Georgakis, the Onassis Foundation executive, said a board of
trustess will manage the fortune until Athena becomes of age.
