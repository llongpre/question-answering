   A gunman shot and slightly wounded Premier
Turgut Ozal in the right hand as the leader addressed delegates at
his party's convention. At least 20 others were injured.
   The gunman was hit in the arm by return fire from Ozal's
bodyguards and then arrested. Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said
16 other people were wounded by gunfire and four were trampled in
the panic after the attack.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengiz Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
through Ozal's right thumb and exited from the palm. The wound
required three stitches and the premier was in good condition, he
said.
   State television showed a picture of the gunmen at a hospital
and asked anyone who knew him to come forward and identify him to
police.
   The wounded include Labor Minister Imren Aykut, who suffered
scratches on her face, and one Motherland Party member of
Parliament, Beduk said. Two of the wounded required surgery but
were in satisfactory condition, he said.
   It was not immediately clear if the gunfire that hit some of the
wounded came from police or the gunman.
   A police official at the scene, who requested anonymity, said
the first bullet fired by the gunman hit the microphone in front of
Ozal and the second one hit his right thumb.
   Ozal took cover immediately behind the lectern when he heard the
shots, Anatolia said. Delegates and others inside the Ataturk
convention hall also took cover, it said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli said the captured gunman gave
two different names to police and was insisting he acted alone. He
said the gunman first said his name was Hayati Ipek, then changed
this to Kartal, which means eagle in Turkish.
   Despite his injury, Ozal returned to the floor to continue his
speech.
   ``No one can take away the life given by God except God
himself,'' Ozal said.
   The delegates gave him a long standing ovation after this
statement.
   The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, but their
identities were not released.
   Later today, the delegates were expected to re-elect Ozal as
party chairman. There were no other candidates running against him.
   Ozal returned Wednesday from a historic three-day vist to
Greece, the first Turkish premier to visit its traditionally
hostile neighbor in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from his talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they wanted to continue their dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus.
   Cyprus has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sectors since Turkey invaded in 1974 after an
Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   In March 1987, Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed.
   On Thursday, a court sentenced a Greek chemist to four months in
jail for throwing a tomato at Ozal's car on the last day of his
visit to Greece. The chemist said he was angry about Ozal's visit.
   In today's speech to the delegates, Ozal emphasized the
importance of political stability, saying the last decade, marred
by terrorism and an economic crisis, was a lost decade for Turkey.
   Ozal defended his record and recent economic austerity measures.
He said he was not interested in short-term designs and was looking
ahead to the year 2000.
   He was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The 61-year-old premier conceded that Turkey suffers from 75
percent inflation but pledged to halve the inflation rate within a
year.
