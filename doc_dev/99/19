   An interfaith team of Scripture experts led by a gentle-mannered
Princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing what's likely
to become the most widely used Bible in American churches.
   The New Revised Standard Version, put out by six publishers in
various editions, is being distributed in May to bookstores. It has
been authorized and commended by most of the nation's major
denominations.
   ``It offers greater accuracy, clarity and naturalness of
expression,'' said the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, chairman of the
30-member translation committee that turned out the new rendition.
   Drawing on older, more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings
of current English, the work is a fine-tuning of the Revised
Standard Version, completed in 1952, and the most broadly endorsed
version in the years since.
   Metzger, 76, a Presbyterian and courtly, zestful Scripture
scholar of Princeton Theological Seminary, applied this rule in the
new rendering of the ancient texts: ``As literal as possible, as
free as necessary.''
   That demanded that the content adhere to what the original
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts actually say, while phrasing it in
understandable and graceful English.
   ``We never tampered with meanings,'' Metzger said in an
interview. But many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation.
   For example, Zechariah 3:3, previously rendered as ``Now Joshua
was standing before the angel, clothed in filthy garments,''
becomes: ``Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood
before the angel.''
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also holds the copyright on the predecessor RSV,
endorsed by most major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches.
   Despite the contemporary proliferation of Bible translations,
Metzger said the RSV has been the mostly widely used ``modern
speech translation.'' In its 38 years, it has sold more than 45
million copies.
   Revising of it was done by a translation committee of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars.
   Biblical scholars these days ``approach each other in terms of
scholarshilp,'' not denomination, Metzger said. ``There's a
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not
seen before.
   ``The differences are in theology, not in biblical studies.
Irrespective of denominational affiliations, matters of theological
interpretation fall into the background. So far as the book goes,
we are essentially one.''
   Most teams producing Bible translations are paid for their work,
but the NRSV group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or
share in royalties. It's ``a contribution'' to the churches,
Metzger said.
   Formal publication date and church celebrations of it were
scheduled in September, but a May 1 start was authorized for
distribution to stores.
   While some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive
language in the new translation, Metzger's criteria required
adherence to the texts. However, many terms previously rendered as
male were originally inclusive.
   He said that masculine pronouns or the words ``man'' or ``men''
often were used previously in passages in which the original text
allows for more generic usage such as ``one'' or ``people.''
   For example, Matthew 6:30 previously was rendered ``O men of
little faith,'' but now is rendered, ``you of little faith.''
Metzger said the word for man wasn't present in the original.
   Similarly, John 12:32 previously was rendered, ``And I when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.'' The latter
phrase now becomes, ``...draw all people to myself.''
   However, pronouns referring to God and Jesus remain masculine.
``We were not authorized to change them,'' Metzger said, adding
that there was no ``tampering with the gender of deity.
   ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the Son of God.''
   However, uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God are
changed to ``you.'' ``In the Hebrew and Greek texts the same form
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to God and
people,'' Metzger said.
   He calls the new translation both ``the newest and oldest
version'' since the translators used ancient texts only recently
discovered, such as the Dead Sea scrolls providing much older
manuscripts of the Old Testament.
   Some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers
in church readings were changed to correct possible
misunderstandings.
   For instance, Psalm 50:9, that previously read, ``I will accept
no bull from your house,'' becomes, ``I will not accept a bull from
your house.'
   Also, Paul's letter in Second Corinthians ll:25 previously read,
``Once I was stoned.'' It now reads, ``Once I received a stoning.''
   Publishers distributing the NRSV are Cambridge University Press,
Thomas Nelson Publishers, Inc., Holman Bible Publishers, Oxford
University Press, World Bible Publishers, Inc., and Zondervan
Corporation.
   In addition, the American Bible Society has been authorized to
offer the NRSV as part of its program, and Collins Ltd., is
publishing an edition in Great Britain.
