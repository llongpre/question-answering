   The legend of the Greek shipping tycoons began
earlier this century with the ``sea wolves,'' sea captains who
acquired vast fleets, dynamic magnates with business savvy and a
gambler's touch. Their lives and loves were chronicled on the front
pages of the world press. Now a new breed is at the helm,
introducing modern business practices, and much of the adventure
has been lost.

   They were the Golden Greeks, fiercely
independent men who controlled the world's shipping, built lush
island paradises and married society's most glamorous women.
   Aristotle Onassis, Stavros Niarchos and their contemporaries are
still revered in Piraeus, base of the powerful Greek shipping
industry. But today a new tycoon is succeeding them: the young
businessman who shuns publicity and knows computers as well as
compasses.
   ``Twenty years ago, a shipowner was treated like a god,'' said
Diamantis Diamantides, who controls 25 ships. ``Now he's a simple
person.''
   The Greek shipping tradition is thousands of years old, a
product of the country's entrepreneurial talent and its kinship
with the sea, which is within 50 miles of almost any part of Greece.
   The legend of the Greek tycoon began earlier this century with
the ``sea wolves,'' sea captains who acquired fleets. It reached
its personification in Niarchos and Onassis, volatile, dynamic
magnates with business savvy and a gambler's touch, whose lives and
loves were chronicled on the front pages of the world press.
   Many of the newer managers have maintained their predecessors'
passion for the sea and their strong preference for family-run
firms. But they are increasingly making longer-term investments,
imposing modern business practices and buying newer, high-tech
ships.
   ``We're tending toward structured companies in corporate form as
opposed to personality-driven, Onassis-type companies,'' said
Emmanuel A. Vordonis, director of Thenamaris Ships Management Inc.
   Until recently, Greeks owned the world's largest merchant fleet.
The Japanese are now No. 1 but Greece is close behind, with 82
million tons of cargo-carrying capacity, according to the
authoritative shipping magazine Naftiliaki.
   Some of the change of style in Greek shipowning is due to the
crisis that hit the industry from 1975 to 1987, stemming from
overbuilding of ships and competitive freight-rate cutting at a
time of stagnating world trade. This bustling port near Athens is
still haunted by memories of proud shipowners losing their vessels
to creditors.
   Diamantides, 42, who began buying ships in 1975 after working in
shipping offices, says old-time magnates could get bank loans on
the strength of their names.
   ``Now you have to convince them with your figures,'' he said.
   Business practices also have changed with the infusion of a
different kind of shipowner _ either entrepreneurs from industry or
construction attracted by a potential fortune, or the children of
traditional shipowners, who have received advanced degrees in
business or engineering at British or American universities.
   ``The new generation of managers has a different investment
approach,'' said Dimitri Krondiras, the local director of Citibank,
the major lender for Greek ship purchases. ``This new generation
perceives that investment in shipping is high-risk.''
   Because of that gamble, some shipowners have diversified into
oil, banking or hotel chains. Others are trying to cater more to
the changing market, purchasing newer, more customized ships.
   A few shipowners are even beginning to raise money by opening
their companies to outside investment and floating shares on the
stock market _previously ``a kind of heresy in Greek shipowning,''
says George Anastassopoulos, the former head of the Transport
Commission in the European Parliament.
   One example of the new Greek tycoon is Thanasis Martinos, whose
family founded Thenamaris. Hailed as the ``Mozart of shipping'' for
his precociousness, Martinos entered the business as a teen-ager
when his mother and her brothers _ a shipping lawyer and a sea
captain _ bought their first ship.
   Martinos worked with the firm while studying economics in
London. Now 40, he and his two brothers head Thenamaris, which runs
55 ships itself and manages about 20 for other people.
   Vordonis, the director of the firm, says the older generation
``had the risk approach, the hard-work approach, the
entrepreneurial approach to bringing resources together that were
difficult to bring together.''
   Now, he says, shipowners rely on high-speed information relayed
by computers, tight cost control and a team approach.
   Where old-style magnates used to make most decisions, sometimes
screaming down cowering subordinates, the modern entrepreneurs are
trying to attract and rely on technical experts to keep up with a
fast-moving, efficient, more high-tech field.
   ``In order to achieve, you need technology, modern management
techniques,'' Vordonis says. ``You go into how to manage people.''
   A glance at the Thenamaris offices illustrates the change.
Unlike the traditional rough-and-tumble offices tucked along the
Piraeus waterfront, Thenamaris is a gleaming, glass-and-concrete
ring in a lush coastal suburb. Sunlight pours into an airy core;
water trickles through leafy plants in a central atrium.
   ``We have round tables, where everyone feels equal. We tried to
make it as friendly as possible,'' Vordonis says. ``In addition to
achieving efficiency, you must have people working in a high tone.''
   In addition to keeping a lower profile at the office, the new
tycoons avoid publicity in their private lives. Gone are the days
when Niarchos and Onassis competed in the public eye, building
ever-bigger yachts and purchasing islands they turned into
paradises with imported trees and exotic birds.
   Onassis dominated gossip columns through his affair with opera
singer Maria Callas and later marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, while
Niarchos married, among others, Charlotte Ford, daughter of
carmaker Henry Ford.
   Today's shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in
Athens' northern suburbs and vacation getaways on the Greek
islands, as well as homes in London, Switzerland or Monte Carlo.
   But they are content to stay out of the spotlight. Some say a
high profile would hurt their efforts to emphasize a team approach
in their businesses.
   Whether the new tycoons will achieve the success of their
predecessors is still an open question.
   Many firms are still run by the older generation, with their
sons or daughters waiting in the wings to test newer business
strategies.
   And while the younger managers may have more sophisticated
economic approaches, shipowning is still highly risky and dependent
on many outside factors, such as wars and the price of oil.
   Anastassopoulos says the new shipping executives go to the best
schools and are better prepared than their predecessors. But, he
adds, ``Whether they will be as intelligent and adventurous as
their fathers remains to be seen.''
