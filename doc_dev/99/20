FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: Less classical than sitcom: the RSC's 'Ion' - Theatre

To the classical Greeks, 'comedy' simply meant any play which ended more or
less harmoniously - without any high-born corpses or divine condemnations to
speak of. Actual humour didn't come into it. To stage such drama in the
present day is to walk a perilous line between the nature of the original
material and current expectations of the genre.
The two first-ever professional English-language productions of Euripides'
play opened this month. In a fortnight, the Actors Touring Company stages
Kenneth McLeish's translation in Cardiff prior to a national tour, but first
out of the traps is the director-translator partnership of Nicholas Wright
and David Lan for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Euripides' world view was far from clear cut: to him, morality shifted with
changing circumstances and the gods had their own agenda, to which men and
women were as flies to wanton boys.
One cannot help thinking that Wright and Lan's version of Ion would
perversely appeal to the old boy, founded as it is on the notion that
momentous events - a liaison between the god Apollo and a mortal woman,
leading to the foundation of virtually the entire Greek race - can be
recounted in the trite vocabulary of suburban sitcom.
Jude Law is cleverly cast as the temple servant of Apollo whose reunion with
his mother forms the narrative core of the play. This energetic young man is
not the stuff of legend: one minute he may be musing profoundly, 'if the
gods lie, how can we ever know the truth?', but the next - as a supplicant
to Apollo's oracle has just been misinformed that Ion is his son - he is
sending off over-enthusiastic and apparently suspect attentions with, 'you
wouldn't believe how often I have to put up with this . . . especially from
foreigners'.
As Ion gropes towards the truth of his parentage like a less-fraught
Oedipus, Law conveys the confusion and extremity of emotion without lapsing
into classical angst. He is supported in this tonal no-man's-land by Peter
Guinness as his stepfather Xuthus, an affable cove but not what you would
call blessed with diplomacy.
The women on stage are more unambiguously earnest, but sometimes seem a
little too far gone. When Creusa (Diana Hardcastle) plots the murder of Ion
before discovering that he is her own child, Wright and Lan fail to
integrate the scene's cut-price Medea-isms with the overall dramatic curve
of the play. Also awkward is the presentation of speeches by the
seven-strong chorus of Creusa's maidservants; after a promising beginning as
a kind of Women's Institute tour party, they fall into a habit of what can
best be described as synchronised writhing. Greek choruses are always a
devil to stage in modern productions; suffice it to say that this particular
option is less than triumphant.
However, the dominant note of the production remains its determined
anti-nobility. The gods and their doings are held up not to ridicule but to
chuckles of banal recognition, and Euripides' lines are rendered in a style
not unlike a kind of ancient Athenian Galton &amp; Simpson.
