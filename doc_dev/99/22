   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright, a team of
philologists and a Soviet museum are among this year's recipients of
the Onassis awards, worth $100,000 each, it was announced today.
   American physicist Amory B. Lovins and British doctor Dame Cicely
Saunders also will receive awards, the Alexander S. Onassis Public
Benefit Foudation said.
   The prizes honor international contributions in scholarship,
human rights and the environment.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou will present the awards April 20 at a
ceremony in Athens.
   Fulbright, 84, of Arkansas, will receive the Athinai prize for
``his major contribution to education by establishing this century's
largest international study fellowship program of academic and
cultural exchanges,'' said the foundation's president, Professor
Yannis Georgakis.
   Leningrad's State Hermitage Museum, cited for its archaeological
excavations along the Black Sea coast, will receive the Olympia
prize for its contribution to culture.
   Dame Cicely, who in 1961 founded the London-based St.
Christopher's hospice for the terminally ill, will split the
Aristotelis prize for Man and Society with the Hellenic Spanish
Dictionary.
   ``We are honoring this dictionary for its important contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek,'' said Georgakis.
   The Onassis prize for Man and His Environment goes to Lovins, 41,
for ``his notable contribution to the protection of the natural
environment by working towards alternative solutions to contemporary
energy problems,'' Georgakis said.
   In 1982 Lovins established the Colorado Rocky Mountain Institute,
which explores links between energy, water, agriculture and economic
development.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of Greek
shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in honor of his son, who died
in a plane crash in 1973.
