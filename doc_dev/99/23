   Former U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright and
American physicist Amory B. Lovins were among those honored
Thursday with the annual Onassis prizes.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou gave out the awards, totaling
$400,000, at a ceremony in a packed chamber of the former
Parliament building.
   The Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation presents the
prizes to honor international contributions in scholarship, human
rights and the environment.
   The main award, the Athinai prize, went to Fulbright, 84, for
establishing this century's largest international fellowship
program of academic and cultural exchanges.
   ``In the words of your tutor at Oxford, you are `responsible for
the largest and most signifcant movement of scholars across the
face of the earth since the fall of Constantinople in 1453,''' John
Brademas, president of New York University told the Arkansas
Democrat as ministers, diplomats and local dignitaries looked on.
   Fulbright said he hoped the exchange progam he founded more than
40 years ago could play a role in ``enhancing mutual
understanding'' between countries.
   ``Through the international exchange program, I hope the young
people of the world will learn from one another ... if the outlook
for peace is as good as I think and pray it is, then these young
people will have the sort of world and future they are intended to
have,'' Fulbright said.
   Lovins, who in 1982 founded the Colorado Rocky Mountain
Institute that explores energy, water, agricultural security and
economic development, received the $100,000 Delphi Prize for Man
and His Environment.
   ``As Delphi is the navel of the ancient world, so energy is in a
sense the navel of modern society ... rediscovering our solar
rootstock, and grafting modern efficiency technologies onto it,
offers good news for all people and for the Earth,'' said Lovins,
41.
   Soviet professor Boris Piotrovsky, director of the
Leningrad-based Hermitage Museum, picked up the $100,000 Olympia
Prize for Man and Culture.
   The museum was honored for its discovery of several ancient
Greek cities along the Black Sea coast in its more than 150 years
of investigating the area.
   ``This award strengthens the bonds and cooperation that exist
between Soviet and Greek scientists involved in the history of the
ancient world,'' Piotrovsky said.
   The Aristotelis Prize for Man and Society went to both the
Hellenic Spanish Dictionary and Dame Cicely Saunders, who
established the London-based St. Christopher's Hospice for the
terminally ill in 1961.
   The Spanish Hellenic Dictionary was honored for its contribution
to the study and understanding of ancient Greek. Spanish professor
Francisco Rodriguez Adrados accepted the award.
   The Onassis Foundation was set up in 1975 by the estate of the
late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle S. Onassis in memory of his
only son, who was killed in a plane crash in 1973.
   Until November 1988, the philanthropic organization was headed
by Onassis' daughter, Christina. Ms. Onassis, 37, died Nov. 19 of
an apparent heart attack in Argentina.
