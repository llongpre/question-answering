   Greek shipping heiress Christina Onassis,
who died Saturday of a heart attack in Argentina, was a global
jet-setter worth an estimated $1 billion.
   The only daughter of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis,
Miss Onassis inherited his fortune _ and control of his two major
shipping companies, Springfield Shipping of New York City and
Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo, France _ after her father's death
in 1975.
   Miss Onassis, 37, led a stormy life that often captured newspaper
headlines. She was married four times and had one daughter, Athena,
named after her late mother and her father's first wife.
   Miss Onassis suffered a heart attack and died Saturday while
visiting a country club on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
where she was visiting a longtime friend, officials were quoted as
saying.
   Onassis' only other child, Alexander, died in a plane crash
earlier in 1975 before his father's death, leaving Christina as the
only heir to the family fortune, estimated at around $1 billion.
   Miss Onassis reportedly didn't get along with her step-mother,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who married her father in 1968. Mrs.
Kennedy Onassis' first husband, President John F. Kennedy, was
assassinated in 1963.
   After Onassis died in 1975, his daughter and other members of the
Onassis family reportedly offered Mrs. Kennedy Onassis a
multi-million dollar settlement to give up her rights to the Greek
magnate's estate, news reports at the time indicated.
   Ms. Onassis was stricken with a heart attack Saturday at 11 a.m.
(10 a.m. EST) at the Tortuguitas Country Club, about 30 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires, Dr. Hernan Bunge, a director of the
Clinica del Sol Hospital in the Argentine capital, was quoted as
saying.
   Miss Onassis arrived in Argentina approximately two weeks ago to
visit Marina Dodero, a long-time friend.
   She reportedly was stricken as she prepared to go swimming in a
pool at the country club home of Mrs. Dodero and her husband,
Alberto.
   Miss Onassis was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires.
   Miss Onassis also lived in Paris and St. Moritz, Switzerland. She
also owned the Greek island of Skorpios in the Ionean Sea, which she
inherited from her father. She also one time was toying with the
idea of buying the island of Corisco, located in the Atlantic Ocean
off the coast of central Africa, news reports indicated.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City, and was first
married in 1971 to Los Angeles real estate broker Joseph Bolker. The
marriage ended in divorce nine months later.
   She later married Alexander Andreadis, the heir to another Greek
shipping fortune, but that marriage also ended in divorce in 1976.
   In 1978, she married a third time, in Moscow to Sergei Kauzov, a
Soviet shipping executive, but it lasted less than two years.
   In March 1984, Ms. Onassis married French businessman Thierry
Roussel in a civil service in the fashionable 7th district of Paris,
followed by a religious ceremony at a Greek Orthodox church.
   She told a French magazine at the time that she fell in love with
Roussel when she was 21 and they vacationed together on Skorpios,
the family island.
   Roussel's grandfather was the founder of a leading French
pharamaceutical company, Roussel-Uclaf, but it was sold by the
family more than 20 years ago.
   The couple had a daughter, Athena, in 1985 and she was baptized
in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on the private island of Skorpios. The
girl was immersed in a silver font specially made for the ceremony
and christened by Greek ship owner George Livanos, said news reports
at the time. The couple filed for divorce in about eight months
later.
