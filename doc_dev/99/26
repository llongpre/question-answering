   Prehistoric American civilizations were not
built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts,
says archaeologist Wilburn ``Sonny'' Cockrell of Florida State
University.
   The origin of the mound builders of North America and the
pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored
on ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' on public television
Wednesday night.
   ``A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to
an almost racist view of the American Indians,'' said Cockrell.
``They look at the high civilizations these ancient people built,
at their complex cultures and monumental achievements, and refuse
to accept that they were American aboriginals.
   ``Popular writers from the 18th century on looked at the mounds,
at the Anasazi pueblos in New Mexico, at the ruins of cities in
Central and South America and said they must have been built by
some vanished race. Later writers came up with the notion of
Egyptians and ancient astronauts.''
   Cockrell says the early Americans crossed a land bridge that
connected Asia and western North America in the Ice Age.
   ``Due to the mile-thick continental glaciers, the oceans were
300 feet lower, allowing these first immigrants to enter the New
World,'' Cockrell said in a telephone interview from Warm Mineral
Springs, Fla., where he is director for FSU's archaeological
research project.
   ``There were several waves of immigrants, and this show depicts
what scientists know about these people and their descendants. We
survey them over a wide geographic range and over a long temporal
range and look into questions as to why particular cultural
manifestations arose and why they disappeared.''
   The one-hour documentary is part of ``The Infinite Voyage''
series and will appear later on some commercial stations. The show
is a joint venture of PBS and the National Academy of Sciences and
was produced by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh.
   Cockrell is serving as spokesman for the show, although he
appears on the broadcast only in sequences about his project,
recovering the 12,000-year-old remains and artifacts of
Paleo-Indians from a sink hole.
   ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' will be followed in
subsequent weeks by reruns of four shows from last season.
   ``The celestial observations of the native Americans,
specifically Central Americans, were more sophisticated and had
greater accuracy than those of Western civilization,'' he said.
``Their understanding of astronomical events and the
interrelationship of celestial movements extends back at least one
millennium before the birth of Christ and probably earlier.
   ``They had the concept of the zero before Westerners. The
Post-Classic Mayans had libraries full of books called codices
which extensively documented Mayan culture. These libraries were
destroyed by the Spanish, who assumed that since these Indians
weren't Christian their ability to read and write was in conflict
with the Spanish concept of God.''
   The documentary ranges from the now-submerged land bridge
between Siberia and Alaska to the jungle-covered pyramids in
Central America. The trek of the first immigrants from Asia is
re-created by a group of Native Americans.
   The program then moves ahead to Warm Mineral Springs, where
Cockrell heads the archaeologists and paleontologists recovering
remains of the Paleo-Indians. Inland from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
another FSU group led by Dr. Glen Doran is shown excavating a
7,000-year-old cemetery from the Archaic period.
   ``The recovery of the skeleton of a 16-year-old male who
suffered from spina bifida indicates that the people were
compassionate and economically stable enough to care for a helpless
member of their group throughout his life,'' he said.
   The show then goes to Chaco Canyon, N.M., where National Park
Service archaeologists and their colleagues are looking into the
complex civilization of the vanished Anasazi culture.
   ``Archaeologists are careful to use the term culture,'' said
Cockrell. ``People don't vanish, but cultures vanish. People live
on but adopt or become participants in other cultures. It's rare
that an entire population vanishes, such as the concept of Atlantis
falling into the sea.
   ``The civilization of Atlantis did not vanish into the sea. The
myth refers to the dissolution of the culture of the Minoan Crete,
probably by the eruption of a volcano. The people remained to
become the inhabitants of the Greek islands and classical Greece.''
   Cockrell said non-profit educational institutions are encouraged
to videotape the show. The Digital Equipment Corp. has distributed
25,000 teaching guides to schools.

   Elsewhere in television:
   EASY RIDERS _ Johnny Carson says one of the reasons Jay Leno's
contract as exclusive guest host of NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' has
been extended is that he owns several motorcycles. ``It solves the
transportation problem, in case his car breaks down,'' explained
Carson. ...
   ON THE ROAD _ Pierce Brosnan, who is starring in the NBC remake
of ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' has been joined by Jack
Klugman, Patrick MacNee, Sir John Mills, Pernell Roberts, David
Soul, Mel Tillis and Simon Ward for the six-hour miniseries version
of the Jules Verne classic.
