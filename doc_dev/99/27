<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oil Pipeline for Greece Through </F>
Bulgaria Planned"] 
  [Text] The construction of a Bulgarian-Greek oil pipeline 
from Burgas to the Aegean port of Alexandroupolis, an idea 
launched last month during the talks in Moscow between Greek 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, will neutralize Turkey's oil ambitions in the region. 
In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of 
transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I 
KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes. 
  The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria, 
is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist 
strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims 
live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes. 
  Athens views the idea of constructing a Greek-Bulgarian oil 
pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea as a counterpoint 
to the Turkish strategic plans aimed at establishing eventual 
control over the export of Russian oil. According to Athens, 
Turkey also aims at establishing control over the oil of the 
former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea. 
  By constructing the Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline Russia 
would 
be able to free itself from its dependence on Turkey and 
simultaneously, the strategic positions of Greece and Bulgaria 
will be strengthened.
