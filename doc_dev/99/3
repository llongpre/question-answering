There has been mileage in Homer since 600BC when the 'Sons of Homer' formed
a guild for public readings of The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Alan Howard and Christopher Logue are continuing the tradition with Kings at
the Cottesloe Theatre, a reading from Logue's 1991 version of the first two
books of The Iliad.
This two-man, 90-minute performance shows how compelling epic can be when
well presented.
Aristotle was right to think that it should be read and not acted. Logue's
Kings follows his epic companion piece, War Music (1981), which comprised a
version of books 16-19 of The Iliad.
His story keeps close to Homer, recounts the growing dissent among the
Greeks, their reaction to the imperiousness of Agamemnon, the sulking of
Achilles at the loss of his captured woman, Briseis, and the fatal prayer he
offers to his mother Thetis, to make the Greeks suffer.
Homeric style combines seriousness and accessibility: armies are compared to
forest fires, or flies around a milk pail.
Logue has caught the scope and pitch of Homeric epic by using translations
from Chapman (1611) to Rieu (1950) and evolving a supple, muscular verse.
He has also preserved the wit in Homer. Besides the whining, jibing
Thersites, there is a malicious Athena ('We have arranged another death for
Agamemnon') and a skyful of ludic gods: 'How can a mortal make a god smile?
Tell him his plans.'
The Homeric lyricism has also been kept: retained: 'The dawn stepped
barefooted from her lover's bed and shared her beauty with the clouds.'
Logue has wisely kept his own speaking contributions relatively slight. The
evening is carried by Howard.
From the opening lines, 'Think of the East Aegean sea by night ..', Howard
is magnificent, delivering the speeches of Greeks and Gods seamlessly
intercut with passages of narration.
He crouches for the opening on a tall stool, fists clenched, conjuring
figures from the Greek camp out of the sea mist.
The famous speech from Odysseus, persuading the Greeks not to follow
Thersites home, is stunning.
Thersites has raised the cry of 'Home' like sudden gusts darkening a lake;
Odysseus calms the soldiers and beats him with a cane before handing the
situation back to Agamemnon.
Howard makes it come alive, and for a moment, you are standing on the shores
of history by the wine-dark sea.
Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2033) until 19 September, and 27-29 October.
Christopher Logue's Kings is published by Faber.
