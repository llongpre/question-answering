   Merchant sailors who bobbed in 30-foot
seas after Hurricane Bertha splintered their cargo ship stepped
ashore with praise for their Soviet rescuers and acceptance of the
ocean's fury.
   Rolando Arellano, an apprentice officer from Manila,
Philippines, said Friday he would resume his oceangoing life and
vowed not to give in to fear. ``No _ this is life at sea,''
Arellano said.
   Twenty-one survivors of the wrecked freighter Corazon were
brought ashore by a Soviet fishing support ship that plucked them
from churning seas in the Atlantic about 400 miles east of New York.
   Six crew members, including most of the ship's officers, died in
the wreck Tuesday.
   ``What made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the
height of the waves, as well as the rainstorms, very little
visibility,'' said Capt. Vladimir Pushnoy, skipper of the Soviet
ship M-V Leonid Leonidov, speaking through an interpreter at a news
conference.
   One man spent about 10 hours in the water before he was hauled
to safety, Pushnoy said.
   The survivors were mostly Greek or Filipino sailors aboard the
593-foot freighter hauling tons of cement from Greece to New York.
   ``We are very lucky,'' said ship's cook Pantelis Potiris, of
Athens, Greece. ``It was very bad, very rough.''
   Arellano said he spent about five hours floating in the water
after his life raft capsized.
   ``I hope only to stay alive,'' Arellano said. ``I always pray to
God. We are thinking of our family and to save ourselves.''
   Many survivors had only life jackets for flotation, and the
yellow vests were hard to see amid the foam and spray of the rough
water, Pushnoy said.
   After the Corazon sent a distress signal Tuesday afternoon, the
U.S. and Canadian coast guards provided information to help the
Leonid Leonidov and several other ships find the survivors.
   Two other ships in the area got close to Corazon crew members
but couldn't get them aboard.
   Pushnoy said his ship was able to pull off the rescue because
his 46-member crew is used to working on the open sea and tying up
with other vessels under adverse conditions.
   Survivors from the Corazon hugged their rescuers after the rusty
Soviet ship pulled into port.
   ``The Russians are good,'' said one survivor, giving a thumbs-up
sign.
