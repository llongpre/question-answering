   The body of Greek shipping heiress
Christina Onassis arrived in Greece today from Argentina for burial
on her family's privately-owned island in the Ionian Sea.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died in Buenos Aires on Saturday of an apparent
heart attack, but the cause of death is still under investigation.
   Her body was flown to Athens on a chartered Olympic Airways
aircraft from Geneva after it arrived on a regular Swissair flight
from Buenos Aires.
   Olympic was founded in 1957 by her father, shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis, who then sold it to the Greek state in 1975.
   Accompanying the body were a group of relatives and Ms. Onassis'
fourth ex-husband, French multimillionaire Thierry Roussel.
   A memorial service will be held for Ms. Onassis on Friday in the
Greek Orthodox church of Aghia Fotini in the Athens suburb of Nea
Smyrni.
   Ms Onassis' body will be flown to northwest Greece early Saturday
and then put aboard a launch for the short trip to the island of
Skorpios, where she will be buried next to her father and her
brother, Alexander.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million when
her father died in 1975. The remainder of his $1 billion fortune was
given to the philanthropic Public Benefit Foundation.
