   An escaped convict shot and wounded
Premier Turgut Ozal on Saturday, police said, moments after Ozal
urged his country to reject violence. Twenty-one people, including
the gunman, were injured when police opened fire and the crowd
stampeded.
   Ozal, 61, was shot in the right hand and slightly wounded as he
gave the opening speech at the convention of his governing
Motherland Party.
   ``We have a more civilized atmosphere now. People of different
views can now talk to each other instead of fighting or drawing
their guns,'' Ozal said before the first shot struck the
microphone. A second bullet hit Ozal.
   Police fired at the assailant and hit him in the arm.
   Scores of people ran screaming as shots rang out. Sixteen
suffered bullet wounds, and four were bruised in the stampede.
   Prosecutor Cemal Ozer, who interviewed the gunman in a hospital,
identified him as Kartal Demirag, 32, and said he escaped from the
Mugla prison in western Turkey six months ago.
   Ankara governor Saffet Arikan Beduk said Demirag had just begun
serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder when he fled the
low-security prison.
   Earlier, The Associated Press erroneously quoted Ozer as saying
Demirag was serving time for murder.
   Authorities had not established a motive for the attack, Ozer
said.
   Turkish news agencies reported responsibility claims from the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party and another group called The
Revolutionary Officers Organization.
   None of the claims could be confirmed independently.
   The Kurdish Labor Party is fighting for an independent Marxist
state in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey. About one-fifth
of Turkey's 52 million people are ethnic Kurds.
   The assassination attempt occurred three days after Ozal
returned from a historic visit to Greece, Turkey's longtime enemy.
   Police said Demirag, a schoolteacher, stayed in a hotel near the
convention hall under the name of Hayati Ipek on Friday night.
Beduk said police were investigating Demirag's possible political
affiliations.
   Police took into custody about 50 people, many of whom helped
decorate the convention hall, to determine whether any smuggled
Demirag's weapon into the building, Turkish news agencies reported.
   Police and witnesses said Demirag was standing a few yards from
the lectern in a group of news photographers when he fired. Beduk
said Demirag's gun jammed after he shot twice at Ozal.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli, a physician, quickly wrapped
a white cloth around Ozal's wound.
   As blood seeped through the bandage, Ozal returned to the
lectern and declared, ``No one can take away the life given by God
except God himself!''
   The crowd jumped to its feet and applauded.
   Ozal ducked behind the lectern when he heard the shots, the
Anatolia news agency said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengis Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
Ozal's hand through the right thumb and exited from the palm.
   The premier received three stitches and returned to the
convention hall three hours after the 12:15 p.m. attack. Later,
delegates re-elected Ozal chairman of the party. There were no
other candidates.
   Ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The Motherland Party was founded six months before elections in
November 1983 that restored civilian rule in Turkey.
   In general elections seven months ago, Ozal's party received 290
of the seats in the 450-seat legislature.
   But in recent months, Ozal's popularity waned because of
inflation, which is running at 75 percent. Recent public opinion
polls have showed support for him at 25 percent, down from the 36
percent of votes he received in the elections.
   In his speech Saturday, Ozal defended austerity measures put in
place to battle inflation. He pledged to cut inflation in half
within a year.
   The attack on Ozal came minutes after he stressed the importance
of political stability. He said that the last 10 years _ in which
political terrorism claimed 5,000 lives and prompted military
intervention in 1980 _ were a lost decade for Turkey.
   Beduk said that of the 16 bystanders wounded by gunfire, two
required surgery but were in satisfactory condition. Police didn't
say if they were hit by police gunfire.
   Ozal returned to Turkey on Wednesday from a three-day visit to
Greece, the first by a Turkish premier in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from the talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they were resolved to continue the dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus. In March 1987, Greece and
Turkey came to the brink of war over oil-drilling rights in the
Aegean seabed.
   One of the first messages of regret about Saturday's attack came
from Papandreou. In a telegram, the Greek leader said, ``I hope you
will continue your government's creative work and the no-war course
we initiated in our countries' bilateral relations with new energy
and health.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who is to pay a state visit
to Turkey next month, expressed ``deep shock'' at the attempt on
Ozal's life.
   ``Your calmness and fortitude in continuing your speech to the
Motherland Party congress was admirable,'' Gandhi said in a
statement issued in New Delhi.
