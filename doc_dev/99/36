AL MARTINEZ: A CITY IN SEARCH OF A PIT

I have been searching for a consistent moral standard in L.A. by asking people 
how they feel about pornography. Two were for it, three against it and one said 
she wouldn't talk dirty with a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two for it, one was a television producer and the other an autistic 
savant who could name dirty movies back to the time Hedy Lamar appeared nude in 
the film "Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
The reason I went out searching for some kind of moral level was a ruling last 
week by Judge David Kenyon that there is no obvious community standard in L.A. 
regarding moral filth. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he threw out a case against a distributor of adult videos. How can 
you judge a film to be pornographic, he asked, when everyone has a different 
idea of what pornography is? 
</P>
<P>
Size has a lot to do with it. In Argonia, Kan., for instance, with its 
population of 591, it would be easy to set a standard by declaring that 
anything your mother wouldn't approve of is dirty, and those who don't agree 
with that get out. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, with its 13 million drifting souls, some of whose mothers 
are topless dancers, taste varies to such a degree that what is slime to some 
is chicken soup to others. 
</P>
<P>
One of those I spoke with in pursuit of a definition was the Rev. Jess Moody, 
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys and God's best friend in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A wily Texan who has parlayed down-home charm and an Oxford education into 
leadership of 10,000 parishioners, Jess once claimed to have discussed with God 
the possibility of moving his church from Van Nuys to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
God said go for it, but the neighbors raised such hell that God changed his 
mind and said maybe you shouldn't go for it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has talked to God, however, is worth listening to, so I asked Jess 
how he felt about moral filth. Asking a pastor how he feels about smut is like 
asking a cat how he feels about being chased by a dog. While the dog might 
consider it fun, it's not going to please the cat. 
</P>
<P>
Jess came at me quoting the Bible, the Supreme Court, three teachers, a writer 
and his daddy to support his argument that Judge Kenyon should have set the 
community standard himself rather than leaving it up to the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is a free-floating relativist," Moody declared with just enough fire 
and brimstone in his voice to indicate he was not fooling around. "He ought to 
be a ticket-taker at Dodger Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
I was about to ask what a relativist was, but you don't goad a preacher on the 
pulpit. Anyhow, he was beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what you get when you let people decide the law?" he demanded. "You 
get Jesus crucified and Plato forced to take Hemlock." 
</P>
<P>
He defined Californians as not being discriminating when it comes to 
pornography. Too many of us like it. 
</P>
<P>
"He who digs a pit will fall into it," Jess said quoting from the Book of 
Proverbs. Then he added cheerfully, "That ought to hold you for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to say anything to upset the ACLU and, God knows, I'd rather die 
than appear unhip, but there does seem to be a lot of hot sex going on and it 
isn't very subtle. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, for instance, a movie, to indicate human fornication, would 
portray a man and a woman in decent swimming attire kissing on a beach and then 
pan away to sea gulls when the breathing got heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Violins played while the sea gulls soared and sometime there was brass section 
fortissimo at the proper moment, but that was generally that. 
</P>
<P>
Now the camera dollies in for the kind of tight shots that would make a gunnery 
sergeant blush and follows the couple scene after scene as they repeat the 
performance on a roller coaster, a kitchen table, halfway up the steps of the 
Jefferson Memorial and in the middle of the Piazza San Pietro. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the R-rated stuff. Take the same scenes, add horses, whips, 
handcuffs and a guillotine and you've got what the porn kings are peddling on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenyon and Jess Moody are both a little bit right. I agree that Mom may 
not be capable of setting a single moral standard for L.A., but it does seem to 
me we ought to be panning away to the sea gulls at least once in awhile.
