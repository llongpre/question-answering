  [Text] Ankara, Dec.11 (AA) -- Turkey is following the oil 
exploration activities of Greece in the open seas of Aegean 
island Thasos, very closely. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said today that waters 4-5 km west 
to the Thasos island are not among the disputed regions between 
the two countries. 
  The Greek Government had announced that it might carry out 
further drilling activities in the Aegean if the current 
explorations yield a positive result. 
  Turkey is closely following these activities so that they 
are 
not expanded to the disputed areas determined in the Bern 
Agreement of 1976 on the two countries' continental shelf. 
  Under the Bern Agreement both countries had ended their 
explorations in disputed waters of the Aegean. 
  Athens had filed a complaint before the International Court 
of Justice in the Hague and the U.N. Security Council against 
Turkey which began exploring oil in the Aegean, after Greece. 
  As Greece sought the approval of these bodies to declare the 
Aegean as a Greek sea, the International Court of Justice had, 
in 1976, called on for a Turkish-Greek dialogue to resolve the 
matter. 
  Turkish and Greek officials which came together in November 
1976 had taken conciliating steps in resolving the continental 
shelf matter. 
  The continental shelf issue was aggravated by the new PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government of Greece in 1981 
and Premier Andreas Papandreou has ended the talks.
