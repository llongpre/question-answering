Greece...."] 
  [Text] Yesterday, I discussed Greek claims over the Aegean 
continental shelf. Let us expand the issue now and move south. 
The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are 
waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason 
is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast, 
while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks 
get the entire island -- and that is what lies behind the plans 
for a so-called federation -- they will consider it a continent 
and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial 
waters. As a result, Turkish ships will not be allowed in the 
sea traffic from the Canakkale Strait to Iskenderun Bay. This 
is the equivalent of strangling someone. 
  The Greeks would not be satisfied if we agreed to a 
federation in Cyprus, if we granted state status to the Fener 
Patriarchate, if we installed church bells in the St. Sophie 
Museum, and if we even gave them Istanbul and Izmir. Little by 
little, they are tightening the circle around us. On one side, 
they are establishing a close friendship with Syria and Egypt 
and trying to form another hostile front against us from the 
south; on the other hand, they are supporting the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] and trying to get their hands on our 
southeastern borders. Furthermore, they are trying to establish 
a partnership with the Slavic states such as the Russian 
Federation, Bulgaria, and the new Yugoslavia. These states have 
their eyes on us and have demands of their own from us. 
Therefore, they are more than willing to become partners in such 
a hostile front against us. This would leave Turkey totally 
surrounded by a ring of fire, and we would not be able to live 
on our land. 
  Please do not think that this is the script of an adventure 
film or an imaginary fear. It is just another one of the 
developments we have been repeatedly faced with throughout our 
history and from which we managed to extricate ourselves each 
time with God's help. It is not a new development. 
  I always say: Sooner or later, we will find ourselves in a 
confrontation with the Greeks. In fact, Greek foreign policy is 
based on enmity against Turkey and on war between Turkey and 
Greece. They are not afraid to repeat that incessantly. For 
now, they are coping with the issue through Cold War methods and 
diplomacy, because of the imbalance of power between us and 
because they have not yet solved their other foreign policy 
problems. For example, even if they share certain common 
aspects with Greece today, the Bulgarians have always had 
certain demands from that country. Let us not forget the 
incidents at the end of World War II. There is also the case of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
It is still a hot issue. The Greeks are afraid that if they 
ask FYROM "to unite against the common enemy," then FYROM will 
say: "Let us reach agreement on our own problem as well." 
  The imbalance of power between Turkey and Greece is obvious. 
Our population is 10 times greater than that of Greece. Greece 
cannot handle our ground forces. Furthermore, I do not think 
that Greece's big brothers in the West would do much more than 
say to it: "Good for you"; neither do I think they would run 
the risk of a new world war that would start in the Balkans. 
  Besides, from the legal point of view, we would be the right 
side in any Turkish-Greek confrontation. There are several 
logical reasons for that. It would be something like a 
"defensive war." 
  I hope my dear readers will not think that I am a warmonger. 
I am a peaceful person. When you are pushed against a wall, 
however, and people are trying to strangle you, there is nothing 
else you can do. 
  If that happens, how would the fact that both countries are 
NATO members affect the situation? Let us discuss this tomorrow.
