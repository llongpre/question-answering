<TEXT>     The electricity, brought by underwater cable from the nearby island of
Mykonos, was turned on at a ceremony attended by Deputy Premier Tzannis
Tzannetakis and other officials, the Athens News Agency reported.;   The
two-square-mile island is the smallest island in the Cycladic chain. Thousands
of tourists visit the ancient sanctuary of Apollo, but the island is inhabited
only by a handful of museum guards and the staff of a small hostel for
archaeologists.;   It was once the political and religious center of the
Aegean, with a large population and with thousands of pilgrims visiting the
oracle of Apollo.;   Apollo was one of the 12 Olympian gods of the ancient
Greeks. Their chief god was Zeus and mythology holds that the gods lived on
Mount Olympus in central Greece.  </TEXT>
