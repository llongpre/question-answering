Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For more than five months -- from the day of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
Aug. 2 to mid-January this year -- prayers for peace in the Middle East went
up everySunday in most of the world's churches. Talk about saturation,
pinpoint praying. This was it.;    And yet war came.;    Under the
circumstances it would be understandable if people lost their faith in prayer,
if not in God. No doubt some did. But a headline in USA Today three days after
the war began said, "War gives religions a big boost.";    For one Catholic
worshiper in Chicago, war meant only a shift of emphasis in his prayers.
"Before the war I was praying for peace," he said. "Now I am praying for a
decisive victory.";    Why do people go on praying even after events show that
their prayers "didn't work"?;    "It's possible God knows something we don't
know," said one woman, unaware of the humor if not the mild blasphemy of her
remark. "There may be some reason why he didn't answer our prayers.";    Some
people have an easier time coping with suffering if they believe there is a
reason for it. What could be more comforting than to know that God has his own
good reasons for this war, though they may be hidden from us now? "Farther
along we'll know all about it," we are told in the song. "Farther along we'll
understand why.";    If that is your belief, unanswered prayer is not a
problem. Then there are those who believe in a God who is all-loving but not
all-powerful. They pray not to a God whose hand directs the course of human
affairs but to a God whose everlasting arms enfold all his creatures as a
loving parent comforts a dear child in all circumstances of life.;    These
people too go on praying through the worst of times.;    There are other
questions a war raises.;    How can we keep our sanity and our humanity in a
seemingly insane, inhuman world?;    "If we permit every threatening anxiety
and menacing tension in this war to invade our inner life,we shall ultimately
break down," says one clergyman. "We must deliberately limit our mental and
emotional load.";    Our round-the-clock concentration on the war news -- what
a psychiatrist calls "our CNN mania" -- can be our undoing as we go home from
work each evening to "watch the war.";    In the words of one sociologist,
"There is a dreadful fascination about war. It provides excitement and
vicarious danger to lives that are otherwise boring and humdrum until it
becomes 'showtime' for our latest technological military inventions.";    As
we become absorbed in the number of enemy planes shot down and enemy
installations destroyed, we are in danger of losing our feeling for the
sacredness of all life that makes us human.;    Edwin McNeill Poteat wrote a
moving poem in World War II about a widow whose son had enlisted in the Navy.;
   One evening as she stepped outside to get the evening paper from the porch,
her eye fell across the headline: "Round One in Fight in Coral Sea is Ours."; 
  At the same moment she saw a Western Union messenger coming up the walk. She
opened the envelope he handed her and read the message: "I have the duty to
report your son missing in action in the Coral Sea.";    Poteat wrote:;    She
did not weep but thanked the boy and then / Fumbled a moment with the News
again. / She did not see the line that mocked her plight / And said, "Our
losses relatively light."  </TEXT>
