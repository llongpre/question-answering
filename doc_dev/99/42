MAGADAN, Soviet Union

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has never been a church in the entire Magadan region of the Soviet Far 
East, an area three times as big as California and with a population of 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a Russian Orthodox church is being built in the center of Magadan, a 
seaport on the Sea of Okhotsk that serves as the capital of the most 
Northeastern region of Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The church will stand next to a 60-foot-high memorial to the victims of 
Stalin's infamous prison camps. The memorial is scheduled to be completed by 
sculptor Ernst Neizvestny within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1930s the huge Magadan region remained virtually uninhabited except 
for nomadic reindeer herders and natives living in scattered villages along the 
coast of the Chukchi, East Siberian and Bering seas. 
</P>
<P>
Then Stalin started shipping hundreds of thousands of prisoners to the area. 
More than 100 camps of the Gulag system were erected and support communities 
were built around them. Everything in the region evolved around the prison 
camps from the 1930s through the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were an atheist nation there never was a reason to build churches 
here. It was the policy of our government to discourage belief in a god," 
explained Vyazheslav Kobets, the region's governor. "Of course, 
pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox churches still stand in many places in the 
Soviet Union. But they were never here." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a great deal of curiosity about religion everywhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors are besieged by Soviet citizens, some of whom have been 
lifelong atheists, for any information they can get on their views of God. It 
is part of ane emerging phenomenon of people searching for something to believe 
in now that they have lost faith and confidence in the Communist Party and 
their government. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 members of a medical expedition to the Magadan region, sponsored by the 
University of Alaska's Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, said Soviet 
doctors repeatedly asked them this summer if they believe in God and if they 
attend church. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the medical group included MDs, dentists, psychiatrists, hospital 
administrators, dental hygienists and physicians' assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"In one meeting when the subject of God was brought up, we asked the Soviet 
doctors what they believed in," said Anchorage psychiatrist Bill Richards, 49. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were brought up in the Communist system to be atheist and 
always taught not to believe in God, but to believe in the state rather than 
spiritual forces." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wandal Winn, 44, an Anchorage psychiatrist observed: "There is tremendous 
hunger in this country for ethics, morals and values to replace something they 
feel we have that they're missing. The Soviet people are in a vacuum, looking 
around for meaning in life. I have been asked by Soviet doctors if I had a 
Bible I could give them." 
</P>
<P>
Winn said he believes the Soviet Union "is fertile soil for fundamentalistic 
Christianity. I would not be surprised to see it coming on very strong."
