   Premier Turgut Ozal will become the first
Turkish prime minister in 36 years to go to Greece when he flies
there Monday on a historic visit to improve ties between the
archrivals.
   His trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in
major disputes dividing the two Aegean countries, but as one
high-level Turkish official remarked, ``The visit in itself is a
major achievement.''
   The last Turkish prime minister to go to Greece was Adnan
Menderes, later executed after a military coup. He paid a visit in
1952.
   For Ozal, 61, the trip is the realization of a goal declared
years ago. He said after coming to power in 1983 that he was
extending an olive branch to Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou and
was willing to meet him ``anywhere, any time.''
   He suggested that Turks and Greeks put off trying to solve major
conflicts and first establish a dialogue aimed at building
confidence, with cooperation in areas such as tourism.
   Ozal was the architect of Turkey's 1980 economic recovery
program, but was considered a novice in diplomacy at the start of
his term.
   The road to Athens opened when Papandreou, having rejected any
negotiations for seven years, pulled a surprise switch and agreed
to meet Ozal in Davos, Switzerland. At the meeting last January,
the two accepted a formula for improving relations founded
basically on Ozal's initial offer.
   The two NATO allies came to the brink of war in March 1987 over
oil exploration rights in the Aegean Sea, an event generally
believed to have given an impetus to dialogue.
   In Davos, Ozal and Papandreou declared their intention to avoid
war and decided to set up two committees, one political and the
other economic and technical, to start a process of negotiations.
   Since then the committees have each met once and Turkish Foreign
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has visited Athens, setting the stage for
Ozal's visit.
   In a memorandum the two sides pledged to reduce tensions in the
Aegean, cooperate in fighting terrorism and drug smuggling, and
refrain from provocative statements.
   Mayors of Athens and Istanbul exchanged visits. Greek Culture
Minister Melina Mercouri visited Turkey on a goodwill mission.
   Greek university presidents were invited and feted in Turkey,
and Turkish business people went to Athens to inquire about joint
ventures.
   Yet, the most intractable of their disputes _ over the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus _ still overshadows these modest
gains.
   Turkey boycotted a European Economic Community meeting in April
to protest the mention of the Cyprus problem in the opening
statement, a mention insisted upon by Greece, a full member of the
EEC.
   One key reason Ozal is out to improve ties with Greece is his
known desire to make Turkey a full member of the trading bloc by
the turn of the century.
   Many Turks still express apprehension about the Athens visit,
arguing that Ozal will come under pressure to make concessions on
Cyprus.
   Cyprus is divided into southern Greek and northern Turkish
sectors, where Turkish Cypriots declared independence in 1983. The
split came after Turkey invaded in 1974, prompted by an
Athens-backed coup on Cyprus.
   An estimated 20,000 Turkish troops guard the boundary dividing
Greek and Turkish Cyprus.
   Greek policy demands that these troops depart prior to a Cyprus
settlement. Turks say troop removal can only follow a settlement
which will protect equal political rights of Turkish Cypriots, one
fifth of Cyprus' total population of 750,000.
   In a recent interview with Turkish daily Milliyet, Ozal
declared, ``Not a single man can be withdrawn as long as there is
pressure on us.''
   He said he and Papandreou agreed to keep the Cyprus problem out
of the process of reconciliation, but conceded the issue will most
likely be raised ``privately'' in their talks.
   The other major problem, conflicting claims on the Aegean Sea,
is more complicated, but Turks hope that as a problem just between
themselves it can be more easily solved given time and good will.
   The Aegean sea is dotted by 3,000 Greek islands, many just a few
miles off Turkey. Turkey objects to militarization of the islands,
saying that is against international treaties.
