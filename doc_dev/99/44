Turkey could 'whip Greece' if the two Nato allies fight over rights in the
Aegean Sea, the Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, said on Turkish
television on Monday night. 'We don't want a reckoning. We know who will win
if there is one. We can whip Greece,' Mr Soysal said. He added that Turkey
was making military preparations but did not elaborate. 'If you want peace
you must be prepared for war,' he said quoting a Turkish saying. Greece
maintains it has a right to double its territorial waters to 12 nautical
miles but has no plans to do so. Turkey has said Greece's enforcement of a
12-mile limit would be reason for war. Many Greek islands are close to the
Turkish mainland and extension of Greek waters would effectively deny
Turkish boats access to the sea. The two countries backed down from the
brink of war over mineral rights in the Aegean Sea in 1987.
US assistant secretary of state John Shattuck yesterday voiced his 'greatly
heightened concern about the growing cycle of violence' in Turkey. During a
visit, he condemned the 'terror' of the Kurdish insurgency in the south-east
of the country but called on Turkey to seek a political, rather than
military, solution to the conflict.
