   On a clear day in Crete, the myth of
Daedalus and the reality of Kanellos Kanellopoulos drew uncannily
close.
   Daedulus was a mythical Greek hero who built wings from wax and
feathers and flew across the Aegean Sea. His son, Icarus, tried to
soar to the sun and fell into the sea.
   Kanellopoulos is a real Greek hero, a champion bicyclist who
likes to draw pictures of birds. On April 23, flying a fragile
airplane powered by pedals pushed by his powerful legs, he
duplicated Daedalus' feat.
   He flew farther than anyone else in a human-powered plane. But,
like Icarus, he has his sights on a goal he considers much loftier
than flying from one place to another.
   Two days after his feat, the tall, laconic Greek was training
for the Olympics in Seoul.
   ``It's true (the flight) was something different, but what I've
really wanted all along is to win a place for the Olympics,'' he
said.
   ``I was just lucky ... lucky to have my turn as pilot that day,
and lucky to accomplish the flight.''
   Kanellopoulos, a Greek cycling champion for 14 years and a
specialist in endurance events, has a reputation for coolness that
showed at the end of the 74-mile flight from Crete to Santorini.
   When the plane _ the Daedalus 88 _ crashed in the sea just 10
yards offshore, he stayed calm.
   ``I knew the job was done, so I unhooked my pedal clips and just
walked through the wreckage to the beach,'' he said.
   The 72-pound aircraft, built of hi-tech fiber compounds and
ultra-thin plastic sheeting, collapsed on impact.
   Kanellopoulos' flight took just three hours, 54 minutes at an
average speed of 18{ mph. It broke the record of 37.2 miles for
human-powered flight, set in January 1987 by Glenn Tremml, who
powered a Daedalus 88 prototype around Edward Air Force Base in
California. It also broke Bryan Allen's 1979 straight-line record
of 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   ``Kanellos is a really good athlete. By the end of the flight he
had his heart rate way down and he could have gone almost double
the distance,'' said Steve K. Bussolari, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology expert on human aerospace factors who headed flight
operations for the project.
   Kanellopoulos, who turned 31 two days after the flight, joined a
group of four American athlete-pilots in the United States last
year on the final six-month training period for the MIT project.
   ``He was exactly the right kind of athlete, a long-duration
cyclist who could produce a lot of power for his weight, and I
judged he had the temperament for a project that took patience,''
Bussolari said.
   For Kanellopoulos, human-powered flying was a challenge that
could be combined with his Olympic preparations.
   ``Learning to fly wasn't hard. And the training program wasn't
so different from what I was planning to do in Greece,'' he said.
   The other pilots described Kanellopoulos as a dedicated athlete
who quickly learned to handle the delicate Daedalus prototypes,
despite his 6-foot-2, 158-pound frame.
   ``Kanellos speaks good English and he learned real fast. He's
the biggest and strongest of us, and he sometimes had to ease off
the power so he didn't break the plane,'' said Tremml, 27, from New
Haven, Conn., one of the plane's pilots.
   ``Kanellos likes to play the cool tough guy, but I could see how
his knees were trembling when he was sitting in the plane waiting
to take off,'' Tremml added.
   In Athens, Kanellopoulos, a high-school physical education
teacher who works for the government sports secretariat, lives in a
small apartment at the Athens Olympic Stadium village.
   The Daedalus flight is unlikely to add to his renown.
   His gold medals at two successive Mediterranean Games were a
rare achievement for this small nation, which doesn't have the
resources to produce world-class sportsmen, despite its ancient
athletic tradition.
   Like many modern Greeks, Kanellopoulos takes the ancient glories
for granted.
   ``I first learned the Daedalus legend as a kid at school, but
then we're born with ancient ruins and mythology and we live with
them all the time, so they don't give us such strong feelings, ''
he said.
