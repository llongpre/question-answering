   BANIYAS, Israeli-annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli
archaeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its heyday
was the ancient world's equivalent of New York.
   Founded in about A.D. 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the
Great, ancient Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years
``into a huge city,'' archaeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the
Israel Antiquities Department recently said.
   ``We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000
people, which for those days means it was a New York,'' Tzarferis
said.
   Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center,
he said.
   Herod Philip chose the site near the source waters of the Jordan
River and next to a cave where pagans worshiped Pan, the goat-like
god of the shepherds. The cave is part of a national park that today
is a favorite site for picnics.
   He named his city in honor of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but it
became known as Caesarea Philipi to distinguish it from the port of
Caesarea constructed by his father on the Mediterranean Sea.
   American teams working at the site this year have partially
uncovered a dozen 30-foot-high arches that formed one side of what
appears to be a long shopping mall, said John Wilson, an archaeology
professor from Pepperdine College in Southern California.
   The arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history.
Wilson said Crusader conquerers 1,000 years later built a citadel on
top. In the 13th or 14th century Mameluke raiders from Egypt added a
palace.
   ``On top of it all was a Syrian village,'' Wilson said. Baniyas
was part of Syria until the Golan Heights region was taken by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981.
   Diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st century
and a 2nd or 3rd century house with mosaic floors, one of which is
largely intact.
   Wilson said ``we are encouraged there may be considerable
sections of ancient Baniyas that are preserved.'' But he estimated
it would take up to 10 years with as many as 100 people working each
digging season to expose a substantial part of the city.
   Historians and archeologists had many clues to the city's
location, Wilson said.
   ``The Pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on
coins of the 2nd and early 3rd century that say they are from
Baniyas,'' Wilson said. ``There are other coins with pictures of
buildings, which we feel are as accurate, and that's what we're
looking for.''
   The area is referred to as ``Paneon'' by the Jewish historian
Josephus, who says Herod the Great built a white stone temple to
Roman Emperor Augustus there.
   For years, it was strategically important because it controlled
the road from Damascus to the sea, Wilson said. It lost its
importance after Ottoman Turks took control, he said.
   In addition to Pepperdine, the other American colleges that sent
students to work at Baniyas this year were Averett College of
Danville, Va., and Hardin-Simmons University and Abilene Christian
College, both of Abilene, Texas.
