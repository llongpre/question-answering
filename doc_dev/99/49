<TEXT>  By John Barth; Little, Brown, 753 pp., $22.95; WHEN John Barth first emerged
on the literary scene in the 1960s with his bizarre writing style, the
response was electric. Large doses of sex, symbolism and wordplay-as-foreplay;
throwing verb tenses and first-to-third-person transitions to the winds;
dragging myths out of mothballs and tossing them into the lives of decent,
law-abiding (and Babbitt-boring) middle-Americans -- what was this balding,
stuffy-looking English prof doing to modern fiction?;    He was doing the same
thing (in such books as "Giles Goat-Boy," "The Floating Opera" and the
National Book Award-winning "Chimera"), with lots more fun, that Robert
Graves, John Fowles and Peter Shaffer were doing: He was stalking "mythos,"
dragging it back to the eastern seaboard, and unleashing it at the faculty
club amid the unsuspecting intelligentsia, so we could all laugh at how close
they really were (despite their pompous pretensions) to the true
mytho-ritualistic heart of darkness.;     This toying about with our own
primal roots, both literally and figuratively, is again Barth's theme in "The
Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor." Back to the umbilical labyrinth where
myths hang out (the book actually begins in the womb, where our hero is
chatting with his also-unborn twin sister, Bijou), we progress through many
"voyages" (relationships) of Simon William Behler, a once-popular "new
journalist" whose vogue has come and gone.;    After going down for the third
time in the Indian Ocean, Behler (pen-name: "Baylor" -- "I'm a natural-born
bailer! Get it?") surfaces in medieval times, 1,500 miles away in the Persian
Gulf. Fished out by pirates, he is dropped off at the house of the legendary
sailor Sindbad on the very eve when his host is entertaining a group of
venture capitalists lured there to finance his own next, and last, voyage.
While seducing Sindbad's young, nubile and debatably virginal daughter beneath
the noses of her father and a prospective bridegroom, Behler proposes a
storytelling contest to help secure his passage out of medieval Baghdad and
"back to the future.";    Here's where the problem surfaces. Our two narrators
(the second, Sindbad himself, spending each night in the tub that saved him)
are not the only ones doing a lot of bailing out. If this Sindbad suffered
under the literary constraints of his narrator, Scheherezade, he wouldn't last
until dawn -- much less to tell the tale of voyage six.;    I do not think, as
John Barth seems to, that his own writing style is as passe as we're told
Simon Behler's is. To the contrary; the Behler/Barth "modern" stories of a
young boy coming of age in a small town where he's expected to be "somebody"
are what bails out this book. These wonderful jewel-(bijou)-like flashes into
the life of a writer who wants to be an aviator (until he leaves the ground,)
who is "moored" (anchored) by two sisters named Moore at the beginning and end
of his life, whose spiritual/sexual awakening in Moorish Spain/Morocco leads
to his nearly being drowned by the anchor (moor) deployed by his
ball-and-chain wife . . . nobody does this sort of thing better than Barth.
It's a textbook in technique, for those who want to write great fiction.;   
Which makes us all wonder why he chose, for the counterpoint tales, to depart
from what he knows and does so well. Time magazine says that Barth turns
"daily life into mythology while turning mythology into domestic comedy," just
as "The Iliad" turns funny when it degenerates into a domestic squabble among
the gods. In short, the most ancient form of satire: pulling down the gods.;  
 But Sindbad is not a god, and the "Alf Layla Wa Layla" (1,000 Nights and 1
Night) is not ancient Western myth but medieval Eastern storytelling.
Admittedly it's hard to write a satire on a book that already is a satire; but
this doesn't explain why Barth's retelling of the Sindbad voyages lacks all
the adventure, excitement, color and downright fun of the oft-quoted,
heavily-annotated, 16-volume Sir Richard F. Burton translation of the same.
But then Burton spent so much time in the "souks" he was taken for a native,
while Barth sometimes confuses Moors, Persians and Arabs. (And why are all
those Islamic Iraqis swilling wine as if they'd never heard of Mohammed?) It's
juice, not Zeus, that's needed to get these stories off the ground.;    My
advice: Read the charming, touching, biting modern chapters and skip the rest.
Unless, like me, you like to figure out how a great writer can go from boring
to brilliant, all in the same wrapper. (box)  </TEXT>
