<TEXT>     The planet Neptune is named for the Roman god of the sea, known to the
ancient Greeks as Poseidon.;   Announcement by telegram; The six Neptunian
moons discovered by Voyager 2 were named Naiad and Galatea, both water nymphs;
Thalassa and Larissa, both lovers of Poseidon; Proteus, one of the god's sons;
and Despina, a daughter.;   The names were revealed this week in a telegram
issued by the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for
Astronomical Telegrams, a Cambridge, Mass., reporting agency for astronomy
discoveries.;   The IAU's executive committee voted to approve the names when
it met Aug. 2 in Buenos Aires, said astronomer Brian Marsden, the bureau's
director.;   Hidden in Saturn's rings; Saturn's newest moon, which the group
named Pan, was discovered hidden among the planet's rings by Mark Showalter, a
scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.;   Showalter found
the 12-mile-wide moon July 2, 1990, when he was analyzing pictures of Saturn
taken by Voyagers 1 and 2 when the twin spacecraft explored the planet in 1980
and 1981.;   Voyagers 1 and 2, laden with TV cameras and instruments, were
launched from Florida in 1977. They visited Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 2
explored Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.;   The two spacecraft discovered
at least 23 moons during their $865 million mission.;   Neptune now has eight
known moons. Two were discovered from Earth-based telescopes. One, Triton,
named for a son of Poseidon, is Neptune's largest satellite, measuring 1,680
miles wide, and was discovered in 1846. The other, Nereid, is 210 miles wide
and was discovered in 1949. Naiad, the smallest of the newly discovered moons,
is 35 miles wide.;   Saturn now has 18 known moons, 11 of which were
discovered by telescopes on Earth.  </TEXT>
