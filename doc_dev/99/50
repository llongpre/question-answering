<HEAD>Greece Will Take Part in One of Two Fall NATO Exercises</HEAD>

   Greece will boycott autumn NATO maneuvers
in the Aegean Sea but will join another alliance exercise in
Western Europe, the government said Tuesday.
   ``According to the government's firm policy, Greek forces do not
take part in (NATO) exercises in the Aegean,'' said government
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   He said Greece won't participate in the ``Display Determination
88'' maneuvers in the eastern Mediterranean this fall.
   But Greece will take part in the ``Autumn Forge 88'' exercises
since ``our armed forces do participate from time to time in
bilateral and multilateral technical exercises on a smaller scale
being carried out outside the Aegean,'' Kostopoulos said.
   Since 1981, Greece has refused to participate in NATO exercises
in the Aegean, saying the alliance favors Turkey by excluding the
Greek island of Lemnos from the exercise scenarios.
   Turkey claims that Lemnos should not be militarized, citing the
1923 Lausanne Treaty. Greece maintains the 1936 Montreux Convention
superseded the earlier treaty and allows military installations on
the northern Aegean island.
   Greece and Turkey have a long feud over military control of the
Aegean Sea region.
