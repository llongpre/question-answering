Joe Fay's combed color splotches have gone soft pastel. The color switch, 
coupled with his trademark cookie cutter silhouettes of cowboys, coyotes, 
leaping trout and bears makes for a weird, urban-sportsman's panache. It may be 
a move designed to confound intellectuals who like their art to look deadly 
serious, but it also knocks the pins from under pieces like "Bear and Bull 
Meadow" that try to a comment on the predator-prey relationship of survival.

Fay's mood here is overwhelmingly exultant. It's so up-beat we're unsure 
whether he's praising or parodying the city slicker who spends holidays as an 
"environmentalist" trapper, hunter, or fisherman. Confusion reads like 
irresolution, which is too bad. Irony is a terrible thing to waste.

Carm Goode's new, tiny expressionistic landscapes are dense, intensely 
conceptual paintings. As images they are juicy paintings of land and sea that 
play on the American landscape tradition, finding spiritual analogies in the 
beauty and desolation of nature. Explosions at sea, armored islands and 
hovering monoliths over figurative mesas suggest unsettling scenarios exuding a 
forbidding, philosophic fatalism.

The titles, with their paragraph-long explanatory notes, put all that into 
technical terms. The text links the paintings to Rupert Sheldrake's radical 
theory of genetic memory, detailed definitions of form and fragments of Greek 
mythology. This complex content demands a great deal from the viewer. The 
payoff is something of a gut-level understanding of evolution as a self 
propelled act of God. Art used to expound theory is always in danger of being 
tagged illustrative or simply dull. Goode's paintings aren't dull, but they 
could never get all the philosophy across without the text. And that's where 
the ideas get piled so high they become didactic. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La 
Brea Ave., to Oct.28)SUVAN GEER
