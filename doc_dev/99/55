   Metropolitan Museum gods were not amused when a
copy of their Zeus statue appeared at another New York museum,
adorned with a baseball bat and a futuristic G-string.
   An artistic and legal struggle ensued, followed by compromise.
The revised version, unveiled at the Whitney Museum Friday, was a
plain Zeus _ displayed with photos of his former self and signs
explaining the controversy.
   It all started in 1930, when the Met bought a bronze replica of
the Zeus, a famous relic from ancient Greece. Several years ago,
the Met loaned the Zeus to the Queens Museum, which in turn loaned
it to the Whitney.
   Enter Spanish-born artist Francesc Torres, whose work titled
``Oikonomos,'' the Greek word for economical, was commissioned for
the Whitney's Biennial Exhibition.
   Torres envisioned a Zeus that symbolized ``the economic
spectrum, the lowest and the highest: from guys who work at the
corner of Broadway and Houston cleaning windshields down to Wall
Street.''
   ``I wanted to use Zeus because, in Greek mythology, Zeus was the
chairman of the board,'' Torres said.
   This statue's right hand _ which traditionally holds a lightning
bolt or javelin _ was empty. So Torres added a baseball bat,
representing a threat to the economy.
   Torres pointed Zeus' left hand toward a video projection screen,
which showed a documentary of street people washing car windows for
change.
   Perhaps the crux of the matter was a 3{-inch video monitor. It
was hung from a piece of twine that was wrapped around the statue's
waist and looped around his genitals _ showing ``the chairman of
the board being hindered by his own power,'' said Torres.
   ``The monitor showed footage of the Stock Exchange from the
mezzanine. That was meshed with car racing material'' to compare a
car crash and the stock market crash, he said.
   The exhibit was opened April 27 and was seen by more than 25,500
visitors.
   On May 11, the Met's Department of Greek and Roman Art notified
the Whitney that it would take back its Zeus unless the
accoutrements were removed.
   The Whitney closed the Zeus gallery May 12, took pictures of it,
and opened the revised version Friday.
   ``It's preposterous but also very fitting, because the piece is
about power,'' Torres said. ``That's precisely what has generated
as a result _ a power backlash.''
   Dietrich von Bothmer, chairman of the Met's Department of Greek
and Roman Art, did not return calls for comment.
   But he told The New York Times earlier: ``Even if the statue is
a reproduction, it is a reproduction of a work of art. The image is
original. Adding material to it changes the intent and I still feel
that universally acknowledged masterpieces of ancient art should be
treated with the respect they deserve.''
   ``They're saying we have betrayed the original intent of the
artist. But who knows what the original intent of the artist was?''
Torres said. ``There is one small gratification I'm getting out of
this. I didn't think that in our blase world something like this
could create such an uproar. We haven't lost all the ammunition
after all.''
