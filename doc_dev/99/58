   Christina Onassis died of acute
pulmonary edema, or accumulation of fluid in her lungs, a judge said
Monday. Investigators reportedly were focusing on whether the Greek
heiress died from an overdose of barbiturates.
   Judge Juan Carlos Cardinali said the cause of death was included
in a partial report he received from forensic experts who performed
the autopsy on Miss Onassis following her death Saturday, apparently
of a heart attack.
   Heart attacks can cause the accumulation of fluid in the lungs,
or pulmonary edema.
   Medical examiners reportedly were looking into various possible
causes of death. Cardinali was quoted by the private news agency
Noticias Argentinas as saying investigators were focusing on the
possible ``excessive ingestion of barbiturates.''
   Family members and friends repeatedly have ruled out suicide.
   Three jars of medicine and other evidence found in Miss Onassis'
bedroom were taken by police Sunday for analysis, the private news
agency Diarios y Noticias reported Monday. Another bottle of pills
reportedly was missing.
   Miss Onassis, the 37-year-old daughter of Greek shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis, died at the country club home of close friends.
   One of three doctors who allegedly examined Miss Onassis at the
country club and pronounced her dead was questioned by police and
two judges who have jurisdiction in the case, Diaros y Noticias
reported.
   Miss Onassis frequently went on diets to combat a persistent
weight problem, and she was known to take diet pills. It was not
known if she was on diet pills at the time of her death.
   Tissues taken from Miss Onassis' body at an autopsy Saturday
still were being examined, Cardinali's secretary said in a telephone
interview.
   The full coroner's report was expected to be delivered to
Cardinali later Monday. It was unclear whether he would publicly
disclose its contents.
   The judge said he still is awaiting a determination on the cause
of the edema as well as results of a chemical analysis and other
pathological studies performed on the body.
   Miss Onassis was the stepdaughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
the widow of President John F. Kennedy who married Aristotle Onassis
in 1968.
   When her father died in 1975, Miss Onassis inherited half of the
family's estimated $1 billion fortune. The other half is controlled
by the Alexander Onassis Foundation, set up in memory of Onassis'
only son, Alexander, who died in a 1973 plane crash.
   Miss Onassis had four unsuccessful marriages. Her last husband,
French industrialist Thierry Roussel, arrived Monday from Geneva to
wrap up legal proceedings and accompany the body to Skorpios, the
Onassis family's island in the Ionian Sea off the northwest coast of
Greece.
   Roussel is the father of Miss Onassis' only child, 3-year-old
Athena, who stands to inherit her mother's entire fortune. Roussel
will have custody of the child until she comes of age.
   The newspaper Clarin reported Monday that Miss Onassis intended
within the next two weeks to marry Jorge Tchomlekdjoglou, brother of
her longtime friend and weekend host in Argentina, Marina Dodero.
   The newspaper cited sources it did not identify in Buenos Aires'
Greek community. Telephone calls placed to the homes of the Doderos,
the family Tchomlekdjoglou and Miss Onassis' aunt, Mary, were
unanswered.
   On Saturday, Miss Onassis was taken from Tortuguitas Country
Club, 25 miles north of the capital, to a private clinic and then to
Clinica del Sol Hospital in Buenos Aires, where she was pronounced
dead on arrival.
   Federal Judge Alberto Piotti, whose district includes Tortuguitas
Country Club, prohibited the removal of Miss Onassis' body from
Argentina without his authorization, citing ``errors of procedure''
in transfering the body from his district to Buenos Aires.
