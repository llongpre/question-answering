   Archaeologists have been excavating this
ancient oasis for more than 50 years, but it will take 30 more
before the full splendor of Palmyra's temples, tombs and colonnades
is restored.
   Lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green date-palms.
Hundreds more lie buried in the sand, along with piles of huge stone
blocks dating back 1,800 years to a time when Palmyra was the center
of a kingdom on desert caravan routes.
   ``If we brought in bulldozers, we could clear the site in six
months, but we'd also destroy much evidence needed to assess the
city's role in history,'' said archaeologist Khaled Assad, the site
director.
   ``Doing it slowly means another generation of work by Syrian and
foreign excavators. ... But we'll also be restoring as much of the
ancient city as possible.''
   Polish, French, West German, East German and Japanese
archaeologists are digging in different areas of Palmyra.
   Syria, where human habitation has been traced back 150,000 years,
is an archaeological treasure house of the remnants of countless
civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout its history.
   About half of ancient Palmyra, about 4{ square miles, has been
unearthed.
   It's Syria's top tourist attraction, drawing more than 70,000
visitors a year.
   Palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network of
caravan trails that carried silks and spices from eastern Asia
across the Roman province of Arabia to the Mediterranean.
   But its rebellious Queen Zenobia challenged Rome's authority. The
city was plundered in 272 A.D. after she was captured during a long
siege.
   ``Palmyra is a unique site. ... It's a great responsibility and
we have to look after it, restoring the architecture, bringing it
back to life,'' said Culture Minister Najar Attar.
   This year, conservators finished renovating a 3,000-seat
amphitheater overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays,
concerts and youth festivals will be staged.
   A tall arched portico forms the backdrop, flanked by deep-set
doorways and pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries.
   ``Palymra boasts very lively Roman architecture and its public
buildings are superbly planned,'' said Asif Bahnassi, a recently
retired director of antiquities who supervised the restoration.
   ``We've re-erected more than 150 columns as well as many masonry
blocks. ... You can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur.''
   When excavations started in the 1930s the villagers of Palmyra
lived in the ruins of the huge temple of Bel, the Babylonian
equivalent of Zeus, king of the Gods in Greek mythology.
   They were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30,000.
   The only modern building among the ruins is the 12-room Hotel
Zenobia dating from 1918, mentioned in many Middle East travelers'
memoirs.
   But it's unlikely to be torn down because ``it happens to stand
in the courtyard of a temple to the rain god Belshamin and doesn't
overlie anything important,'' Assad said.
   Last year, he said, Syrian archaeologists pulled 30 pieces ``of
really beautiful statuary'' from an underground tomb dated around 98
A.D.
   In that period, wealthy Palmyrenes buried their relatives in
family tombs decorated with portraits of the deceased in sculpture
and wall painting.
   The excavators are still looking for a likeness of Queen Zenobia.
   ``She doesn't appear in the archaeological record although we
have a good deal of information about her. ... Her career was
recorded in detail by Roman historians,'' Assad said.
   The site of her palace has been identified, but a later Roman
emperor, Diocletian, razed its remains and built a military camp
there some 30 years after the city was captured.
   In the 3rd century, Palmyra won tax breaks from the Romans that
helped boost its commercial importance.
   In addition to its markets for luxury goods, the city operated a
network of caravan hostelries at 15-mile intervals _ equivalent to a
day's journey. Palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in the
Persian Gulf.
   But Zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the city's
independence after her Arab husband, Odeinat, died.
   ``She was very ambitious for her son, Wahballat, but she was also
a strong personality in her own right,'' Assad said.
   Called ``the most beautiful woman in the Orient,'' she wore Roman
purple and addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor on
campaign. She followed political developments in Rome and hired a
Greek philosopher, Longinus, as an adviser.
   Zenobia was seized by the Romans near the Euphrates river, while
riding a camel to seek help against the Emperor Aurelian's siege of
Palmyra.
   According to some historians, she was taken to Rome where she
married a Roman senator and lived in a villa at Tivoli.
