   Down in the hill country of south Texas, a
craftsman with a fancy for symbolism pursues that ancient way of
conveying faith, expressing it in signs and images.
   They're myriad kinds _ a fish, circle, dove, Greek letters,
flames, a flower, anchor, crown, a cross.
   ``I had something I wanted to say that's important to me, and I
wanted to share it with others,'' says James Avery, 67, whose
company at Kerrville, Texas, turns out religiously symbolic jewelry.
   ``I know these things are strengthening to people,'' he said in a
telephone interview, telling of many letters received affirming it
and special requests for items in times of crisis.
   Pictorial art and symbols were _ until the 15th century invention
of the printing press _ the main representation for common people of
Christianity, registered in church sculptury, figures and mosaics.
   But in modern times, such indirect religious expression has
become less prominent, along with a shift away from decorative
churches, with the meaning of many symbols often not known.
   ``It's a sometimes forgotten, but powerful language,'' Avery said.
   However, his output of symbol-bearing pins, rings, pendants, key
chains, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and other items in silver and
gold has grown from a one-man shop in his garage to a $22
million-a-year business.
   It includes, besides his main design and hand-crafting center on
a tree-clad hillside at Kerrville, 22 retail stores, mostly in Texas
and Oklahoma, plus an extensive mail-order trade, and employs about
600 people.
   ``I didn't get into this to make money,'' he said, relating how
he turned to it at a stressful point in his own life to find a
simpler, more constructive way of living.
   At that time, the Milwaukee-born Avery, then a fine arts
professor at the University of Colorado, had been without religious
faith, his first marriage collapsed.
   ``It started me doing some pretty heavy thinking,'' he said. ``I
was trying to get back on a track with some values and that were
lasting.'' He returned to the Episcopal Church which he had
abandoned in his college days.
   Now a ``a very strong, committed Christian,'' he said:
   ``There is no help in us ourselves. It comes from the outside.
You can't stare at your navel and get it. It comes from without,
from God himself. That's where the healing and help comes from.''
   Settling in 1954 in Kerrville, northwest of San Antonio, he hung
a sign on his garage, ``James Avery Craftsman,'' the name of his
company ever since. He wasn't even sure then just what crafting he
would do.
   As a World War II Air Force bomber flier, while still an
agnositic, he had carried a charm given him by an African native who
said it would protect from ``boom, boom.'' He said he had prized it
then.
   Indirectly, it may have figured in his turning to crafting
religiously symbolic jewelry. At $2 an hour for his work, plus
materials, he took in only $5,500 the first year, but demand for his
pieces spread, mostly at first by word-of-mouth.
   Now bigtime, he said what mattered was the note of faith and
beauty in his pieces. ``This is where it's at. This is what living
is all about, what Christ was talking about, where freedom is.''
   His company's output includes 196 different types of Christian
crosses from various periods and areas of the world, plus many other
symbols. Each piece includes a card explaining the Scriptural or
historical meaning.
   Some symbols used in Avery's jewelry that aren't always clear
beforehand to people include:
   INRI _ Latin initials of inscription at the top of the cross at
the crucifixon, ``Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.''
   Butterfly _ eternal life; dove _ Holy Spirit; lily _ purity and
chastity; nail _ Christ's physical suffering; rose _ prophecy;
triangle _ the Trinity; crossed keys _ keys to heaven given to St.
Peter.
   Olive branch _ peace, God's reconciliation with man; shell _
baptism, recalling the scallop shell or scallop-shaped vessel used
in pouring baptismal water; lamb _ Jesus; anchor _ hope,
steadfastness.
   Chi Rho _ Greek initials of Christ, XP; circle _ eternity; flames
_ Holy Spirit, religious fervor, martyrdom; daisy _ Christ child,
innocence; grapes _Holy Communion; harp _ music glorifying God;
heart _ God's love.
   IHS _ first three Greek letters of Jesus, IHCOYC, but when Latin
became the main language, the Greek C was changed to a Latin S,
making the abbreviation IHS instead of IHC.
   Ichthus _ fish, in Greek, early symbol of Christ. Christianity
was an underground movement for its first 300 years, and Christians
would draw a fish as a secret sign of identity.
