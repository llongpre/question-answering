   Judges granted approval early
Wednesday to take the body of Greek heiress Christina Onassis out of
the country for burial on a Greek island.
   Family and friends were expected to pick up the casket at 8:30
a.m. at the archbishopric of the Greek Orthodox Church, where it has
lain since Saturday, the private news agency Diarios y Noticias said.
   The agency quoted unidentified government sources as saying
Federal Judge Alberto Piotti and other judges who had jurisdiction
in the case accepted Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia's request
that the proceeding be expedited to avoid diplomatic problems.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died suddenly on Saturday morning.
   A preliminary coroner's report on Monday said the cause of death
was acute pulmonary edema, or an accumulation of fluid in her lungs.
It did not say what caused the accumulation.
   Determination of the cause of death has held up delivery of Ms.
Onassis' body to family members, who intend to take it for burial in
a mausoleum on the family-owned island of Skorpios in the Ionian Sea.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million from
her father Aristotle, who died in 1975.
