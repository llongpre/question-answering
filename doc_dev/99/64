   Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis
today released pictures of three men allegedly involved in a
terrorist attack aboard a Greek cruise ship that left 11 people
dead and 98 injured.
   Government sources said today that a woman also was involved in
Monday's attack and was photographed on the ship. Her photograph
was not made public by Sehiotis, but also was being distributed to
airports, border entry points and harbors around Greece, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities had said three men hurled grenades and fired
automatic weapons Monday at terrified passengers aboard the City of
Poros cruise ship. Police said the assailants fled in a speedboat.
   Greek authorities speculated the attack was part of a failed
attempt by pro-Iranian Arab terrorists to hijack foreign tourists
taking a island-hopping cruise on the Greek-owned ship.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the assault. At least
one passenger said a gunman spoke what sounded like Arabic.
   Sehiotis indicated the ship attack was linked to an explosion
earlier Monday that killed two men in a rental car near the
Trocadero Marina, home marina for the City of Poros.
   Despite repeated questioning by Greek reporters, the minister
declined to give any more details other than the names of two
Lebanese men ``being sought as involved in this attack.''
   He identified them as Hamoud Abdul Hamid, 36, of Lebanon, who
rented the car and Mohammed Zozad, 21, thought to be one of the
terrorists on the ship. The minister said both had been in Greece
since May.
   A Piraeus harbor authority officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he believed the attack was staged by two men and
two women who boarded the cruise ship after it stopped at the
island of Aegina.
   He said survivors had recognized Zozad in the picture as well as
a young woman in another photograph taken aboard the ship. He did
not say if a picture was taken of the other woman or if the picture
of the other man was the same as that released by Greek officials.
   Rescuers today pulled a body from the Aegean Sea and a second
was found on the cruise ship. Nine bodies were recovered earlier,
and officials said the casualty count was expected to keep rising.
   ``We also have found some floating body remains that indicate
the death toll could go higher,'' said a harbor authority officer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ship attack occurred at 8:40 a.m., six hours after an
explosives-packed car blew up near the Trocadero Marina, police
said.
   Police said they found an Iranian magazine in the wrecked car.
They said the vehicle contained hand grenades and automatic weapons.
   Terrified passengers scurried for cover and leaped into the sea
when the gunmen hurled grenades and sprayed gunfire at the tourists
on the crowded vessel. The grenade blasts started a fire and a deck
collapsed aboard the ship.
   The ship, about 16 miles out, was returning to the Trocadero
Marina in the Athens port of Piraeus from a daylong cruise.
   Although the harbor authority reported some bodies may have not
been recovered, a Merchant Marine Ministry spokesman said all 471
passengers and 22 crew members had been accounted for today.
   The ministry said that 28 of the 98 originally reported as
wounded remained hospitalized today.
   By today, authorities had released the names of only two of the
dead: Antonis Demaizis, the ship's 45-year-old first mate, and a
Danish tourist, 33-year-old Karl Johan Grabas.
   ``I was on deck when I heard automatic fire,'' Jean Wogewda of
Lorient, France, said from his bed in a Piraeus hospital, where he
was recovering from gunshot wounds in both legs. ``I turned around
and was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my
leg.''
   Another French passenger, Andre Gelia, told reporters that ``a
thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair jumped up
from his seat ... and started yelling in what sounded like Arabic.
   Gelia said the gunman took a submachine gun out of his backpack
and fired it at passengers. ``Then he said a few more words in
Arabic, took out one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and
tossed them. That's all I remember,'' Gelia said.
   Pouring black smoke, the City of Poros steamed back to Piraeus.
   The ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the wounded included 34 French, 3 Jordanians, 3 Danes, 2
Britons, 2 Norwegians, 1 Moroccan, 1 Swiss and 1 Swede.
   Seven Americans were on the cruise, but none were among the
injured, he said.
   The ministry spokesman said the ship attack could be linked with
a trial starting in Greece on Wednesday of a Palestinian wanted in
the United States for allegedly bombing a Pan Am jetliner over
Hawaii in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager died in the blast and 15
people were injured.
   The Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at Athens Airport
last month. He is to be tried on charges of entering Greece on a
false passport, but the government has said it will consider a U.S.
request for his extradition.
   In October 1985, Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian
cruise ship Achille Lauro during a Mediterranean cruise. They
killed a 69-year-old American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer. Seven
Palestinians were convicted in the attack.
