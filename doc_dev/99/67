   A 2,000-foot-wide river of lava from
Kilauea Volcano destroyed another house Monday as it threatened to
bury and burn the center of this coastal community.
   Kilauea, the world's most active volcano, was pumping all of its
daily output of 650,000 cubic yards of molten rock into the
Kalapana area on Hawaii Island, and authorities had little hope the
community would survive.
   ``This is a massive glacier of lava, at least a quarter of a
mile wide, at least 10 to 40 feet high behind the front of the
flow,'' said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   Kilauea has destroyed 120 homes since its latest eruption began
Jan. 3, 1983, 44 of them in April.
   Lava was a quarter-mile from the Kalapana Store and Drive-In and
two churches in the town center, which Kim said could be overrun by
Tuesday at the earliest.
   Walter Yamaguchi, who built the store in 1974, said he was
content to leave the fate of his business in the hands of God and
the volcano goddess Pele.
   ``In fact, Madame Pele owns the whole place. So I believe in her
and I believe in God,'' the 82-year-old man said. ``I leave it up
to the good Lord whether I win. I leave it up to heaven.''
   Parishioners made plans to move the historic Star of the Sea
Church, which sits on an oceanfront lot in the direct path of the
lava. A trucking company volunteered to move the church for free.
Volunteers began removing the church's stained glass windows Friday.
   Robert Lippi, chief financial offer for the Roman Catholic
Diocese in Honolulu, said church officials would wait until lava
was certain to overrun the church before moving it.
   ``It looks pretty inevitable,'' he said.
   Leaders of Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church, located
across the street from Star of the Sea, said the church's structure
was rotten from termites and not worth saving.
   They said some artifacts and a church bell made in the 1800s
would be the only things salvaged.
