   Christmas Week 20 years ago was
transformed into a magic and memorable occasion by three American
a had embarked on man's first visit to explore
another world, the riskiest and deepest penetration yet into the
void of his universe.
   Apollo 8 was to circle the moon 10 times in 20 hours on Christmas
Eve and Christmas Day, gathering navigational, photographic and
spacecraft performance data vitally needed before Americans could
attempt to land on the moon in 1969.
   The Christmas-time launch was a coincidence of orbital mechanics.
The constantly-moving moon is in position to receive visitors from
Earth only three or four days each month.
   The spacecraft performed perfectly. The men inside did not fare
as well. All three experienced slight motion sickness, and Borman
suffered insomnia and 24-hour intestinal flu. The next day they felt
fine, and, looking out the window, they saw, for the first time, the
Earth in its entirety, from 200,000 miles away.
   Overwhelmed, they transmitted to the television screens of
millions of homes this spectacular view of a gleaming marble-like
sphere of blues and greens and browns and whites.
   ``You're looking at yourself,'' radioed Borman, acting as a tour
guide.
   ``What you're seeing is the Western Hemisphere. In the center,
just lower to the center, is South America, all the way down to Cape
Horn. I can see Baja California and the southwestern part of the
United States.''
   Lovell continued, describing royal-blue waters, bright white
clouds and brownish land areas. ``What I keep imagining is, if I'm
some lonely traveler from another planet, what I'd think of the
Earth at this altitude _ whether I think it would be inhabited or
not.''
   Those television pictures had an overwhelming impact, giving
humans a new perspective of their planet. Many felt more than ever
that Earth was a beautiful planet, worth working to save. The
picture of this lonely, delicate celestial body became a rallying
point for environmentalists worldwide.
   Minutes after the astronauts signed off the television show,
Apollo 8 raced into the ``equigravisphere,'' a twilight zone where
the gravitational pull of Earth and moon are equal. Now, less than
40,000 miles from the moon, Borman, Lovell and Anders did what no
human had done before. They came under the prime influence of the
moon's gravity.
   The spacecraft, its speed gradually falling during the outward
journey, was traveling only 2,200 mph. Early on Christmas Eve day,
when Mission Control gave the go-ahead for lunar orbit, the moon's
gravity tug had accelerated the speed to 5,800 mph, fast enough to
swing the ship back toward Earth if a braking rocket failed to slow
the craft to orbital speed.
   The spacecraft moved around to the moon's backside, cutting radio
contact with ground control. For 36 agonizing minutes, the world
waited. Was the engine firing a success? Not until the ship emerged
around the moon's edge was the answer known.
   ``We've got it!'' shouted a voice in Mission Control amid a
bedlam of cheers. ``Apollo 8 is in lunar orbit!''
   Lovell, the first to expound on the moon from only 70 miles
distant, said, ``It looks like plaster of Paris, a sort of grayish
beach sand.'' He had answered the first of many questions about that
alien body that had awed humans since their beginning.
   During the next 20 hours would come answers to many more.
Throughout the day, the astronauts snapped thousands of photographs
and motion pictures. In the first of two telecasts from lunar orbit,
they relayed pictures of a wild and wondrous landscape pitted with
massive craters.
   ``It looks like a vast, lonely, forbidding place, an expanse of
nothing ... clouds of pumice stone,'' Borman said.
   Lovell saw the distant Earth as ``a grand oasis in the big
vastness of space.''
   The moonmen surveyed and photographed all five of the prime sites
being considered for the first Apollo manned landing mission. They
practiced identifying and tracking lunar landmarks and discovered
new ones. By evening, the astronauts were tired but so buoyed by
their achievements that they expanded a telecast from a planned 15
minutes to 37 minutes.
   While their camera scanned the lunar desert, blinding in the
sunlight, forbidding in the shadow, and with an estimated half a
billion people watching, some already celebrating Christmas, Anders
said, ``For all the people on Earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a
message we would like to send you.''
   Silence fell over many households as, with the striking
television pictures as a backdrop, Anders began reading the story of
the creation from Genesis:
   ``In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth. And the
Earth was without form, and void and darkness were upon the face of
the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, `Let there be light.' And there was light. And God saw
the light and it was good. And God divided the light from darkness.''
   Lovell continued, ``And God called the light day. And the
darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the
first day. And God said, `Let there be a firmament,' and God made
the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament
from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And
God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning
were the second day.''
   From Borman: ``And God said, `Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together into one place. And let the dry land appear.' And
it was so. And God called the dry land Earth. And the gathering
together of the waters He called seas. And God saw that it was
good.''
   Then, the emotion of the day in his voice, Borman ended the
telecast, saying: ``And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with
good night, good luck, a merry Christmas, and God bless all of you,
all of you on the good Earth.''
