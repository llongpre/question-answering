   ``And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.''
So reads Exodus 11:8 about Moses in the Revised Standard Version of
the Bible. A new, clearer rendering reads, ``And in hot anger he
left Pharaoh.''
   That's a sample of the clarifying changes made in the New
Revised Standard Version reaching bookstores in May after 15 years
work by an interfaith team of Scripture scholars.
   Seeking greater accuracy, clarity and more natural, intelligible
and flowing English, the revision refines phrasing in what has been
America's most broadly endorsed version of Scripture, the RSV.
   That 38-year-old version holds approval of most major
Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations. It's
the first version to gain that common acceptance, says the Rev.
Gerald Knoff, veteran Christian educator.
   The revision of it, the NRSV, produced by a 30-member group of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish scholars,
draws on older original manuscripts for correctness and also
sharpens the English wording.
   ``Those that were sent went,'' reads Luke 19:32 in the old RSV,
but the NRSV puts it more smoothly, ``Those who were sent
departed.''
   An instance of greater precision is Amos 6:5, which in the old
wording cites those who ``like David invent for themselves
instruments of music.'' Now, it says those who ``like David
improvise on instruments of music.''
   The Rev. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton Theological Seminary, the
courtly and learned Bible scholar who headed the translation team,
calls the new version both ``the newest and oldest.''
   He said the aim was to be ``as literal as possible'' in adhering
to the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts but also ``as free as
necessary'' in making the meaning clear in graceful, understandable
English.
   The NRSV was produced under auspices of the National Council of
Churches, which also sparked production of the RSV in 1952. The
translation team worked without charge, unlike translators of many
other versions.
   Six different publishing companies are putting out various
editions of the revision, some including the deutero-canonical or
apocryphal books between the Old and New Testaments, as wanted by
some denominations.
   The Rev. Arthur O. Van Eck, head of the council's division of
education, calls the new revision a ``Bible for our time.''
   In keeping with growing liturgical usage, the revision replaces
the former uses of ``thee'' and ``thou'' in addressing God with
``you.'' Metzger noted the original texts use the same pronoun in
addressing God and people.
   Despite some pressures for more sexually inclusive terms,
Metzger said that was done only when the text allowed it concerning
people. Pronouns remain masculine in referring to God and Jesus.
   There was ``no tampering with the gender of deity,'' Metzger
said. ``God remains `Our Father,' and Jesus Christ is the `Son of
God'.''
   However, he said English, unlike Hebrew and Greek, lacks a
common-gender, third-person pronoun, leading to a masculine bias to
male pronouns about people in past translations although the
original text is more inclusive.
   For instance, in the RSV, John 2:l0 reads, ``Every man serves
the good wine first,'' but the text doesn't specify ``man''.
Consequently, the revision reads, ``Everone serves the good wine
first.''
   Other corrections of unnecessary masculine renderings include
Matthew 4:4, which in the RSV reads, ``Man does not live by bread
alone.'' ``One'' replaces ``Man'' in the revision.
   In the Song of Solomon, Metzger said that in the sentence, ``I
am black but beautiful,'' the conjunction, ``and'' replaces
``but,'' which had implied black isn't beautiful.
   He said the change also conforms with the usual translation of
the Hebrew word,``wa'' which 49 out of 50 times is translated as
``and,'' not ``but''.
   Samples of other changes:
   Deuteronomy 29:5 _ RSV _ ``Your sandals have not worn off your
feet.'' NRSV _ ``Your sandals have not worn out on your feet.''
   Hebrews 11:16 _ RSV _ ``God prepared for them a city.'' NRSV _
God prepared a city for them.''
   Psalm 50:9 _ RSV _ ``I will accept no bull from your house.''
NRSV _ ``I will not accept a bull from your house.''
   First Samuel 24:11 _ RSV _ ``Though you hunt my life to take it.
..'' NRSV _ ``Though you are hunting me to take my life...''
   Second Corinthians 6:11 _ RSV _ ``Our mouth is open to you,
Corinthians; our heart is wide.'' NRSV _ ``We have spoken frankly
to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you.''
   Psalm 98:8 _ RSV _ ``Let the hills sing for joy together.'' NRSV
_ ``Let the hills sing together for joy.''
