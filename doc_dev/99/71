   CUBA-SOVIET BARTER IMPERILED

   Cuba probably will lose its special one-year barter deal
to swap sugar for Soviet oil because of the sweeping
political changes in Moscow, analysts said.
   The arrangement, which replaced a five-year agreement in
January, appeared unlikely to be renewed, after Soviet
officials said they were re-examining their country's ties
with Cuba.
   The deal, in effect a subsidy, guarantees Cuba sales to
the Soviet Union of as much as four million tons of sugar
this year in exchange for oil. A preferential price three
times the current market level of 10 U.S. cents a pound was
said to be used to calculate the value of the deal for
Havana. Analysts said autonomous Soviet republics, under
Western pressure to reduce Cuban ties in exchange for food
aid, also are unlikely to continue the deal.
   The Soviet Union is the single biggest market for Cuban
sugar. Havana relies on sugar for about 80% of its export
revenue, the International Sugar Organization said, adding
that Cuban sugar sales to Eastern European nations, once
major customers, continue to fall.
                                                                                                       

   RUSSIAN EMBRACES KEEPING RUBLE
                                                                                                       

   The Russian republic's central bank chairman, Georgi
Matyhukhin, urged that the ruble remain the only currency in
the newly emerging Soviet Union. He cited "a large gap
between what the politicians in the seceding republics say
and what is economically realistic." The center's
disintegration has raised the possibility of the republics
printing their own money, which could complicate trade
between them and create inflationary pressure.
                                                                                                       

   FRANCE RESISTS MEAT FROM EAST
                                                                                                       

   European Community nations are expected to pressure France
in the next few weeks to drop its opposition to trade
concessions for Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. On
Friday, a number of smaller EC countries dropped their
objections to market-opening measures for textiles,
agriculture and steel. But France, the only holdout, refused
to allow in greater imports of East European meat, arguing
that the EC already faces a meat glut. The French said the EC
instead should finance sales of East European meat to the
Soviet Union.
                                                                                                       

   PARIS TRADE MART PLANNED
                                                                                                       

   Paris hopes to revive the Bercy wine warehouse district
between the Gare de Lyon railway station and the Seine by
building the world's first food and wine trade market. Part
of an ambitious project to transform the working-class area
into a European business center, the International Food and
Beverage Trade Mart aims to be a showroom for 1,000
agribusiness firms, starting in June 1993. The eight-story
building will stand by the Bastille Opera and Bercy stadium.
                                                                                                       

   SWEDES MOST HEAVILY TAXED
                                                                                                       

   Swedish workers and companies bear the heaviest tax burden
in the developed world, provisional 1990 data from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show.
Total tax revenue in Sweden was equal to 57.7% of gross
domestic product. Denmark ranked second with 48.8%. Of the 24
OECD countries, Turkey logged the lowest ratio at 30.2%. Tax
levels fell between 1988 and 1989 in 11 OECD countries and
rose in 13, but the trend has been downward in recent years.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE REACTOR SHUT DOWN
                                                                                                       

   A nuclear reactor at Kansai Electric Power Co. plant in
western Japan shut down automatically Friday after water in
its steam generator fell too low. Water loss can cause a core
meltdown. The No. 1 reactor at the Mihama plant in Fukui
state had resumed operating after lightning last Thursday
interrupted service briefly. The Friday incident was the
latest in a string of accidents and problems in Japan's
nuclear industry. The nation's worst nuclear accident
occurred in Mihama's No. 2 reactor in February.
                                                                                                       

   DOMESTIC HELP FOR EXPATRIATES
                                                                                                       

   Domestic services for Americans living abroad are
considered a necessity in about one-fourth of the countries
in the world, the Runzheimer International management
consulting firm said.
   Expatriates often must have housekeeping, driving,
cooking, shopping, gardening and security services, depending
on local circumstances or conditions.
   Typically, pollution or unsanitary conditions can require
more housework. Travel restrictions may be in effect. Food
preparation may be complicated, such as soaking fresh produce
in antiseptics or boiling and filtering drinking water.
Language and cultural barriers can cause shopping
difficulties. Climate may be extreme. Security may be
required for accepting deliveries or supervising repairs.
Babysitters might be unavailable.
   Expatriates sometimes hire more domestic help than needed
because of its low cost, Rochester, Wis.-based Runzheimer
said. In Cairo, a full-time, live-in nanny can be hired for
about $1,000 a year, and in Bangkok, a live-in maid or cook
for less than $1,400 annually.

   South Korea and Mongolia have initialed an aviation
agreement, to be signed in late October, allowing their
airlines to inaugurate flights between the two countries. . .
. Electricity has arrived where the god of light was born.
Power is being sent by underwater cable from Kykonos island
in Greece to nearby Delos, a two-square-mile tourist
attraction in the Aegean Sea and the mythological birthplace
of Apollo, one of the 12 Olympian gods of the ancient Greeks.
