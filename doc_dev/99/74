   Iranian gunboats struck a
Liberian-registered tanker in the Persian Gulf today and returned
twice more to attack it after the captain called for help from U.S.
warships, gulf-based shipping executives said.
   The U.S. missile frigate Robert G. Bradley responded to the
distress signal but did not confront the raiders, U.S. officials
said.
   The shipping executives identified the targeted vessel as the
85,989-ton Sea Victory, operated by the Piraeus, Greece-based
European Navigation Inc. They said the captain put out his distress
signal at about 2 p.m. and gave his location as five miles south of
Farsi island. The captain said the attack was carried out by two
Iranian gunboats.
   He was heard frantically shouting, ``American warship! Americans
warship!'' and within minutes he reported that the gunboats were
``returning to attack,'' said the executives who monitored the
radio calls.
   The captain was still shouting for help when the gunboats
returned a third time to raid the vessel, said the executives. They
said the attacks occurred within about 15 minutes.
   The attacks caused a fire, which the crew extinguished.
   In a radio telephone contact after the Iranians turned back, the
captain was overheard by monitors as saying the Iranians attacked
three times, and he described the condition of his ship as covered
with ``lots of holes.''
   He was overheard saying ``no casualties, thank God,'' but he
also said that his second officer suffered minor injuries.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said in a statement that the tanker
issued a call for help but was able to steam west under its own
power. When it reached international waters, it no longer required
assistance, the statement said.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman in the gulf, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the frigate Robert G. Bradley was on patrol in the
gulf more than 20 miles away and responded to the call and headed
toward the tanker.
   The Iranian gunboats did not pursue the tanker into
international waters, said the spokesman.
   The shipping executives, who also spoke on condition they not be
named, noted that the U.S. warship would not cross the 12-mile
territorial limit around Farsi, which would be Iranian waters.
   Under the existing rules of engagement for the Navy, vessels in
distress can be assisted only in international waters.
   Since May 3, the Navy rules of engagement have been expanded to
permit U.S. warships to intervene to stop attacks on neutral
shipping in international waters, if the ships under attack are not
carrying war-related materials and if they ask for assistance.
   It was the second raid by the Iranian gunboats in four days on a
tanker in the vicinity of Farsi, a stronghold for Iran's
paramilitary Revolutionary Guards.
   About 550 commercial vessels of different nationalities have
been caught in the tanker war. Iraq attacks ships sailing in
Iranian waters and Iran retaliates by raiding neutral shipping,
particularly vessels linked to Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
   Iran accuses the two countries of aiding Iraq, its foe in the
nearly 8-year-old war.
   On Tuesday, the Iranian gunboats raided a Panamanian-registered
tanker, the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, about 20 miles off Farsi,
setting its engine room ablaze and causing extensive flooding.
   The missile frigate Nicholas, on patrol in the area, had rushed
to the assistance of the vessel and two of its helicopters took
fire from the raiding gunboats. No casualties were reported.
   The raids on the Universal Monarch and the Sea Victory were
Iran's apparent retaliations for Iraqi strikes on two tankers _ the
Greek-owned Fellowship L and the Cypriot Star Ray _ a few days
earlier in the vicinity of Iran's vital Kharg Island oil terminal,
also in the northern part of the gulf.
