<F P=106> [Ugur Sefkat report: "A `War Briefing' by the General </F>
Staff"] 
  [Excerpts] Ankara--The tension Greece has created by its 
wish to further fortify the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea in 
contravention of international agreements has set Turkey into 
action. The General Staff arranged a `war briefing' for 
President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on 
Turkey's new concept of threats yesterday. It has been 
ascertained that President Demirel asked for the surprise 
briefing, which was held in the General Staff Headquarters. 
[passage omitted] 
  It was stressed at the briefing that the possibility of a 
threat from Greece has strengthened, particularly after Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou came to power in that country, and 
that the question of rearming the islands in the Aegean Sea has 
confirmed that state of affairs. It was also stressed that 
two-thirds of the Turkish Armed Forces' fighting personnel have 
been assigned to combat the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] in 
southeastern Turkey, and that this state of affairs has created 
a significant vacuum in the defense of the Aegean and Thrace 
regions. The officials at the briefing explained that shortages 
were mostly observed in the ground forces but not in the Air 
Force units and the Navy. They also explained that the struggle 
against the PKK has used up some military stocks, and that most 
of the resources of the Ground Forces Command have been 
transferred to the General Command of the Gendarmerie Forces to 
be used in the struggle against the PKK. That, they said, has 
created several logistical problems.
