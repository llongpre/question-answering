   Sigurd Fafnerbane thrust his sword into
the dragon, roasted its heart over an open fire and rode away with
the gold.
   So goes a Swedish legend carved on a runestone in Eskilstuna. It
will probably survive for generations to come, if only because the
massive stone is too big to steal.
   However, archaeological experts are worried about other
runestones.
   ``More and more runestones are getting stolen,'' said Jan Peder
Lamm of the National Historical Museum. ``They are incredibly badly
watched, but then nobody could ever imagine anyone would want to
steal them.''
   The stones get their name from runes, ancient characters used in
Teutonic, Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian inscriptions, believed to
date back about 1,700 years.
   Myths, poems and the first traces of national history appear on
3,500 known runestones scattered over the Swedish countryside.
   ``The collector's value, or rather the value of curiosity, is
booming,'' said Lamm.
   Lamm said it was impossible to estimate the worth of a runestone
because there has never been a market for them. Many of the missing
stones are actually fragments, which have lain undisturbed for
centuries in pastures and churchyards.
   An entire stone can weigh nearly a ton.
   The extent of the thefts is also impossible to determine, Lamm
said, because authorities do not have the money or personnel to
conduct a detailed search.
   ``We just recently realized that they were disappearing,'' said
Lamm.
   The newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported recently that three
historically valuable fragments from about the year 1000 were
missing from a church on the island of Oland. Stones and other
artifacts have also been taken from an unguarded collection at Vreta
Cloister in southeastern Sweden.
   ``Every runstone is registered and well-documented,'' Lamm said.
``So from a scientific point of view, it is no catastrophe if they
are stolen. We have all the information down on computers.''
   He added, however, that the situation is still serious.
   Trading in runestones is illegal.
   ``They are public property, and this year we further tightened
the laws. But I believe many people break the law without knowing,''
by picking up fragments, Lamm said.
   Runestones are still turning up. In the latest find in September,
a mammoth stone uncovered in a churchyard on the Baltic island of
Gotland recorded the westward travel of the Vikings.
   The elaborately carved inscription says: ``Vatar and Hailgair
erected the stone after Helge, their father. He went westwards with
the Vikings.''
   The mushroom-shaped 1,500-pound stone depicts a Christian cross
and mythological symbols, which indicate that it was carved during
the transition to Christianity around 1,000 years ago.
   Rune writers were Sweden's first artists to sign their works and
the first national poets. One stone says:
   ``He stood like a man
   ``In the stem of the ship.
   ``He lies in the west.''
   The oldest stones often depict carved scenes from mythology, with
ships in battle and Norse gods in combat with dragons.
   On a typical stone, a caption is inscribed on the back of the
giant mythical Midgard snake, whose body twists around the edge of
the stone's flattened surface. Legend says that Judgment Day will
come when the god Thor strikes the snake dead with his hammer.
   Helmer Gustavson of the Central Board of National Antiquities
said runes also were carved on wood, jewelry or weapons.
   Sometimes they only identified the owner: ``Tova owns me.''
Others invoked supernatural power on a spear or a knife.
   Experts disagree over the origin of the letters, but ancient
legends say the runic characters were a gift of the god Odin, the
chief Nordic deity.
   Runestones kept oral legends from disappearing and opened a world
of ancient literature.
   A ninth-century stone called Rokstenen is the most famous
literary find. On it, a father tells of a son slain in battle. He
illustrates the story with heroic tales and songs.
   Carvings line the foreign routes of the long spring voyages, when
swift ships carried Vikings over the known and unknown world.
   Viking graffiti decorate a marble lion that once guarded the
Greek port of Piraeus and a church wall in Constantinople, now
Istanbul in Turkey, said Gustavson of the antiquities board.
   ``With Christianity, the voyages become scarcer and Latin slowly
overtook the runic alphabet.''
   Runes are still taught in Swedish schools.
   Gustavson said he once saw a modern variant on a rock by a
Stockholm lake. A couple in the 1950s carved: ``Ulla and Per tented
here.''
