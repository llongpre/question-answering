<F P=106> [Teymuraz Mamaladze report: "Black Sea Fleet Incident Could </F>
Escalate Into Armed Conflict"] 
  [Text] The much-loved naval game of tug-of-war has 
currently taken on threatening overtones in Crimea and the Black 
Sea Fleet. The style of the reporting on the attempted detention 
of the hydrographic vessel Cheleken would have been reminiscent 
of a pirate novel -- had not means been used which were not even 
dreamed of in the days of the "Jolly Roger." The missile-armed 
Su-15 ground-attack aircraft scrambled by the Ukrainian Air 
Defense forces and the high-speed cutters of the Ukrainian 
Border Guards which tracked the ship belong more to a modern 
armed conflict -- which is all the more likely because a Black 
Sea Fleet battle group came out to escort the Cheleken. 
  This time, it seems, God was merciful, or some naval 
official 
had second thoughts. Talks began in Kiev. It blew over. Will 
it blow over the next time, when it is not a taut rope but 
someone's nerves that crack? 
  This protracted Black Sea tug-of-war contest, in which the 
"teams" are battling for the prize of the property and status of 
the Black Sea Fleet units, is accompanied by an exhausting war 
of nerves, largely provoked by the sides' press centers and the 
mass media. Those who claim that unchecked and often concocted 
information (disinformation) works like a slow-burning fuse are 
absolutely right. As Emil Pain, member of the Presidential 
Council, stated in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
the appearance in the mass media of Black Sea Fleet situation 
reports that often fail to accord with reality excessively 
aggravates the situation. The demand that any report from the 
region be carefully checked out is undoubtedly correct. The 
trouble, though, is that the speed at which "disinformation" can 
be verified may not coincide with the firing speed of multiple 
rocket launchers. 
  The sides are disseminating mutually exclusive versions of 
events. It seems as though these versions, numbered with 
different figures and painted in different national colors, are 
becoming a kind of infection typical of this time of conflict. 
The news fabric is being woven out of scraps, each of which has 
its own message at odds with the others. Public opinion is 
disoriented. These clashing versions are striking the spark that 
may cause the explosion, after which people will no longer ask 
who gave the order. Before that happens, we should ask who is 
fabricating these explosive reports and to what end. 
  The incident of the Cheleken and the 318th Division of ships 
of the Black Sea Fleet reserve prompts us for the umpteenth time 
to consider the existence of a shadowy influence on big-time 
politics. After all, it is quite obvious that this latest 
"contest" was organized in circumvention and behind the backs of 
the top "referees" -- the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, and 
their agreement to refrain from unilateral action over the Black 
Sea Fleet. People have tried to cut down with the ax of shadowy 
schemes what was written with the pen in Yalta and Massandra. 
As one learned expert on the question has written, there still 
exists -- aside from the patent, obvious, and even specially 
presented picture of political life -- another, hidden intrigue 
of events that is inaccessible to the public gaze and controls. 
  Which in this instance is deadly dangerous. In this 
connection, here is another statement from a man to whom the 
dangerous games over the Black Sea Fleet are of interest since 
they pose a most serious threat to general peace: "A conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine could make events in Bosnia look like 
a Sunday-school picnic." (Richard Nixon).
