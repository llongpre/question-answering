   A human-powered aircraft built at Massachusetts Institute of Technology almost doubled the world's distance record for man-powered flight in a recreation of the flight of the mythological Greek inventor Daedalus. 
The craft, flown by Greek bicyclist Kanellos Kanellopoulos, flew 74 miles in 3 hours and 55 minutes Saturday over the Aegean Sea from Crete to the island of Santorini. 
The flight -- the subject of a recent article in The Wall Street Journal -- was made in a 69-pound aircraft developed over the past three years by engineers associated with MIT. 

   While approaching the Santorini landing site, the aircraft was caught by a gust of wind and crash-landed in the sea just short of the beach, according to reports by team members. 
Mr. Kanellopoulos, however, wasn't injured and made it to shore unassisted.
