IN 1492, as every schoolchild on either side of the Atlantic knows, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue and landed - second stop - on the shores of the island
that he christened Hispaniola. Almost 500 years later, Joaquin Balaguer,
president of the Dominican Republic, is set to milk the quincentenary for
all the political capital it is worth.
The organising committee claims the republic is the starting point for the
transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America.' The old
colonial quarter of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital, is
being renovated. Roads and bridges are being repaired. New tourist
facilities are being prepared for the 1m or more visitors expected for the
October celebrations.
In the biggest and costliest venture of all, the government is finally
completing the 60-year-old plans of former dictator Rafael Trujillo for a
mammoth Columbus lighthouse. This is meant to be the last resting place for
Columbus's bones and from the top it will project a 1m-candlepower crucifix
into the night sky. Pope John Paul II will be on hand to bless the
lighthouse when it is formally opened.
There are plenty of ironies here. The blind octogenarian President Balaguer
is responsible for lighting the light. The lighthouse that the Pope will
bless has been carved out of one of the capital's slums. And hundreds of
people have been displaced and scattered to provide room for the monument,
its vast grass surroundings and pools and fountains.
Yet when the lighthouse light has been switched on, all surrounding
electricity has frequently gone off, for up to four hours a time. Even
without the lighthouse, power cuts are frequent in the Dominican Republic.
The monument cannot be counted as one of the seven or even 77 or probably
even 777 wonders of the modern world. Do not start to think of the
lighthouse as a gracefully tall tower on the edge of land warning of rocks
and treacherous seas. There is nothing graceful about this hulk, a chunk of
gloomy grey concrete faced with marble and engraved with crosses. It is not
on the edge of the sea, and the only noteworthy landmark is the slum now
pushed 700 metres away.
I had expected to see some phallic monster. In fact, the Columbus lighthouse
is broader than it is long, covering two street blocks of the former slum.
It shows all the imagination of some communist functionary's dreams.
Of all the projects the Pope has blessed, this seems the hardest to justify
for a man of God or a man of compassion. At least the massive new basilica
at Yamassukro, in the Ivory Coast countryside, modelled on  - but bigger
than - St Peter's in Rome, could claim to be a monument to God as well as to
President Houphouet-Boigny.
Perhaps a stern Polish Pope will appreciate the austere grey outlines of the
Columbus lighthouse. But didn't his advisers ask awkward questions about a
cross on top of a lighthouse? Normally, a light warns ships to keep their
distance. Is the cross in the night sky meant to be a beacon or a warning to
the world?
Among other plans, the government of the Dominican Republic is going all out
to attract tourists. It has an eye on cruise-ships, which it hopes to
persuade to call at the rundown port where only a few rusting tramp ships
are now in evidence. It makes sense to a hard-pressed economy where tourism
is already the largest money-spinner, worth Dollars 800m last year.
But there is still a long way to go before anyone would rate Santo Domingo a
must destination, even on a sun-soaked cruise.
The old town has its nice points: some delicate old Spanish-style houses,
pretty squares, the house where Columbus's brother lived, the oldest
cathedral in the New World begun in 1596. But you can walk around it all
very quickly.
