   A Greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile
plane 74 miles over the Aegean sea Saturday and broke the world
record for human-powered flight, but the aircraft was destroyed in
a crash landing.
   A gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight Daedalus
88, which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing
area on the island of Santorini more than 3{ hours after leaving
the island of Crete.
   ``It happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was
done. I didn't worry about it,'' the athlete-pilot Kanellos
Kanellopoulos told a news conference in the Greek capital. He was
not injured in the crash.
   ``The situation in the landing area was too rough for this
plane, which is built for calm conditions. I was under full control
but the tail boom couldn't take the pressure,'' said Kanellopoulos,
who also broke the records for endurance and straight-line
human-powered flight.
   Kanellopoulos, 31, Greek cycling champion for the past 14 years,
was flown to Athens aboard an army helicopter shortly after the
rough landing near the black sands of Perissa beach on the
southeast face of the volcanic island also known as Thira.
   The 72-pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane, designed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, fell after hitting a wind
parallel to the beach, said MIT professor Mark Drela, who was in
one of the boats following the flight.
   But Drela, the senior engineer responsible for the plane's
aerodynamic design, said the project was ``definitely a success.''
   More than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the
beach to watch the plane, resembling an oversized insect, glide
toward the sand.
   The snapped tail boom caused the plane's huge 112-foot long
wings to break, dropping the pink-and-silver aircraft 10 feet into
the water.
   ``I was underwater so I forced my way through the cockpit and
dove under the plane. Then I swam to shore,'' the tanned, blond
cyclist said.
   Kanellopoulos pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for
3 hours and 54 minutes to fly from Heraklion air base to Santorini.
   He lifted off at 7:06 a.m. (12:06 a.m. EDT) and landed at 11:00
a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).
   The flight was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of
Daedalus, a Greek architect, sculptor and engineer who flapped his
way across the Aegean from Crete on wings of feathers and wax.
Daedalus' son, Icarus, flew too close to the sun, which melted the
wax, causing him to to fall to his death.
   The previous world record for human-powered flight was set by
the Light Eagle, a Daedalus 88 prototype piloted by Glenn Tremml,
who flew 37.2 miles around Edwards Air Base in California in
January 1987.
   Kanellopoulos also shattered the record for straight-line
human-powered flight set in 1979 by Bryan Allen, who pedaled the
Gossamer Albatross 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   The third record broken was for flight duration. The previous
mark was held by Allen, with a time of 2 hours, 49 minutes.
   Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue
craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the Aegean.
   The flight came after a 36-member team of MIT experts waited for
three weeks on the wind-swept island of Crete for a suitable day to
attempt the flight.
   Essential requirements were a calm sea, southerly winds of less
than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degress Fahrenheit and
visibility to the horizon, according to Steve K. Bussolari, an MIT
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations.
   ``Conditions for the flight were ideal. We even had a southerly
tailwind,'' Bussolari said.
   The southerly tailwind pushed the Daedalus 88 over the Agean
waters at a rate faster than expected by the MIT team, with the
plane averaging 18.5 miles per hour, team officials said. They had
not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per
hour.
   ``We were predicting the low speeds because we had been
estimating headwinds, which are prevalent. We have no idea where
the tailwinds came from,'' said project news director Ken Campbell.
   In addition to Kanellopoulos, three other athlete-pilots had
been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible
record flight.
   They were Francis Scioscia, 27, of Scranton, Pa., Greg Zack, 26,
of Wilmington, N.C., and 27-year-old Tremml, the former
world-record holder and a medical student from New Haven, Conn.
