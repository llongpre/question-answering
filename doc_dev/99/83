There's a line in Woody Allen's "God," a paraphrase of an old Hollywood maxim, 
that goes like this: "Theater is for entertainment. If you want to deliver a 
message, call Western Union." 
</P>
<P>
That's Woody being glib, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, after all, has throughout most of his career been the main man of the 
big-brain set, a comic who does deliver messages, along with the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
But that crack makes sense for "God," one of his earlier efforts apparently 
designed solely for yuks. Or, when it sinks in the corn, yucks. 
</P>
<P>
This frantic one-act isn't great Woody, but hey, even God got to rest on the 
seventh day. 
</P>
<P>
It has some moments, though, which the Orange Coast College Repertory Theatre 
Company tries to take advantage of in its outdoor on-campus production. 
</P>
<P>
The nervy, enthusiastic actors know they're hamming it up -- it's even 
acknowledged in the program, where everybody thanks "The William Shatner School 
of Acting" -- and the fun they have can be catching every now and then. 
</P>
<P>
All the horseplay is pretty self-indulgent, but since the comedy lasts only 
about 45 minutes and the sunny alfresco setting can be so pleasant, it's 
reasonably bearable. 
</P>
<P>
Director Eric Person keeps everything moving along, which helps, even when the 
cast almost speed-reads over the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the plot, centering on a chaotic play within a play that features 
ancient Greeks with names like Trichinosis and Hepatitis as well as appearances 
by Stanley Kowalski and Blanche DuBois, welcomes a speedy, elbow-in-the-ribs 
treatment.
