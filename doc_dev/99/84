   A member of Israel's Parliament arrived in
Athens on Friday to join Palestinian deportees in a planned voyage
back to Israel, but two organizers said they still had not obtained
a ship.
   The president of Greece's main seamen's union, meanwhile, said
Israeli agents had used threats and pressure to block the
PLO-sponsored trip that would carry 130 Palestians deported by
Israel to the Israeli port of Haifa.
   Union leader Antonis Dalakogiorgis also revealed that the
Israeli Sea Officers Union had warned they would boycott Greek
vessels if Greek seamen continued backing the PLO effort.
   The ``journey of return'' is designed to focus attention on
Israel's use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the
territories it captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Parliament member Mohammed Miari appeared at a news conference
at an Athens hotel alongside Bassam Abu Sharif, the chief spokesman
for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Miari, a member of the left-wing Progressive List for Peace,
said he was told that ``the Israeli government will put on trial
all those who participate in the trip,'' and said there were moves
in Parliament to strip him of his parliamentary immunity.
   Two other parliament members, Tawfiq Zaiad and Charlie Biton,
were among 11 Israelis who arrived Thursday in Cyprus to join the
voyage when it stops there. About 20 Israelis plan to make the trip.
   The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus, which tried
to take Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947 but was turned back by
British authorities. Miriam Algazi, one of the Israelis who arrived
in Cyprus on Thursday, also took part in the Exodus voyage.
   At the news conference, Miari backed ``the right of the deported
Palestinians people to return to their homeland.''
   He said he hoped the trip would ``open a new window for just
peace in the Middle East.''
   But there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to
sail soon, although the PLO has gathered hundreds of deportees,
observers and journalists in Athens and Cyprus to take part.
   Two members of the nine-member voyage steering committee in
Athens told The Associated Press that the PLO did not have a firm
contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed
out of tentative commitments.
   ``We don't have a boat yet,'' said Abdul-Jawad Saleh, the
deported mayor of the West Bank town of Bireh.
   ``There is not a concrete ship as of this moment,'' said another
member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity.
   The voyage was initially scheduled to start on Tuesday, but the
PLO diplomatic representative in Athens, Fouad Al-Bittar, said
Thursday the voyage had been delayed because ``many'' shipowners
had backed away from contracts.
   However, he then promised that the voyage would begin by early
Saturday morning from Greece's main Piraeus harbor, saying a boat
had been found.
   ``We are still insisting that the boat will sail,'' Abu Sharif
said Friday. He reaffirmed the time schedule given by Bittar, but
added an element of uncertainty.
   ``I'm sure we will find _ and have found, according to Mr.
Bittar _ a brave captain'' for the voyage, he said.
   Piraeus harbor authority officials said at noon Friday the PLO
had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship
can be brought in or out.
   Dalakogiorgis, president of the Panhellenic Union of Merchant
Seamen, said that ``Israeli agents'' had threatened Greek shipping
companies and individual seamen about the voyage.
   ``Seamen working on ships that the PLO might have chartered
received telephone threats from the Israelis and shipping companies
were also under intense pressure from them,'' Dalakogiorgis said.
   ``I personally received threatening phone calls, threatening my
life, not to proceed with this,'' Dalakogiorgis said.
   Dalakogiorgis distributed copies of a telex from the Israeli Sea
Officers Union saying ``we would have no choice but to boycott
Greek vessels in Israeli ports'' if the voyage goes as planned.
   No one from the Israeli union, headquartered in Haifa, could be
found for comment Friday.
   Shipping sources in Piraeus, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had
also been threatened.
   They said that Zannes Kouloumbis of the Maltese-flagged Silver
Paloma was warned of an Israeli attack during the voyage and told
his life was in danger.
   The ship's owners, who operate a regular ferry service to
Israel, dropped out.
