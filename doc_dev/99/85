   Gale force winds on Saturday forced six
Greeks paddling a papyrus boat across the Aegean Sea to abandon
their attempt to recreate a 10,000-year-old voyage.
   ``It is impossible for a boat six meters (20 feet) long to face
such weather conditions at a time when larger ships were forced to
return to safe harbors,'' the Hellenic Institute of Naval Tradition
said.
   The canoe-like boat, made of yellow papyrus stems lashed
together with rope, set off eight days ago from Lavrion, a port
near Athens, for the island of Melos. The 94-mile trip was expected
to take about nine days.
   The boat was forced to abandon its attempt 25 miles from Melos
at the Cycladic island of Serifos, the institute's announcement
said.
   The 5-foot-wide Papyrela _ Greek for papyrus _ was launched in
an effort to determine how Stone Age sailors could have reached the
island to obtain obsidian, a volcanic glass used to manufacture
cutting tools.
   Obsidian, found only on Melos, was discovered in a southern
Greek cave by U.S. archeologists in 1972. The material, which was
dated to around 8,000 B.C., was crafted into razor-sharp blades and
belonged to Mesolithic cave dwellers.
   The Greek boat was built on the island of Corfu using papyrus
clumps found at a nearby lake. It was patterned on a centuries-old
local design.
   Papyrus boats were used in ancient Egypt around 5,000 B.C. In
1969, a Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, tried to sail the Ra-I,
a boat built from the reeds, across the Atlantic.
   The Ra-I sank eight weeks and 3,000 miles into the journey, a
few hundred miles from the Caribbean. A later boat, the Ra-II,
successfully sailed from Safi, Morocco to the Bahamas in 1970.
   The institute said Saturday that it hoped to resume the voyage
when weather conditions improved.
   An escort ship that accompanied the boat was due to arrive
Sunday in Athens' port of Piraeus.
