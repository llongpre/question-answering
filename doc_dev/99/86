<LEADPARA>  ATTEMPTS have been made through the ages to identify God, ranging from the New
Testament's "God is love" to Thomas Aquinas' "First Cause" to theologian Paul
Tillich's "Ground of Being.";    Now comes an outpouring of homespun, modern
descriptions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "God is a kind word, a helping hand, forgiveness," says Joanne Stevenson, a
La Grange, Ill., saleswoman.;    Ellie Shepardson, a Berkeley attorney, says,
"Sometimes when I meditate, God comes up as my grandmother with a frying pan
in her hand.";    A tiny new book, "What Do We Mean When We Say God?" by
writer-researcher Deidre Sullivan and published by Doubleday, offers a wide
variety of contemporary American impressions.;    Some down-to-earth imagery
comes from Howard Weaver, editor of the Anchorage, Alaska, Daily News:;   
"Imagine there is this grasshopper sitting on a milkweed plant near the
railroad tracks in Montana. And the Great Northern Railroad goes by, the
Empire Builder, and it creates a huge ruckus and the milkweed starts to bounce
and bob and weave and the grasshopper looks around.;    "Does he know why it's
happening? He doesn't. And that is sort of the way I feel about God. There is
obviously something happening, but it is beyond my understanding.";   
Sullivan interviewed about 700 people and obtained responses from 5,000
others, in about a year's work of compiling the collection.;    It was pruned
down to about 200 views about God from people in various professions and with
varying degrees of belief.;    Gathering the material produced some odd
turnabouts in Sullivan's own attitude, first stimulating her own faith, but
later making it fade.;    Reared a Roman Catholic, Sullivan, 30, said she had
been an agnostic, doubtful about God, when she started the project, and
initially felt it had firmed up her belief.;    "I still feel basic Christian
truth is enormously worthwhile. But I see faith as a crutch," she says. "I
still have a lot of questions.";    There may be as many different notions
about God as there are people to wonder:;    Anne Williams, an Alpine, Utah,
telephone operator -- "God is truth. He created all truth. Truth to me is
things as they are, as they were, and as they will be.";    The Rev. Daniel
Martin, a Rye, N.Y., priest -- "The word 'god' comes from the Anglo-Saxon. It
means 'one who is greeted.' God is the mystery of life we greet . . . The
mystery is in everything. When we recognize it and try to put a word on it,
it's 'Hey!' ";    Science writer Isaac Asimov of New York -- "It seems to me
that God is a convenient invention of the human mind.";    Jungian analyst Joe
Wakefield of Austin, Texas -- "In linguistic terms, I think of God as a verb,
not a noun.";    Gabriel Green of the California town of Yucca Valley,
president of the Amalgamated Flying Saucer Clubs of America -- "God is the
electromagnetic field surrounding the Earth out of which everything is
composed.";    Mother York, chaplain in the Cook County Jail in Chicago --
"I'm just a light bulb, but there's a power line -- his name is God.";   
Other views are provided from notables of the past:;    Physicist Albert
Einstein -- "A superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience
represents my conception of God.";    Playwright Eugene O'Neill -- "Man is
born broken; he lives by mending. The grace of God is the glue.";    Greek
novelist Nikos Kazantzakis -- "God is a fire and you must walk on it . . .
dance on it. At that moment the fire will become cool water."  </TEXT>
