   A fragile pedal-plane skimmed across a
74-mile stretch of the Aegean Sea from Crete to this Greek island
today to break the world record for human-powered flight, despite a
crash-landing.
   The pink-and-silver Daedalus 88, piloted by Greek national
cycling champion Kanellos Kanellopoulos, dropped into the surf just
off the black sands of Perissa beach, on the southeast face of this
volcanic island, also known as Thira.
   ``I was expecting the takeoff to be horrible but it went off
great, especially with the tailwind. The most turbulent area was
here at the end,'' said Kanellopoulos, still wet after his landing.
   A strong headwind about 30 feet from the beach forced the
72-pound plane to crash-land.
   ``He tried to pull up on the joystick to elevate the plane to
turn parallel to the beach to deal with headwind and then a gust
hit the hovering plane,'' said Glenn Tremml, the former world
record holder.
   Tremml, who witnessed the landing said the sudden movement
``broke the tail boom and then the wings folded and he gently
floated down. He dove out and swam to the beach with a huge smile
on his face.''
   Kanellopoulos, 30, was not injured, said Charles Ball, spokesman
for the Massasschusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass., which sponsored the project.
   Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue
craft had escorted the plane as it cruised 15 feet above the Aegean.
   The 36-member MIT team had waited three weeks on windy Crete for
a suitable day to attempt the flight.
   Daedalus flew the distance from Crete's Heraklion military
airfield in 3 hours, 54 minutes, faster than anticipated, and
landed at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). Project organizers had estimated a
flight time of at least five hours at a speed of around 14 miles an
hour.
   Officials at Heraklion airport attributed the quicker flight to
a 3- to 4-knot tailwind.
   Daedalus 88 broke two records.
   First it shattered the mark for straight-line human-powered
flight set in 1979, when Bryan Allen pedaled the Gossamer Albatross
22.5 miles across the English Channel.
   Then it broke the world record for human-powered flight, set by
a Daedalus 88 prototype, Light Eagle, which flew 37.2 miles around
Edwards Air Base in California in January 1987.
   Kanellopoulos smiled at reporters as he waited for the all-clear
to take off in Crete.
   ``The flight belongs to MIT and Greece. We together are going to
realize and keep the myth. And of course this is the best way to
visit Santorini,'' he said as he was being sealed into the
ultra-light plane.
   Essential requirements for the flight were a calm sea, southerly
winds of less than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degrees and
visibility to the horizon, according to Steve K. Bussolari, an MIT
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations.
   The flight also was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth
of Daedalus, said to have flapped his way across the Aegean from
Crete on wings of feathers and wax. Daedalus landed safely but his
son Icarus flew too close to the sun. The wax of his wings melted
and he plummeted to the sea and drowned.
   Had the plane not made it, two similar backup planes would have
been assembled for another record flight attempt before mid-May,
when the weather turns too hot for human-powered flying.
   Three other athlete-pilots had been taking turns standing by for
48 hours each in readiness for a possible record flight.
   They are Francis Scioscia, 27, of Scranton, Pa., and Greg Zack,
26, of Wilmington, N.C., and Tremml, a 27-year-old New Haven, Conn.
medical student.
