   The government will demand abolishing a
U.S. Air Force base near Athens used to monitor Soviet fleet
movements in the Mediterranean Sea, an official said Wednesday.
   Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the base
will be dropped from a new operating agreement for American
military installations in Greece.
   ``One of the decisions reached by the Greek government is the
abolition of Hellenikon air base,'' he said.
   Kostopoulos' statement, which caught Western diplomats here by
surprise, conflicted with a background briefing given by a senior
Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday. The official said Hellenikon
base might remain open.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the United States had not received formal notification of closure
of Hellenikon base and would not comment on it. A spokeswoman for
the U.S. Embassy in Athens also refused to comment.
   Greek and American officials are negotiating a new U.S. bases
agreement to replace an existing five-year accord that expires at
the end of December.
   However, the talks have faltered over Greek efforts to link them
with its longstanding disputes with Turkey. American officials have
refused to connect the two issues.
   Kostopoulos also dismissed reports that Hellenikon air base,
next to Athens Airport, might be transferred to another location or
simply merged with another American base on the southern Aegean
island of Crete.
   ``In no way does the abolition of this base mean a transfer to
Crete and specifically Souda Bay or any other location on the
island,'' he said.
   The United States maintains a Sixth Fleet supply base in Souda
Bay and an Air Force communications station in Gournes, also on
Crete.
   Hellenikon, 10 miles from Athens, is a support base used by
reconnaisance planes to monitor Soviet fleet movements in the
eastern Mediterranean. It is one of four U.S. bases operating in
Greece since the early 1950s.
   A U.S. Navy communications base is also located near Athens, in
the town of Nea Makri, about 20 miles from the city.
   Negotiations for a new agreement have been under way since
November 1987. Kostopoulos has said there has been no significant
progress in eight rounds of talks and that there ``continued to be
a difference of views.''
   As a form of rent for the bases, Greece receives more than $300
million yearly in U.S. military credits.
   A new round of talks on the U.S. bases is scheduled to start
Sept. 9.
   The Greek government issued a formal shutdown notice on July 13
for all U.S. bases operating in Greece, but the legal formality
does not necessarily mean that all the installations will close.
   Moreover, if Greek and American negotiators are unable to reach
agreement, the present accord gives the United States 17 months
after its expiration to dismantle the bases.
   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou insists that the United
States should help solve Greek-Turkish disputes over military
control of the Aegean Sea and the divided island of Cyprus in
return for a new agreement.
   Kostopoulos said in his statement that any prospective agreement
``will have to serve Greece's highest national interests.'' The
disputes with Turkey are often referred to in that way.
   The spokesman also advised American officials ``to take the
Greek government's positions into consideration before they make
useless and untimely statements.''
   Earlier this week, Kostopoulos rejected reported statements by
U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. A Turkish newspaper said
Carlucci vowed the United States would never give guarantees about
a NATO country to another member country of the military alliance.
   Both Greece and Turkey belong to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The report also quoted Carlucci as saying that Washington had
already made this point to Greece.
   Kostopoulos said that Carlucci's statements ``cast doubt on the
value of the (bases) dialogue.''
