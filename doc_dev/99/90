<HEAD>Parishioners Consider Moving Church Out of Kilauea Lava Flow</HEAD>

   An overflow crowd celebrated Mass at
Star of the Sea Church on Sunday as lava from Kilauea Volcano
advanced on them.
   About 50 parishioners met afterward to discuss whether to move
the church, and most appeared to favor saving it. But some wanted
to leave it at the site regardless of the consequences.
   The group decided to forward its opinions to Bishop Joseph
Ferrario, head of the Roman Catholic church in Hawaii, and abide by
his decision.
   One parishioner who spoke in favor of relocating told the story
of a man trapped on the roof of his home during a flood. When a
boat came by, the man declined a ride, saying he was waiting for a
sign from God. He then declined a ride in a helicopter.
   Finally, he drowned. When he went to Heaven, he asked God why he
didn't send a sign. ``What do you mean,'' God replied. ``I sent you
a boat and a helicopter.''
   ``God gave us the intelligence to save this church,'' the
parishioner said.
   A female church elder, though, told the group that if they loved
their church they should allow it to stand at its present site.
   During a previous Kilauea eruption in 1977, a lava flow that
scientists said was nearly certain to overrun the town and the
Painted Church petered out three-quarters of a mile from the
church. Some Kalapana residents called it a miracle.
   Bruce Butts of Hawaii County civil defense said the flow has
moved within 400 yards of the town's center, not far from the site
of the church.
   No more homes had been destroyed by early Sunday afternoon,
although several remain in danger of being torched by day's end.
The flow had light to moderate movement overnight.
   Remaining residents of the subdivision were ordered to move
their belongings out, as lava threatened to block off the two
remaining access roads to the subdivision.
   Some people gathered Saturday night for a ``last night in
Kalapana'' party.
   So far, 115 homes have been burned since the volcano began
erupting in January 1983. Thirty-nine homes have been destroyed in
April.
