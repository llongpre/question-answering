<LEADPARA>  IF ANDREI Sakharov had been alive, the people's hero of the failed Soviet coup
probably wouldn't have been Boris Yeltsin. More likely, it would have been the
balding father of the country's H-bomb, who stood on figurative tanks and
defied authorities long before anyone knew who Yeltsin was.;   For more than
20 years, he was a thorn in the side of the Soviet dictatorship, a beacon of
freedom in an often dark land, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who wasn't
even allowed out of exile to accept the honor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Every revolution has its saint," one Soviet reporter says, "and Sakharov
is the saint and martyr of perestroika. If God sent Jesus to pay for the sins
of humankind, then a Marxist god somewhere sent Sakharov to pay for the sins
of our system.";   It is this amazing story of courage and conviction from
this "saint" that begins tonight's 10th season of PBS's excellent "Frontline"
documentary series.;   Together with an intriguing look at the "Secrets of the
Dead Sea Scrolls" on "Nova,"they offer a 2 1/2-hour antidote to such network
drek as the conclusion of "A Woman Named Jackie." It's TV for those more
interested in docu than drama.;   The Sakharov documentary, made by producer
Sherry Jones and director Foster Wiley, expands the usual hour-format of
"Frontline" by half an hour, and it's worth the extra time.;   For Andrei
Sakharov was one of the century's great men, born four years after the
Bolshevik Revolution. He died 1 1/2 years before the failed coup that seems to
have put an end to what that revolution started, namely communist
dictatorship.;   The most striking thing about Sakharov, which is apparent
throughout the well-done film, is how little he seemed to care for his own
safety and how much he cared about others.;   "His blessed gift," one of the
more than 40 people interviewed about him says here, "was to feel someone
else's pain.";   There was plenty of that to go around in his lifetime in the
Soviet Union.;   He first began questioning the system after he led a team of
scientists on a crash program to build the hydrogen bomb in the mid-1950s. He
hoped the bomb would never be used for anything other than test purposes, but
he was quickly told that his job was only to build; its implementation
belonged to the government and the military.;   He objected to atmospheric
tests until they were finally stopped in the '60s, and in 1968 he wrote his
famous essay "Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom" about eventual
cooperation and rapprochement with the West.;   From then on, he was banned
from secret work. A 1973 interview with a Western reporter resulted in his
constant surveillance by the KGB, and he was later denounced by the Academy of
Sciences, of which he was a leading member.;   He won the Nobel Prize in 1975,
but five years later was snatched off the street in Moscow and exiled to the
closed city of Gorky, not to return until the end of 1986.;   He would live
only three more years. During the tumultuous spring of 1989, the meeting of
the Congress of the People's Deputies and his extraordinary confrontation with
Gorbachev brought perestroika to the masses.;   "The people on top were afraid
of him," one Soviet journalist says. "He was not afraid of them. This was the
dream of every person -- not to be afraid.";   "In the Shadow of Sakharov"
deals with that dream and how Sakharov made it come true. By the end, you may
feel his loss as deeply as the Soviets did. This is a profile of the kind of
man we don't see enough of anymore.; Unrolling the Dead Sea Scrolls; If, like
me, you wondered what last month's hullabaloo over the Huntington Museum's
decision to make its copy of the scrolls available to any scholar who wanted
to see them, "Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls" explains it all -- even though
it was made before the Huntington action.;   This fine hourlong look at the
scrolls chronicles their discovery, their interpretation and their possession
by a small band of researchers with headquarters in Jerusalem, who are loath
to share them with anyone else before they are ready.;   On the surface, it
may seem like an arcane academic dispute, but the value of the material being
analyzed is so significant that it adds up to much more, as this film makes
abundantly clear.  </TEXT>
