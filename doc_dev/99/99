   Dame Iris Murdoch easily envisions the public for
her novels: ``It's the chap sitting by the window reading, or
possibly rereading, the book.''
   Plays, however, are a different matter. ``Why do people go to the
theater?'' she asks. ``Why don't they stay home?''
   The comparisons spring readily to mind for Dame Iris whose new
play, ``The Black Prince,'' is well into its London run.
   The drama, which opened April 25 at the Aldwych Theater, marks
the third West End play from the erstwhile philosophy professor and
author of more than 20 novels, beginning with ``Under the Net'' in
1954 through to the award-winning 1978 ``The Sea, the Sea'' and
``The Book and the Brotherhood'' last year.
   Adapted from her 1973 novel of the same name, ``The Black
Prince'' casts Ian McDiarmid, long a mainstay of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, as a tax assessor named Bradley Pearson who
nurses ambitions to be a great writer.
   The ``black prince'' of the title refers to the Greek muse
Apollo, whom Bradley invokes as the God of poetry and music. But the
play itself is specifically steeped in Shakespeare, particularly
``Hamlet,'' a play which Bradley exalts as ``a monument of words ...
a wild act of audacity.''
   The writing swings from black comedy to tragedy in a surreal
finish that suggests her Czech forbear, Franz Kafka. It's among
London's weightier, more highbrow nights out, and Dame Iris
acknoweldged being uneasy about how long it will survive.
   ``One does want a period of exposure,'' she said in an interview.
   She was encouraged to adapt the novel to the stage by her
producer Josephine Hart, wife of the advertising executive Maurice
Saatchi.
   ``I was interested, naturally,'' she said. ``It's jolly lonely
being a novelist; it's occasionally a great pleasure to work in the
theater.''
   She said a play is a totally different object from a novel.
   ``It's much more like a poem; one's got to pack in a great deal
of action and passion and explication,'' she said. ``Every single
line matters; every word matters.''
   Whereas theater profits from an economy of word and gesture,
novels can be more expansive, and Dame Iris' works have been likened
to the rangy, large-scale fiction of such 19th-century English and
Russian writers as George Eliot and Charles Dickens, Lev Tolstoy and
Fyodor Dostoevsky.
   Such comparisons delight her.
   ``In a humble way, I feel very much I belong to that tradition of
the novel,'' said the author, who was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth
II in 1987.
   ``They are great sources of power. So are men like Henry James,
and I'm very attached to (Marcel) Proust.''
   Her novels exert their own mysterious power, with their
alternately satiric and comic depictions of the witty and
well-educated English tumbling into infidelities, improprieties, and
violence: murder in ``The Book and the Brotherhood''; suicide in
``The Nice and the Good'' and ``The Good Apprentice.''
   ``The Black Prince'' itself encompasses several deaths, alongside
lengthy ruminations about the function of art and the nature of
illusion versus reality.
   ``If you write a story dealing with conflicts of interest, you
encounter forms of violence of various sorts,'' explained Dame Iris,
adding that she does not regard violence as any ``particular
oddity.''
   Her blueprint for novel-writing involves ``some quite complicated
knot involving some character, or a problem.''
   ``I think the imagination just works out of the darkness. One has
to sit and wait.''
   The Irish-born daughter of a civil servant, she moved to England
with her parents as a baby. Oxford-educated, she lives in the
university city today with her husband of 33 years, English
professor John Bayley.
   Dame Iris neither courts nor shuns publicity, preferring to stick
to a daily routine: writing with a pen _ she loathes word processors
_ in the morning, followed by shopping and housework in the
afternoon. Her husband cooks the evening meal.
   Her next novel, ``The Message to the Planet,'' will be published
in Britain on Oct. 2 and in the United States early next year. While
she claims to have ``forgotten'' what it's about, she feels her
craft is improving.
   ``My books have got longer, but I also think they've got better.
If one goes on practicing a craft, up to a certain point one gets
better,'' she said.
   ``Art is very much a matter of courage and confidence, too, not
just ability.''
